If we adhere to this definition, a machine would seemingly lack the capability to autonomously design algorithms. However, recent generative Artificial Intelligence models, such as GPT, have demonstrated an impressive ability to perform complex human tasks with remarkable precision. In this paper, we initially showcase how an AI model can successfully complete an entire college-level programming course, akin to one of the top-performing students in the class. We then put forward strategies for crafting programming exercises that enable educators to effectively integrate these innovative technologies into their teaching methods. Lastly, we illustrate how these models can transition from being perceived as a potential threat to educators to becoming a valuable opportunity when employed judiciously.",

To enhance the generator's representation learning capabilities, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework that integrates generative and discriminative approaches. Our proposed discriminative-generative representation learning method not only rivals the performance of discriminative methods but also offers a significant speed advantage. When applied to one-class anomaly detection tasks, our method surpasses several state-of-the-art models on various benchmark datasets, improving upon the top-performing GAN-based baseline by 6\% on CIFAR-10 and 2\% on MVTAD.

Generative AI models are ideal solutions where models suffer due to scarcity of data sample that hinders the training process be it text, video, audio, and image. Training the model plays a pivotal role, where it discovers the hidden pattern and understands the intrinsic behavior of samples that aid in generating realistic samples. The volume of data that is available for training and the computing power required pose threat on the performance of the intelligent systems, where large language models (LLM) has been an ideal solution. LLMs are generative AI systems that understand human language and provide intelligent, creative solutions to questions. Complex architecture of LLM allows them to capture the intricacies of language more precise, enabling to generate coherent and contextually relevant outputs. This chapter delves into comprehensive analysis on the well-known generative AI models such as generative adversarial networks, transformers, and LangChain. Generative AI employs different training techniques such as reinforcement learning, adversarial training, variational inference, transfer learning, and progressive training on diverse application domains. Furthermore, the study examines the crucial aspect of evaluating the effectiveness of generative models, using a variety of metrics ranging from BLUE, inception score, perplexity, Frechet inception distance, precision, ROUGE, recall, METEOR, BERT, MoverScore, and many more. A comparative analysis of these metrics offers insights into their respective advantages and disadvantages, aiding practitioners and researchers in selecting benchmarks that align with their specific use cases.",

Consequently, the exact ages of the translated results are unknown and it is unable to obtain the faces of different ages within groups. To this end, we propose the continuous face aging generative adversarial networks (CFA-GAN). Specifically, to make the continuous aging feasible, we propose to decompose image features into two orthogonal features: the identity and the age basis features. Moreover, we introduce the novel loss function for identity preservation which maximizes the cosine similarity between the original and the generated identity basis features. With the qualitative and quantitative evaluations on MORPH, we demonstrate the realistic and continuous aging ability of our model, validating its superiority against existing models. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to handle continuous target ages.",

BCGAN adopts a bottleneck layer that uses channel-wise concatenation in the generator to train with meaningful features only. In addition, a dense connection that links all bottleneck layers is added to generate an image which preserves the facial details of the original image. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations were performed using the Radboud Faces Database (RaFD).

To overcome the issue, an authentication system for fingerprint orientation using an improved Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) is being developed. The process begins with image enhancement using Contrastive Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) techniques to increase image contrast. Next, GAN with SVM is employed to generate synthetic data through data augmentation, and decision-making is carried out using SVM. Both real and synthetic samples are binarized using the global thresholding technique, and edge-based thinning methods are applied to enhance the fingerprint patterns. Finally, features such as minutiae points of fingerprints are extracted using the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm, serving as input for the SVM classifier. The implemented GAN-SVM model demonstrates superior performance, achieving a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.12\%, a False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 1.3\%, an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.29\%, and an accuracy of 95.87\%.

AI and deep learning rely on huge amounts of training data that are mostly generated at the network edge by Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors. Bringing the sensed data from the edge of a distributed network to a centralized cloud is often infeasible because of the massive data volume, limited network bandwidth, and real-time application constraints. Consequently, there is a desire to push AI frontiers to the network edge toward utilizing the enormous amount of data generated by IoT devices near the data source. The merger of edge computing and AI has engendered a new discipline, that is, AI at the edge or edge intelligence. To help AI make sense of gigantic data at the network edge, data fusion is of paramount significance and goes hand in hand with AI. This article focuses on data fusion and AI at the edge. In this article, we propose a framework for data fusion and AI processing at the edge. We then provide a comparative discussion of different data fusion and AI models and architectures. We discuss multiple levels of fusion and different types of AI, and how different types of AI align with different levels of fusion. We then highlight the benefits of combining data fusion with AI at the edge. The methods of AI and data fusion at the edge detailed in this article are applicable to many application domains including aerospace systems. We evaluate the effectiveness of combined data fusion and AI at the edge using convolutional neural network models and multiple hardware platforms suitable for edge computing. Experimental results reveal that combining AI with data fusion can impart a speedup of 9.8√ó while reducing energy consumption up to 88.5\% over AI without data fusion. Furthermore, results demonstrate that data fusion either maintains or improves the accuracy of AI in most cases.

In this paper, to align the weights of the generator for better structure consistency between real/fake features, we propose a novel multigraph adaptive GAN (MGA-GAN). Specifically, a Wasserstein GAN equipped with a classification loss is trained to generate discriminative features with structure consistency. MGA-GAN leverages the multigraph similarity structures between sliced seen real/fake feature samples to assist in updating the generator weights in the local feature manifold. Moreover, correlation graphs for the whole real/fake features are adopted to guarantee structure correlation in the global feature manifold. Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate well the superiority of MGA-GAN over its state-of-the-art counterparts.",

However, the existing GIS schemes suffer from the issues of poor stego-image quality and limited hiding capacity. Consequently, these GIS schemes cannot meet the requirements of consumer electronic applications, in which massive secret information needs to be transmitted securely. To address the above issues, we propose a Latent Vector Optimization (LVO)-based GIS scheme, in which the information hiding is implemented by the flow-based generative model during the image generation. Specifically, the LVO algorithm is introduced to compute the hiding probability of each element of latent vector according to its impact on the quality of the stego-image generated from the latent vector. Then, it hides more information in elements with higher hiding probability. The extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to current GIS schemes, the proposed LVO-based GIS scheme generates higher-quality images, while maintaining hiding capacity (up to $5.0 \, bpp$ ) and accurate information extraction (almost 100\% accuracy rate).",

Findings reveal comparable accuracy between ResNet34 and the XAI tool, with ResNet34 achieving a slightly lower accuracy of 99.1\% in contrast to the XAI tool's 99.4\%. However, ResNet34 demonstrates marginally higher precision and F1-score at 98.2\% and 98.45\%, respectively, suggesting a nuanced advantage in precision-recall equilibrium. Conversely, the XAI tool maintains a commendable precision of 97.2\% and an Fl-score of 97.94\%, alongside a recall of 98.7\%, underscoring its effectiveness in discerning positive instances. Noteworthy is that ResNet34 operates as a black-box model, providing limited interpretability, while the XAI tool emphasizes transparency by furnishing clinicians with understandable MGD grading elucidations derived from meibomian gland segmentation and atrophy analysis. This transparency enhances trust and comprehension, which are integral for clinical acceptance and decision-making. Furthermore, the utilization of XAI heatmap generation facilitates data quality enhancement, as evidenced by instances of erroneous artifact identification, emphasizing the imperative nature of artifact elimination for the refinement of MGD grading procedures.",

Denoising and upscaling noisy images are crucial in many computer vision applications, and GANs have shown remarkable effectiveness in creating high-quality images. However, training Style GAN requires huge amount of data and is computationally expensive. To address this issue, this study proposes using various filters such as mean, median, and weighted median to pre-process the noisy images before feeding them to Style GAN. The proposed approach achieves superior denoising and up scaling compared with other system in terms of FID and inception score, and further exploration of hyperparameters and variations of the Style GAN architecture can lead to even better results.",

Despite the criticisms of an ‚Äòintelligence without knowledge or reasoning or the notions of truth‚Äô, ChatGPT is highly effective at human-like conversation with seemingly sophisticated and useful responses to questions, summarization, classification, extraction and generation tasks. Unlike similar large AI models in the modalities of image, audio and video, text-based conversation is straightforward and familiar to a large audience of regular users of the Internet and smartphone applications. This is further accentuated by the large-scale adoption of ‚Äòstandard‚Äô chatbot technologies for trivial conversations in task-specific automation, across every industry sector. This rare combination of highly effective human-like conversation, familiarity of foundational technology and versatility of intelligent application, has led to several challenges and opportunities in leveraging generative AI. A primary challenge is its impact on the academic integrity of scholarly work, where AI-generated content can be useful and detrimental in both teaching and research. On the other hand, ChatGPT presents a unique opportunity in augmenting preexisting (‚Äòstandard‚Äô) chatbots with human-like conversation for advanced intelligent automation, across all application domains. Although diametrically opposed, the challenge of addressing academic integrity and the opportunity of augmenting pre-existing chatbots are grounded in the conversational AI capabilities of ChatGPT and similar generative AI models.

Based on this, a wavelet-based dual-flow feature collaborativing GAN (WDFC-GAN) is proposed, which consists of two encoding and decoding subnetworks, namely the wavelet stream and Transformer stream. The wavelet stream is devised to adopt the wavelet transform for better capturing frequency domain features. The Transformer stream is presented to use stacked fast Fourier Transformers (FFTr) to expand the receptive fields effectively. Besides, a wavelet-based self-attention (WSA) is presented for constructing long-range correlated prominent structural information in multidimensional frequency information, thereby generating better results.

In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a virtual try-on model with enhanced feature representation capability. Through the improved residual block of Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) and the style encoding module introduced by the Pyramid Squeeze Attention (PSA) module, our model enriches the content and style information, strengthens the representation ability of features, and the reconstructed image preserves the more details.

The research focuses on the problem of network traffic anomaly detection in network security, and proposes an improved Transformer and Generative Adversarial Networks network traffic anomaly detection model. The innovation lies in utilizing the Patch segmentation in the Transformer module to reduce information loss, while introducing random masked data blocks to enhance the anti-interference ability of Generative Adversarial Networks, and proposing a class balance model. Therefore, a Transformer Multi Receive Field Fusion (Trans-M) model for network traffic anomaly detection is constructed. The performance test results showed that after category balancing, the accuracy, recall, and F1-score of each model were been significantly improved. The accuracy of the Trans-M model on the balanced dataset arrived 98.12\%, an improvement of 8.59\% compared to before balancing. The recall rate of the Trans-M model was improved by 8.62\% to 97.86\%. On Balanced F Score (F1-score), the highest score of the Trans-M model was 98.46\%, which was 8.18\% higher than before balancing. The experiment outcomes demonstrate that the raised network traffic anomaly detection system is superior to common anomaly traffic detection models and can meet the actual network security protection needs.",

However, large scale outsourcing storage of data, while enhancing computational efficiency, also poses security threats such as data integrity compromise, sensitive information leakage, and malicious tampering. These issues severely impact the quality of generative AI model training and the reliability of system services. Although existing cloud provable data possession (PDP) schemes can verify data integrity, they incur high computational overhead in ITS scenarios and lack support for fine-grained data retrieval. To address the need for specific data auditing by data users in generative AI enabled ITS, we propose a keyword searchable provable data possession scheme, which integrates data integrity verification with efficient data retrieval. First, a lightweight indexing approach is integrated to optimize the keyword search process, allowing different data users to initiate keyword based targeted queries based on their specific business needs, with integrity verification performed only on matching data blocks. Second, an efficient integrity auditing scheme is designed to ensure the integrity of outsourced intelligent vehicle data. Finally, security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves acceptable efficiency in computation overhead compared to existing works, while improving the auditability and searchability of outsourced ITS data.",

    abstract = "Artificial intelligence (AI) holds immense promise in revolutionizing biomedical research, particularly in the field of early medical assistance analysis. This paper explores the application of AI in the context of laryngeal cancer, a disease where early screening, accurate diagnosis, effective management, and favorable prognosis are crucial for patient outcomes. The implementation of AI in biomedical field practice always faces challenges due to data scarcity. The limited availability of data leads to less satisfactory testing results. Even if the methods like geometric transformation and photometric transformation have been applied, it does not still enlarge the diversity in nature of data. Here, we investigated CTGAN on tabular radiomics features in a public laryngeal cancer dataset to check how various amount of data augmentation affects classifier's performance. The results were assessed by the synthetic data reports which captures the similarity with the columns shapes score (median value 71.23 \%) and the trend and correction across columns with a column pair score median value 90.30\%. The synthetic data respect the original data structure(100\%) and overall synthetic data validity is above 81 \%. It enhances the diversity and increase the amount of training data for laryngeal cancer detection. After assessing the synthetic report, a comparison of performances across different classifiers was followed. Result shows an increases in accuracy from 5 \% to 10\%. This proves the positive performance of the classifying improvement on an independent testing dataset (real data) and provides clues how much data should be synthesized. Our paper provides a positive and meaningful reference on tabular radiomics data augmentation for medical intelligent diagnosis design in the future.",

    abstract = "To achieve a high-learning accuracy, generative adversarial networks (GANs) must be fed by large data sets that adequately represent the data space. However, in many scenarios, the available data sets may be limited and distributed across multiple agents, each of which is seeking to learn the distribution of the data on its own. In such scenarios, the agents often do not wish to share their local data as it can cause communication overhead for large data sets. In this article, to address this multiagent GAN problem, a novel brainstorming GAN (BGAN) architecture is proposed using which multiple agents can generate real-like data samples while operating in a fully distributed manner. BGAN allows the agents to gain information from other agents without sharing their real data sets but by ‚Äúbrainstorming‚Äù via the sharing of their generated data samples. In contrast to existing distributed GAN solutions, the proposed BGAN architecture is designed to be fully distributed, and it does not need any centralized controller. Moreover, BGANs are shown to be scalable and not dependent on the hyperparameters of the agents‚Äô deep neural networks (DNNs) thus enabling the agents to have different DNN architectures. Theoretically, the interactions between BGAN agents are analyzed as a game whose unique Nash equilibrium is derived. Experimental results show that BGAN can generate real-like data samples with higher quality and lower Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and Fr√®chet inception distance (FID) compared to other distributed GAN architectures.",

As our framework has a simple form, it can be easily applied to existing CS methods using pre-trained generators. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms these works by a large margin and can reduce the reconstruction error up to an order of magnitude for the presented target applications.

The use of Gen-AI tools forced academic institutions to adapt new policies around the use of AI generated content in assessments and research. Reputed plagiarism checking tools like Turnitin has provided AI detection mechanisms with little success, due to inconsistency in the results attributed to the quality of detection algorithms. Tools like ZeroGPT, Originality.ai, GPTZero, etc., are exclusively developed for detecting AI generated content. However, at present, some Gen-AI based companies like StealthAI, AIHumanizer etc., are offering services that can be used to evade detection tools for plagiarism. These services use advanced algorithms and techniques to identify patterns and rewrite the content to mimic human styled text. This posed serious challenges in identifying academic misconduct. This research explores various tools that learners use or can be used in assessments and research that can evade AI and plagiarism detection. A list of 6 reputed tools like StealthAI, AIHumanizer, ByPassGPT are reviewed to identify how these tools evade AI detection. The problem of academic misconduct is critically evaluated using literature, and the practical implications of misconduct are presented.

Geological facies models are the basis for accurately predicting underground oil reservoirs, geological carbon dioxide storage potential, and groundwater resources. Traditional geostatistical modeling methods can be consistent with geological models to some extent, but there are obvious shortcomings when the characteristics of geological models become complex. Therefore, this paper takes the braided river deltaic diversion channel and estuarine dam phase of the Hanjiang Formation in the Epping Depression of the Pearl River Estuary Basin as the research objective. Based on the geological background of the workings, 3D seismic data and seven logging wells, a conditionally bounded phase simulation based on an improved GAN model is proposed.

Previous works in SSDA mainly focused on learning transferable representations across domains. However, it is difficult to find a feature space where the source and target domains share the same conditional probability distribution. Additionally, there is no flexible and effective strategy extending existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches to SSDA settings. In order to solve the above two challenges, we propose a novel fine-tuning framework, semisupervised transfer boosting (SS-TrBoosting). Given a well-trained deep learning-based UDA or SSDA model, we use it as the initial model, generate additional base learners by boosting, and then use all of them as an ensemble. More specifically, half of the base learners are generated by supervised domain adaptation, and half by semisupervised learning. Furthermore, for more efficient data transmission and better data privacy protection, we propose a source data generation approach to extend SS-TrBoosting to semisupervised source-free domain adaptation (SS-SFDA). Extensive experiments showed that SS-TrBoosting can be applied to a variety of existing UDA, SSDA, and SFDA approaches to further improve their performance.",

Traditionally, architects utilize various tools to create architectural blueprints, including Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams, and state diagrams. Many of these diagrams follow repetitive structures that can be automated with well-defined contexts.

A new Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is proposed to unveil how Human visual perception takes place, focusing on how human beings perceive images, firstly, coarse structures and then their details. The network called 3G-AN consists of three generation stages and a single Discriminator. In this paper, a novel three-branch generator is proposed, which takes into account Coarse, Medium, and Fine structure of a given image. Coarse RGB decomposition image provides the general structure, while Medium RGB stage provides general-fine structure. Finally, Fine RGB decomposition provides fine details of the image. The proposal is tested on MNIST, CIFAR10, and Celebrity faces databases, generating realistic images with almost no anomalies. The RGB decomposition into coarse, medium, and fine, allows to understand the composition of an image from a structural point of view. The qualitative analysis carried out in this research paper outperforms the six most competitive models existing in the literature.",

    abstract = "In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the domain of image restoration, particularly in the context of repairing damaged images and super-resolution reconstruction, primarily owing to the emergence of deep learning techniques. However, during the course of transmission across various media devices, the original image quality may deteriorate due to factors such as the network environment, hardware constraints, and related conditions. Moreover, the restoration process becomes increasingly challenging when the original image quality is low or compromised. Presently, prevailing methods involve repairing the image prior to performing super-resolution reconstruction. However, this methodology typically relies on the utilization of multiple autonomous models, where the efficacy and time efficiency are not optimal. In light of this, we propose a novel neural network model based on GAN, termed ISRnet, designed to repair damaged compressed images. Our method is the first to leverage GAN networks specifically for compressed image restoration. ISRnet integrates the principles of image inpainting and super-resolution reconstruction, enabling the transformation of low-resolution images into high-resolution counterparts during the restoration process, thereby achieving superior restoration outcomes. Despite the partial increase in bias, this approach counteracts the variability inherent in a singularly trained neural network model. Compared to a single neural network model trained on the same dataset, our model demonstrates reduced variance and diminished sensitivity to data, thereby achieving optimal restoration quality and expedited repair speeds for damaged compressed images. Consequently, our proposed methodology presents a promising avenue for the utilization of neural networks in repairing damaged compressed images.",

CartoonGAN is a GAN model that converts real images into cartoon style, and can apply various cartoon styles. In this study, we propose ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks) technology as a preprocessing method to improve the performance of CartoonGAN. ESRGAN is a model that improves resolution using GAN. This method showed better performance than other SR techniques in the evaluation indices MSE, PSNR, and SSIM results. This suggests that ESRGAN is effective in high-resolution restoration ability and visual quality improvement in cartoon style image conversion. The method proposed in this study can be used as a useful tool for high-resolution cartoon image generation. Since the learning data of the model is limited to a specific domain, there may be limitations in generalizability. Due to the characteristics of ESRGAN, which is computationally complex and consumes a lot of resources, there may be limitations in applying it to real-time processing or large datasets. In future studies, it is necessary to build an extended dataset for various images to overcome these limitations. It is important to reduce computational costs by making models lightweight and optimizing them, and to develop algorithms suitable for real-time processing. It is expected that these additional studies and improvements will be utilized to produce high-quality images.",

The concept of edge computing and intelligence, which push the frontier of computation closer to the data source, is a suitable paradigm that aligns with these visions of 6G. In this article, we introduce Agent-as-a-Service (AaaS), an AI-native edge computing framework that leverages AI agents for both the control-plane operations and user-plane services of the 6G network. In the AaaS framework, agents can perform computing, sensing, and communicating tasks automatically by harnessing of the pervasive intelligence offered by 6G infrastructures. By AI-native, we refer to redesigning the whole lifecycle of an edge computing task to align with the prominent reasoning and planning ability of the generative AI. The lifecycle includes plan generation, execution orchestration, resource management, and long-term evolvement. The AaaS framework is built upon emerging techniques such as deviceless computing and WebAssembly to cope with the heterogeneous and geo-distributed 6G edge deployments. Based on the AaaS framework, we conduct a case study on autonomous driving in 6G edge computing to showcase the benefits in terms of overall latency reduction. Finally, we outline potential research directions to form a more efficient and integrated 6G edge computing with artificial intelligence.",

StyleGAN realizes the complete separation of signal features. Therefore, StyleGAN can be used as a tool of data incremental learning to enrich the original data, solve the problem of imbalance between training data and test data, and achieve the goal of improving the accuracy of fault classification in the later stage.

The study employs the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to evaluate the acceptance and impact of generative AI among individuals in creative fields, including students, lecturers, and professionals. Data collected from 127 respondents through structured surveys indicate high levels of engagement with generative AI, reflecting significant curiosity and usage rates. Analysis using SmartPLS 4.0 Tools validated the initial research model, demonstrating that generative AI significantly influences perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention in 2D art creation. These findings underscore the critical need to consider AI's evolving role in the arts, its impact on perceptions of creativity and talent, and its broader implications for the creative industry. The study tested seven hypotheses, with six accepted and one rejected. This indicates that while factors like user computer self-efficacy and quality information significantly influence the perceived usefulness and ease of use of generative AI, ease of use alone does not necessarily lead to a positive attitude towards its use. However, perceived usefulness significantly contributes to a positive attitude towards using generative AI. Additionally, a positive attitude towards generative AI influences the behavioral intention to use it, thereby enhancing skills and providing inspiration for creating artwork.",

The new AI (Artificial Intelligence) -driven technique of generative design has revolutionized the method of design refinement in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) by enabling advanced optimization techniques which was formerly-unavailable. This study seeks to apply the technique of generative design to improve the flexural behaviour of small clear Polylactic acid (PLA) specimens produced through the additive manufacturing process.

Hence, this article explores the interplay between GenAI and DCNs, analyzing their symbiotic relationship and mutual advances. We begin by reviewing the current challenges of DCNs and GenAI-based solutions, such as data augmentation, process automation, and domain transfer. We then discuss the distinctive characteristics of GenAI workloads on DCNs, gaining insights that catalyze the evolution of DCNs to more effectively support GenAI. Moreover, to illustrate the seamless integration of GenAI with DCNs, we present a case study on GenAI-empowered DCN digital twins. Specifically, we employ an LLM equipped with retrieval augmented generation to formulate optimization problems for DCNs (e.g., resource allocation and routing) and adopt diffusion-deep reinforcement learning to solve optimization. The experimental results on a representative DCN optimization problem, i.e., knowledge placement, demonstrate the validity and efficiency of our proposals. We anticipate that this article can promote further research to enhance the virtuous interaction between GenAI and DCNs.",

For early childhood educators, AI can also be a tremendous assistant as an administrative helper, idea generator or data organizer, helping teachers to think outside the box and prepare for teaching more creatively and effectively. It appears that there is a growing need for early childhood educators to have not only pedagogical expertise but also a strong foundation in AI literacy, and that pre-service teachers need to be equipped with the ability to use AI appropriately in their formative or undergraduate stages.

    abstract = "Neural Networks (NNs) are a vast field of research, particularly in terms of adjusting hyper-parameters such as hidden layers (HLs) and hidden neurons (HNs). On the other hand, (NN)s presents the main component of GAN's two elements: (1) Generator (G) and (2) Discriminator (D). It improves GAN as NN optimizes its parts. The number of Hidden Layers (HLs) and Hidden Neurons (HNs) inside the neural networks remains an important research topic despite numerous rules trying to predict the values by some directives and calculations. However, the study of the deepness and wideness of both (G) and (D) is still under-explored, and exploring this topic in GAN was neglected. Hence, this research focuses on the (NN)s contained in the original architecture of GAN and targets to clarify the relation between the number of (HL)s and (HN)s in the Generator (G) and the Discriminator (D) inside GAN. Furthermore, the goal is to determine which (NN) should have the most significant number of (HL) and (HN) in order to improve the performance of the created samples. Therefore, experiments were carried out by (1) increasing the number of (HL)s equally or differently in the G and the D and (2) increasing the number of (HN)s in each (HL) either on G or D. Deep Neural Network (DNN) is chosen as an intrusion detection system (IDS) model and the benchmark dataset KDD99 was used for application. It has been observed that a large number of (HL)s and (HN)s in the (G) improved GAN training and convergence. It means that the (G) should have more critical (HL)s and (HN)s than the (D) to generate better samples. Thus, this study provides the researchers with a vital resource to optimize the GAN's (NN)s and to process the experiments in this field by standardizing the number of (HL)s and (HN)s. The experiments carried out revealed that better training and convergence are seen when the number of (HL)s is 10 and the number of (HN)s is 1024 in the (G). The highest accuracy completed is 0.9991 which is 10 (HL)s and 1024 (HN)s in the Generator, and 2 (HL)s and 64 (HN)s in the Discriminator.",

However, state-of-the-art face editing methods mainly suffer from the following two limitations: 1) they are only applicable to face images with relative low-resolutions and 2) multi-attribute face editing may generate uncontrollable changes in non-target face attribute categories. To solve these problems, we propose a novel High-Quality Generative Adversarial Network (HQ-GAN) for controllable editing of multiple face attributes in high-resolution images. HQ-GAN has two novel ideas to break the limitations of resolution and controllability correspondingly: 1) fine-grained textures and realistic details of high-resolution face images are better preserved with the aid of textural features extracted by the wavelet transform module and 2) desired multi-attribute targets of face editing are emphasized using a weighted binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss so that the influence on non-target attributes is greatly reduced. To the best of our knowledge, HQ-GAN is the first attempt to achieve continuous editing of multiple face attributes on high-resolution images of the CelebA-HQ using only 28 000 training samples. Extensive qualitative results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in rendering realistic high-resolution face images with accurate attribute modification, and comprehensive quantitative results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art face editing methods.",

Artificial intelligence-based scenario generation approach offers a new way to frame uncertainty in wind power. However, generative adversarial networks (GANs) face challenges, including limited ability to effectively capture temporal information, instability during the training process, and susceptibility to mode collapse. To this end, this paper proposes a Temporal Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (TC-GAN) for renewable energy output generation. Temporal convolutional networks are embedded in both the generator and discriminator of conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN), with the Wasserstein distance serving as the loss function for the discriminator. This design enables adversarial training to effectively capture the mapping relationships between noise and scenarios in day-ahead forecasting conditions. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation metric system for generated scenarios was developed, employing statistical analysis methods to assess scenario quality. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed model effectively captures temporal dependencies and enhances the accuracy of wind power scenario generation.",

    abstract = "Attributed graphs are complex networks with non-trivial topological structures and rich node contents. Recently, a variety of algorithms have been proposed to detect meaningful communities from a given attributed graph by combining these topology and content information. However, few of them is capable of detecting the communities of links, which are better to interpret the node behaviors in forming communities. Furthermore, since nodes are possible to grouped into more than one communities, community detection upon links is natural and parameter-free to incorporate overlap, thus revealing the intrinsic organization of attributed graphs in a more reasonable way. In this work, we propose a novel Bayesian probabilistic model to approximately simulate the generative process of an attributed graph given the prior knowledge regarding the distribution of community labels over links. An efficient variational algorithm, namely VBLCD, is developed to solve the inference problem of the proposed model, thus completing the task of detecting link communities. To evaluate the performance of VBLCD, we have applied it to address two practical applications including document classification and social community detection, and also compared VBLCD with several state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of VBLCD.",

However, some challenging issues still exist, such as the overfitting problem caused by the limitation of training size with high-dimensional feature and the efficiency of spectral‚Äìspatial (SS) exploitation. Therefore, to efficiently model the relative position of samples within the generative adversarial network (GAN) setting, we proposed a dual-channel SS fusion capsule generative adversarial network (DcCapsGAN) for HSI classification. Dual channels (1-D-CapsGAN and 2-D-CapsGAN) are constructed by integrating the capsule network (CapsNet) with GAN for eliminating the mode collapse and gradient disappearance problem caused by traditional GAN. Meanwhile, octave convolution and multiscale convolution are integrated into the proposed model for further reducing the parameters of the CapsNet and extracting multiscale features. To further boost the classification performance, the SS channel fusion model is constructed to composite and switch the feature information of different channels, thereby facilitating the accuracy and robustness of the whole classification performance. Three commonly used HSI data sets are utilized to investigate the performance of the proposed DcCapsGAN model, and the performance of the experiment demonstrates that the proposed model can efficiently improve the classification accuracy and performance.",

In this article, we develop a deep generative adversarial network (DGAN) for generating future maps of SSTs, providing a visual method of predicting SSTs. Our DGAN model consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator is designed to produce more realistic maps of future SSTs, which uses multiple composite layers to capture the changes of SSTs and generates clear maps of future SSTs. The discriminator uses the structure of patchGAN to obtain more SST features, and distinguishes between real and generated SST maps. In addition, we improve the loss function and perform convergence analysis, and then, obtain that minimizing the loss function is equivalent to minimizing Pearson $\chi 2$ divergence, and the relevant explanations are carried out through experiments. The generator and discriminator are training adversarially during the training stage, eventually reaching a relatively balanced state, and the DGAN is able to produce more reliable visual predictions. Finally, the effectiveness of the DGAN in the prediction of SST is verified experimentally, and it is compared with the generative model-DL model and the long short-term memory-GAN model.",

    abstract = "In this paper, we tackle the well-known problem of dataset construction from the point of its generation using generative adversarial networks (GAN). As semantic information of the dataset should have a proper alignment with images, controlling the image generation process of GAN comes to the first position. Considering this, we focus on conditioning the generative process by solely utilizing conditional information to achieve reliable control over the image generation. Unlike the existing works that consider the input (noise or image) in conjunction with conditions, our work considers transforming the input directly to the conditional space by utilizing the given conditions only. By doing so, we reveal the relations between conditions to determine their distinct and reliable feature space without the impact of input information. To fully leverage the conditional information, we propose a novel architectural framework (i.e., conditional transformation) that aims to learn features only from a set of conditions for guiding a generative model by transforming the input to the generator. Such an approach enables controlling the generator by setting its inputs according to the specific conditions necessary for semantically correct image generation. Given that the framework operates at the initial stage of generation, it can be plugged into any existing generative models and trained in an end-to-end manner together with the generator. Extensive experiments on various tasks, such as novel image synthesis and image-to-image translation, demonstrate that the conditional transformation of inputs facilitates solid control over the image generation process and thus shows its applicability for use in dataset construction.",

However, with the advancement of artificial intelligence, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has emerged as an effective solution for seismic data denoising. The GAN-based algorithm for random noise reduction in seismic data involves a generator and discriminator. The generator uses noisy seismic data as input to produce denoised data, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the data. Through game training between the generator and discriminator, this method has been proven to successfully remove random noise from synthetic seismic data. Furthermore, experiments comparing this method to the conventional CNN method on real seismic data using evaluation indices such as data visualization and signal-to-noise ratio have demonstrated its effectiveness.

Many advancements have been made in the medical field, with deep learning proving particularly useful when applied to a large enough number of well-defined samples. Although, this aspect may make deep learning harder to implement in settings with limited-size datasets. In this study, we present a new method of chronic kidney disease detection (CKDD) by combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Afterward, synthetic sample data was created using GAN, which enlarged the dataset. Subsequently, processing these synthetic samples, the CNN classifier was applied. According to experimental assessments, the suggested CKDD-GAN methodology accuracy is superior to without the GAN technique. Moreover, the proposed CKDD-GAN-based model outperformed with an accuracy of 98.10\%. Even though standard synthetic data samples seemed to improve classification performance, GAN-based enhancements resulted in a 2.91\% improvement. GAN implementations for detecting chronic kidney disease are highly beneficial since they also increase awareness about its possible uses in various other diseases.",

The Large Language Model (LLM) GPT, developed by OpenAI, is an advanced machine learning tool that utilizes deep learning for human-like text comprehension and generation. This study uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to enhance an online Internet of Things (loT) course at Linnaeus University. We analyzed 12,000+ messages on an online communication platform spanning four years. We compare traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to Generative AI for understanding student feedback and issues, inspiring project ideas, and promoting student engagement. We provide a combined approach to monitor the sentiment or mood of the students' communications over the timeline of the course. Moreover, we show how to use LLM to refine the FAQ generation and decipher student feedback for course refinement. We demonstrate how to generate optimal prompts and prepare the data to apply LLMs effectively. Our research reinforces that strategic use of LLMs, like GPT-4, can revolutionize remote learning by lessening lecturer workload and boosting student satisfaction and engagement. Our future work aims to further leverage AI models across remote engineering education.

Detailed patient interviews are essential in Kampo medicine, as the physician's empathy is critical to diagnostic precision. Typically, medical students develop empathy and deepen their understanding of Kampo's pathological concepts through clinical practice. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed significant restrictions on clinical training. To address this challenge, we propose a novel educational approach to enhance empathy and understanding of Kampo medicine by developing a virtual patient application. This application leverages generative artificial intelligence to simulate realistic patient interactions, enabling students to practice Kampo medical interviews in a safe, controlled environment. The AI-generated conversations are designed to reflect the emotional nuances of real-life dialogue, with the virtual patients' facial expressions synchronized to these emotions, thus enhancing the realism of the training. The suggested method allows repeated practice at any time and fosters the development of essential diag-nostic and empathetic skills. While promising challenges remain in improving these simulations' accuracy, further refinements are still under consideration.",

Our goal was to see if the LLM could play the game effectively without additional training. We integrated the Llama-3-8B model into the Chef's Hat game and compared its performance with three existing agents: Random, DQL (Deep Q-Learning), and PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization).

The results showed that the LLM-based agent performed as well as or better than the RL agents, making smart and strategic moves based on the game rules and current situation. This study highlights the adaptability and potential of LLMs in various competitive settings, suggesting they could be used as effective autonomous agents in human-robot interactions.

The $A^{*}$ search algorithm leverages a heuristic strategy to guide the model towards optimal recommendations by expanding nodes based on cost evaluations, ensuring relevance in structured data environments. Meanwhile, the MCTS utilizes random simulations and backpropagation to explore diverse recommendation paths, adapting to dynamic and sparse data scenarios. The framework was evaluated using the MovieLens-1M, MovieLens-10M, Amazon-Book, and Steam datasets with different interaction ratios.

These biases raise concerns on the dependability and fairness of models that have become widely popular and readily available for public consumption. Existing works in T2I bias analysis typically focus on social biases. We look beyond that and instead propose an evaluation methodology to quantify general bias in T2I generative models without any preconceived notion. We introduce a suite of three metrics; namely, distribution bias, Jaccard hallucination and generative miss-rate, to extensively appraise general model bias. To validate the efficacy of these metrics, we also introduce a backdoor-inspired strategy, which provides a convenient handle over the extent of bias in a model for controlled analysis. We assess T2I models implementing six widely used pipelines in this domain. Our extensive analysis covers both general and task-oriented scenarios, employing over 105 K generated images. For prior art comparison, it also encompasses social bias analysis. Moreover, we also extend our technique to analyze bias in seven popular captioned image datasets. Our experiments establish that our approach is objective, domain-agnostic and it consistently measures different forms of T2I model biases. To further research efforts into T2I model biases, we have developed an open-source web application and practical implementation of this work, which is available on HuggingFace.

Some works proposed to use fine-grained semantic information, relative attributes (RAs), preferences over pairs of images on the strength of a specified attribute. However, they still failed to reconcile both goals for smooth translation and for high-quality generation simultaneously. In this work, we propose a new model continuous translation via adversarial preferences (CTAP) to coordinate these two goals for high-quality continuous translation based on RAs. In CTAP, we simultaneously train two modules: a generator that translates an input image to the desired image with smooth nuanced changes w.r.t. the interested attributes; and a ranker that executes adversarial preferences consisting of the input image and the desired image. Particularly, adversarial preferences involve an adversarial ranking process: 1) the ranker thinks no difference between the desired image and the input image in terms of the interested attributes; 2) the generator fools the ranker to believe the attributes of its output image changes as expect compared with the input image. RAs over pairs of real images are introduced to guide the ranker to rank image pairs regarding the interested attributes only. With an effective ranker, the generator would ‚Äúwin‚Äù the adversarial game by producing high-quality images that present smooth changes. The experiments on two face datasets and one shoe dataset demonstrate that our CTAP achieves state-of-art results in generating high-fidelity images which exhibit smooth changes over the interested attributes.",

To solve this problem, when developing automated technology for personalized marketing messages, there were concerns about the complexity of model development and the quality of messages generated automatically.

The latent space of curve data is often used for clustering. However, the distance geometry in the latent space does not reflect the inherent clusters. In this paper, we propose CPGAN(Curve Clustering Architecture based on Projected Latent Vector of Generative Adversarial Network) for the clustering of curve dataset. Firstly, a novel GAN network structure, which utilizes a projector P (composed of the transposed convolutional network) to reconstruct the latent space of curve data, is proposed. CPGAN utilizes the concatenation of discrete code and Gaussian noise as a latent vector to preserve the implicit signal and structure of the cluster. Secondly, the loss function with two regularizations for CPGAN is proposed to guarantee the robustness and effectiveness of the model. Based on these, the jointly trained projector P is used to participate in the clustering process, while the generator can be used in the generating process. Finally, the spectral dataset from the LAMOST survey, the UCI dataset, and the UCR dataset are used as experimental data to evaluate clustering performance, the robustness of CPGAN, and further application on anomalous detection. CPGAN presents higher results than other methods.",

    abstract = "Deep learning for image denoising has recently attracted considerable attentions due to its excellent performance. Since most of current deep learning-based denoising models require a large number of clean images for training, it is difficult to extend them to the denoising problems when the reference clean images are hard to acquire (e.g., optical coherence tomography (OCT) images). In this article, we propose a novel unsupervised deep learning model called as nonlocal-generative adversarial network (nonlocal-GAN) for OCT image denoising, where the deep model can be trained without reference clean images. Specifically, considering that the background areas of OCT images mainly contain pure real noise samples, we creatively train a discriminator to distinguish background real noise samples from the fake noise samples generated by the denoiser, that is the generator, and then the discriminator will guide the generator for denoising. To further enhance denoising performance, we introduce a nonlocal means layer into the generator of the nonlocal-GAN model. Furthermore, since nearby several OCT B-scans have strong correlations, we also propose a nonlocal-GAN-M model to utilize the high correlations within nearby B-scans. Extensive experimental results on clinical retinal OCT images demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.",

The Metaverse can be utilized in Military GeoIntelligent systems to build a virtual training environment, allowing Defence personnel to practice in realistic circumstances without the need for costly physical resources. The military personnel can practice in a virtual training environment using the Metaverse that can be created with realistic scenarios. This can aid in enhancing their abilities, judgment, and quickness of response. For instance, pilots can practice flying in various weather conditions, soldiers can hone their tactical skills, and cyber security officials can practice responding to cyberattacks. In this paper, we have focused on AI-based technologies combined with the geo intelligence and metaverse which can jointly help in defence to model and analyse complex geographic situations, allowing defence specialists to explore numerous situations and evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies before deploying resources, with the goal of improving situational awareness, response times, and decision-making capabilities across all security-related agencies. The satellite images obtained from the geo satellites give a brief description of a variety of different types of maps and visualizations, including topographic maps, vegetation maps, and thermal maps. These types of satellite imagery include infrared images, the locations of water bodies, planes, plateaus and a number of other surface structures of earth. The imagery helps in identifying the loopholes of spotting the enemy hiding locations and the risky regions of exposure of the native soldiers. The AI model can identify such locations and predict the possible threat locations. When this kind of model is deployed in the metaverse, it can help the soldiers in being trained for war zone like situations. The predictive outcome can handle and analyse enormous data more efficiently, detect possible dangers early, and respond to them quickly. This can eventually aid in the prevention of security breaches and the protection of national interests.",

The dataset comprises 120,000 images, equally divided between REAL images from the CIFAR-10 dataset and FAKE images generated using Stable Diffusion version 1.4. The model's architecture integrates batch normalization and dropout layers to enhance training stability and reduce overfitting. Results indicate a steady improvement in training accuracy, reaching 98.87\% by the 22nd epoch, with a corresponding decrease in training loss to 0.0457. The validation accuracy stabilized at 95.59\% from the 11th epoch onwards, while validation loss fluctuated, settling at 0.1887 by the 22nd epoch. These outcomes demonstrate the model's robust capability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images, highlighting its potential for applications in digital forensics, content verification, and intellectual property protection.

This fundamental data property is not considered in the generative adversarial network (GAN) model along with its its variants; such that original data and generated data often hold different intrinsic dimensions. The different intrinsic dimensions of both generated and original data may cause generated data distribution to not match original data distribution completely, and it certainly will hurt the quality of generated data. In this study, we first show that GAN is often unable to generate simulation data, holding the same intrinsic dimension as the original data with both theoretical analysis and experimental illustration. Next, we propose a new model, called Hausdorff GAN, which removes the issue of different intrinsic dimensions and introduces the Hausdorff metric into GAN training to generate higher quality data. This provides new insights into the success of Hausdorff GAN. Specifically, we utilize a mapping function to map both original and generated data into the same manifold. We then calculate the Hausdorff distance to measure the difference between the mapped original data and the mapped generated data, toward pushing generated data to the side of original data. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments (using MNIST, CIFAR10, and CelebA datasets) to demonstrate the significant performance improvement of the Hausdorff GAN in achieving the largest Inception Score and the smallest Frechet inception distance (FID) score as well as producing diverse generated data at different resolutions.",

Conventional deep learning approaches break down the image production process into a series of sequential denoising autoencoder applications. These applications typically operate in pixel space and result in significant computational costs due to the need for substantial GPU resources for training and inference. By exploiting the latent spaces of potent pretrained autoencoders, this method overcomes these difficulties and permits DM training with minimal computational resources while preserving great quality and adaptability. An ideal trade-off between preserving detail and reducing complexity is struck by using latent representations, which greatly improves visual fidelity over earlier techniques. Furthermore, the incorporation of cross-attention layers in the model converts diffusion models into flexible generators that can process a variety of conditioning inputs, including text and bounding boxes, so enabling convolutional high-resolution synthesis. State-of-the-art performance in image inpainting, class-specific image blending, and other tasks is demonstrated by latent diffusion models (LDMs), which also perform significantly better than pixel-based DMs in text-to-image synthesis, unrestricted image generation, and super-resolution. This research pushes the limits of what is possible in high-fidelity text-to-image applications, showcasing the adaptability and effectiveness of LDMs.",

Therefore, this paper proposes a method to generate subsynchronous oscillation data in power systems based on Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN). In order to improve the quality of the generated samples and solve the problem of training instability, the JS distance is replaced by Wasserstein distance. Taking the oscillation data in the direct-driven permanent-magnet wind farm system as a practical example, the generated data are analyzed by dynamic time warping (DTW) and frequency to damping ratio methods. The results show that the data generated by the proposed method is consistent with the characteristics of oscillation data and has certain advantages in data quality.",

However, manual segmentation is user-intensive and prone to variability among experts due to intricate anatomical details and imaging artifacts. Our aim is to propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-based technique to automatically segment the LV structure, enhancing accuracy and reducing segmentation time and subjectivity of manual segmentation. We propose a novel Bidirectional generative adversarial network (Bi-GAN) for automated segmentation of LV structures. Specifically, we utilize Bi-GAN for segmenting the endocardium region from available myocardium region and vice versa. The adversarial training, Bi-GAN minimizes the losses and produces the target domain segmentation. The analysis is conducted on the cardiac acquisitions for the multi-structure ultrasound segmentation (CAMUS) dataset, comprising 900 echocardiographic training images and 100 testing images in 4CH views during both end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) phases. Results showed a mean Dice of 0.97 for both the ED and ES phases, along with an MAE of 1.90. Conversely, when generating myocardium segmentations from the endocardium, our method attained a mean Dice of 0.88 and MAE of 5.05. Hence, the proposed technique achieves competitive results comparable to the state-of-the-art in LV segmentation, requiring only one set of LV masks (either endocardium or myocardium) as input.",

People expect a more convenient and faster human-computer interface. In the mobile network environment, the accuracy of related image matching algorithms is affected by factors such as bandwidth uncertainty and channel interference, resulting in significant limitations in image feature matching. The deep learning approach of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for dynamic capturing of 3D animation effect generation by using facial expressions. The feature extraction approach utilized the histogram (HOG) and utilizes the GAN in classification for dynamic capture of animation effects. OpenGL and C++ are employed for 3D animation to simulate the rendering. The outcomes exhibit that the face detection approach has attained good performance in both accuracy and speed.",

However, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed image will decrease, and the image will be blurred due to the low photon count in the narrow energy box width, quantum noise and the response problem of detector cells. Deep learning is gradually applied to medical images to reduce noise or improve resolution, which has exhibited promising performance in image super-resolution (SR) by learning a nonlinear mapping function from low-resolution (LR) images to high-resolution (HR) images. Inspired by the cycle-GAN, we propose a novel network model which realize the mapping of HR images to LR images for Dual-Energy CT (DECT) reconstruction. Experimental results show that the reconstructed image has significant improvements in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and root mean square error (RMSE).

These intertwined challenges demand holistic solutions that transcend traditional boundaries. As the digital landscape is increasingly infiltrated by deepfake technology, concerns surrounding the authenticity of digital content are reaching a critical juncture. Deepfake attacks, capable of generating persuasive yet false imagery and videos, pose a grave societal threat. They undermine trust in media, perpetuate misinformation, and raise the specter of identity theft. Image processing techniques for deepfake detection aim to distinguish real from manipulated content by leveraging advances in AI. Meanwhile, the application of AI and machine learning in deepfake detection has yielded promising results, enhancing our capacity to discern authentic media from forgeries. The research converges on a proactive approach, introducing a pioneering framework that integrates AI and blockchain technology.

AI-driven approaches, particularly deep learning, machine learning, and neural networks, offer novel solutions by processing vast datasets from satellites, ground-based lightning detection networks, and radar systems with unparalleled speed and efficiency.

As digitalization upsurges, the requirement for cybersecurity measures becomes even more vital for numerous networks. To certify the security of critical infrastructures, numerous cyber security solutions must be taken together and the essential infrastructure must be developed. Industrial control methods are one of the most vital aspects of the cybersecurity of critical infrastructures. It is possible to entirely stop these physically located devices‚Äô operations and do substantial destruction with a cyberattack. Whereas AI solutions are being utilized in numerous fields, cyber security has started to become one of the concentrated fields of artificial intelligence (AI) domain. Consequently, there are many studies on identifying cyberattacks by utilizing AI methods. It is probable to utilize AI to help and support cybersecurity solutions to develop cybersecurity of significant infrastructures. This study develops a Cyberattack Defense Mechanism using Hybrid Transfer Learning with Snow Ablation Optimization Algorithm (CDMHTL-SAOA) technique in Critical infrastructures. The main cause of the CDMHTL-SAOA model is to improve the cyber security maturity level of critical infrastructures and inspect both traditional cyberattack and AI approaches. Primarily, the data normalization process can be implemented to scale the raw data into a uniform format. In addition, the snow ablation optimization (SAO) algorithm can be exploited for the optimum choice of feature subsets. For the cybersecurity classification process, the presented CDMHTL-SAOA technique applies the hybrid of convolutional neural network and bi-directional long short-term memory (CNN-BiLSTM) method. Eventually, the parameter choice of the CNN-BiLSTM technique has been implemented by the design of the hippopotamus optimization algorithm (HOA). To represent the better solution of the CDMHTL-SAOA classifier, a simulation validation can be tested on a benchmark database and the solutions are measured for various aspects. The simulation outcomes certified the improved execution of the CDMHTL-SAOA method over other techniques.",

Existing ITE estimation methods, which primarily focus on disentangled representation learning, have achieved significant success in estimating treatment effects. However, precisely learning disentangled latent factors remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a Variational Disentangled Generative Model (VDGM) based on a collaborative strategy of Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), Generative Adversarial Net (GAN), and Mutual Information Network Estimation. VDGM infers latent factors from observed covariates by VAE, disentangling factors into three disjoint sets corresponding to the instrumental, confounding, and adjustment factors. The disentangled latent factors can then be used to balance the distribution discrepancy between treatment and control groups, thereby reducing selection bias. Furthermore, VDGM addresses information loss by preserving useful predictive information under the regularization of a mutual information estimator. It also uses mutual information estimators to maintain the independence of disentangled latent factors. Additionally, our model uses the GAN framework to generate counterfactual outcomes for ITE estimation. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines in achieving low errors in ITE estimation.",

However, an important limitation to the bow model is that it often considers two contrasting emotional texts as the same due to dependence on individual terms. This results in a change in polarity that the machine learning models struggle to handle effectively. We recommend integrating a semantic analysis program with a relevant dividing line to overcome this challenge to improve accuracy. By taking advantage of a generative AI-based model, we can expand emotions and increase classification. Transformer-based architecture as generic AI models offers advanced abilities in understanding relevant meanings and emotional shades, leading to more accurate emotions and analysis results. Implementation of Generic AI in emotional analysis can revolutionize emotional applications, including the recommended system, customer response evaluation and social media tracking. Applying AI-controlled methods will enable decision-making in different domains and improve user experiences, more accurate in reference-u-extensional emotional classification, reference income-ownable emotion classification.",

This imbalance significantly impedes the effectiveness of intelligent fault diagnosis approaches. To overcome the challenge, an innovative generative adversarial network (GAN) model is proposed in this study, termed the bidirectional local‚Äìglobal interaction-guided GAN with discriminator gradient gap regularization (Bi-Interaction GAN). First, the generator is designed to incorporate a bidirectional interaction mechanism that accounts for the interaction between local and global features of vibration signals, effectively capturing the deep relationships between local and global information in the bearing vibration signals with limited datasets. Subsequently, the stability of the model is enhanced by introducing a novel loss function that integrates discriminator gradient gap regularization with the Wasserstein distance. This approach aims to minimize the gradient discrepancy between real and generated samples in the discriminator, thereby facilitating a more stable training process. Extensive comparative experiments are carried out to validate the proposed approach using a widely utilized dataset and realistic experimental configuration. The results indicate that the Bi-Interaction GAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) GAN models in generating superior-quality samples while achieving high classification accuracy.",

    abstract = "Accurate segmentation of the hippocampal and its subfields from the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is a prerequisite for volume measurement, plays a significant role in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of many neurodegenerative diseases. It is of great significance for the precise segmentation of the hippocampus and its sub-regions.In this paper, we proposed a hippocampal subfields segmentation approach based on support vector machine (SVM) combined 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN). In the 3D CNN-SVM model, the representative features processed by the 3D CNN are input into the SVM. SVM is trained with the features to achieve the voxel classification of the image, and the segmentation results are obtained. In the 3D GAN-SVM model, we use the generator to segment and use the 3D CNN-SVM network we proposed as the discriminator.The experiments has performed on the dataset obtained from Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIND) in San Francisco, USA. The segmentation dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of the 3D CNN-SVM for CAI, CA2, DG, CA3, Head, Tail, SUB, ERC and PHG in hippocampal subfields are respectively 0.930, 0.926, 0.977, 0.967, 0.931, 0.905, 0.981, 0.870 and 0.911. It demonstrates that combining 3D CNN and SVM achieves a significant improvement in the accuracy of all the hippocampal subfields, and outperforms the existing methods based on the CNN. The DSCs of 3D GAN-SVM are higher, which are respectively 0.989, 0.965, 0.986, 0.977, 0.975, 0.993, 0.818, 0.985 and 0.994. The effect of the GAN-SVM model is also significantly better than that of pure GAN, and the segmentation accuracy has reached the best level on this dataset.Neural network can extract representative features, but it mainly relies on extracting features from a large number of accurately labeled datasets. Most medical datasets are small and difficult to obtain. SVM is more suitable for classification of small datasets, so we combine SVM and neural network to effectively improve the segmentation accuracy of hippocampus in brain MRI images.",

In this paper, a novel method combining multi-sensor data fusion and augmentation for bearing imbalanced fault diagnosis is proposed. First, the limited real fault samples are fed into the one-dimensional Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (1D-WGAN-GP) to generate the fake samples for augmenting the fault data. Then, the features of augmented data from different sensors are extracted and fused by using the proposed multi-branch one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-MCNN). Finally, imbalanced fault diagnosis of bearings is achieved based on the fused features. The performance of the proposed method is verified experimentally. The results show that, compared to existing methods the proposed method can be used to fuse fault features from multiple sensors, and effectively enhance the fault data, thereby achieving excellent accuracy and stability under the imbalanced data of bearing.",

Therefore, the constructed dual-microphone speech enhancement method based on time-frequency fusion and deep learning algorithm has good performance, can effectively improve the quality of the enhanced speech, and can be applied to the actual vocal music teaching scene to help improve the teaching quality, witch has high feasibility.",

    abstract = "Rice is a widely cultivated crop and a crucial staple food in many South Asian nations. Diseases that affect rice leaves can significantly decrease crop yields, but early identification can help mitigate their effects. Recently, machine learning has been applied to address the issue of disease spread. A major challenge, however, is the scarcity of balanced diseased leaf images compared to healthy ones, which limits the effectiveness of model training due to the need for extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been increasingly used to generate synthetic images that closely mimic real ones. This approach has gained popularity in identifying leaf diseases, although research focusing specifically on rice diseases is still limited. In this research, GAN is utilized as a data augmentation method to create synthetic images for balancing Paddy doctor dataset. Subsequently, a hybrid model and Modified ResNet50 are employed for paddy disease classification. The experimental findings reveal that with image augmentation deep learning models learns well and performs best, achieving an accuracy of 99.92\% by hybrid model and 98.8\% by Modified ResNet50 which is 1\% ‚Äì 10\% better when compared with existing models.",

This paper suggests an unsupervised detection method based on skip-connected generative adversarial network (GAN) to address this issue. Specifically, to adapt to the strong interference caused by irregular changes in images caused by irregular water mist and flicker scenes, existing methods remove interference through multi-step processing for detection, which is difficult to apply in practice. In contrast, we use a reconstruction model of convolutional block attention module (CBAM) with skip connections for end-to-end computation, which improves performance while being more concise. This method determines abnormal areas through reconstruction and distinguishes abnormal working conditions by comparing abnormal scores. Finally, this method is compared with existing unsupervised and supervised methods on actual FMF images, and the application results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.",

This study explores a novel model using the architecture ofSwin-Transformer to distinguish between fake and real images generated based on CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks). The Swin-Transformer, a successor model of Vision in Transformer (ViT), applies the structure of the Transformer, which has shown outstanding performance in natural language processing, to the field of images and demonstrates excellent pixel-level segmentation performance. Real and fake images require detailed pixel-level analysis, in which the Swin-Transformer exhibits higher accuracy. Improving the performance of distinguishing between real and fake images is expected to set limits on indiscreet image generation, bringing further effects such as preventing the indiscriminate use of AI images through program-based discrimination/legal sanctions.",

However, due to the class imbalance problem of HSI data, GANs always associate minority-class samples with fake label. To address this issue, we first propose a semisupervised generative adversarial network incorporating a transformer, called HyperViTGAN. The proposed HyperViTGAN is designed with an external semisupervised classifier to avoid self-contradiction when the discriminator performs both classification and discrimination tasks. The generator and discriminator with skip connection are utilized to generate HSI patches by adversarial learning. The proposed HyperViTGAN captures semantic context and low-level textures to reduce the loss of critical information. In addition, the generalization ability of the HyperViTGAN is improved through the use of data augmentation. Experimental results on three well-known HSI datasets, Houston 2013, Indian Pines 2010, and Xuzhou, show that the proposed model achieves competitive HSI classification performance in comparison with the current state-of-the-art classification models.",

    abstract = "Since the generative adversarial network (GAN) was proposed by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014, it has been widely used in various fields. However, there are only a few works related to image steganography so far. Existing GAN-based steganographic methods mainly focus on the design of generator, and just assign a relatively poorer steganalyzer in discriminator, which inevitably limits the performances of their models. In this paper, we propose a novel Steganographic method based on Generative Multi-Adversarial Network (Steg-GMAN) to enhance steganography security. Specifically, we first employ multiple steganalyzers rather than a single steganalyzer like existing methods to enhance the performance of discriminator. Furthermore, in order to balance the capabilities of the generator and the discriminator during training stage, we propose an adaptive way to update the parameters of the proposed GAN model according to the discriminant ability of different steganalyzers. In each iteration, we just update the poorest one among all steganalyzers in discriminator, while update the generator with the gradients derived from the strongest one. In this way, the performance of generator and discriminator can be gradually improved, so as to avoid training failure caused by gradient vanishing. Extensive comparative results show that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art results compared with the traditional steganography and the modern GAN-based steganographic methods. In addition, a large number of ablation experiments verify the rationality of the proposed model.",

Small satellites are frequently launched into space to obtain images that can be used in scientific or military research, commercial activities, and urban planning, among other applications. However, its small cameras are more susceptible to radiometric, geometric errors, and other distortions caused by atmospheric interference. The proposed method was compared to the conventional correction technique using experimental data, showing the similar performance (92.64\% and 90.05\% accuracy, respectively). These experimental results suggest that generative models utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, specifically Deep Learning, are getting closer to achieving automatic correction close to conventional methods. Advantages of the GAN models include automating the task of correcting banding in satellite images, reducing the required time, and facilitating the processing without requiring prior technical knowledge in handling Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Potentially, this technique could represent a valuable tool for satellite image processing, improving the accuracy of the results and making the process more efficient.

Unlike traditional segmentation methods using convolutional networks, we explored the segmentation capabilities of generative networks in occluded areas and proposed a new edge-guided network architecture (RCF-Pix2Pix). The network simulates the human thought process for estimating the shape of occluded areas, using edge and overall contour information from visible parts to infer the shape of the occluded portion. RCF-Pix2Pix enhances the edge features by integrating edge information. It also uses edge contours as conditional input for the discriminator, guiding the network to predict contours in invisible areas. Moreover, by combining MSE-SSIM-L1 loss and edge loss, it improves the accuracy of target segmentation and stabilizes the quality of segmented images, making it more effective in handling complex imaging tasks. Experimental results show that our method has achieved significant improvements on the chip dataset, with an mIOU of 98.9\%, Boundary IoU of 86.6\% (+10.4\%), and also achieved significant accuracy improvements in the D2SA dataset tests.

Meanwhile, EA can provide an optimization framework for LLM‚Äôs further enhancement under closed box settings, empowering LLM with flexible global search capacities. On the other hand, the abundant domain knowledge inherent in LLMs could enable EA to conduct more intelligent searches.

The second stage applies a tempo perturbation technique that simulates the natural variation of speech rhythms by adjusting the playback tempo to improve the model‚Äôs adaptability to varying speech speeds. The third stage integrates the Inception-ResNet module with a temporal masking strategy using an enhanced CycleGAN-based conversion model to efficiently map conformal and non-conformal phonological features while preserving the overall speech structure and resolving temporal irregularities.

In this paper, we focus on the Moir√© method, known for its high accuracy and fast measurement speed. However, when using Moir√© method, shadows and light reflections are generated on Printed Circuit Board surface that cause significant errors in height measurement. To address this problem, we propose a Moir√© Inpainting Network, which integrates the Moir√© method with an image inpainting model architecture. Our approach leverages a Generative Adversarial Network to accurately identify and reconstruct shadow and reflection regions. The network takes 2D Printed Circuit Board Moir√© images as input and outputs heights of Printed Circuit Board. We evaluate performance using Height Reconstruction Rate, Shadow Reconstruction Rate, and Reflection Reconstruction Rate, metrics we define in this paper. Comparative experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art inpainting models for Moir√© images, proving its effectiveness in computer vision applications. Moreover, we achieve a reasonable inference time, enabling real-time deployment in Printed Circuit Board manufacturing.",

    abstract = "Polyp segmentation plays a crucial role in the early detection and diagnosis of fatal diseases such as colorectal cancer during colonoscopy procedures. Timely diagnosis of such catastrophic diseases could assist medical experts and potentially avert impending crisis Over the years, image segmentation in biomedical applications has been undergoing a massive surge especially with the introduction of the U-Net architecture in 2015 and the FCN (Fully Convolutional Network). This architecture went on to become a traditional thresholding and edge-detection technique. Several years hence, more sophisticated deep learning models of the U-Net such as Attention U-Net and ResU-Net were introduced. These architectures have significantly enhanced segmentation accuracy by capturing complex spatial hierarchies. However, conventional encoder-decoder frameworks still face limitations in capturing long-range dependencies and generating fine-grained boundaries in challenging scenarios. In order to tackle the aforementioned issues, several GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) models were introduced to enhance the quality of segmentation masks. These architectures massively outperformed the conventional architectures in terms of dice and IOU scores which are touted to be the primordial metrics designed to evaluate the authenticity of the masks generated by the models. This paper attempts to propose a new Conditional Generative Adversarial Network model called CSRU-GAN (Conditional SWIN ResU-Net Generative Adversarial Network) which intends to use the ability of the residual connections inspired from the ResNet architecture to clip the vanishing gradient problem, the ability of SWIN transformers to capture hierarchical features by making use of shifted windows and attention mechanism. Lastly, it makes use of the adversarial training of the CGAN (Conditional Generative Adversarial Network) while also taking into account the ground truth information. The proposed model when tested on the CVC database performed admirably in terms of the Dice and IOU (Intersection Over Union) scores which were found out to be $\mathbf{9 1. 2 1 \\%}$ and $\mathbf{8 3. 2 9 \\%}$ respectively.",

Consequently, VALL-T retains the capability of prompt-based zero-shot adaptation and demonstrates better robustness against hallucinations with a relative reduction of 28.3\% in the word error rate.

The multivariate normal DL neural network (MNDLNN) classifier and Customized CNN are the most robust feature extraction and classification techniques among the examined technologies. Using Higher-Order Whitened Singular Value Decomposition (HOWSVD), complex data is processed in a way that highlights distinct patterns and features for easy data classification and also increases accuracy.

We focused on enhancing deep neural networks, specifically Residual Network (ResNet) models such as ResNet50V2, ResNet101V2, and ResNet152V2, with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to more accurately differentiate between real and artificial faces. The addition of XAI principles through Grad-CAM not only increases the detection accuracy but also makes the decision-making process of the models transparent, fostering trust, and making the technology more accessible for real-world applications. We evaluated our models using the FFHQ dataset, which comprises a vast array of real and fake facial images. The results demonstrated significant improvements in both precision and recall rates across all models with the integration of Grad-CAM. Specifically, the enhanced ResNet50V2 model achieved a precision of 87\% for fake images and 94\% for real images, with recall rates of 94\% for fake images and 86\% for real images, resulting in f1 scores of 90\% for both classes. The ResNet101V2 and ResNet152V2 models with Grad-CAM also showed notable improvements, with the ResNet101V2 + Grad-CAM model reaching a precision of 87\% for fake and 96\% for real, and the ResNet152V2 + Grad-CAM model achieving a precision of 90\% for fake and 92\% for real, both with high recall and f1 scores, highlighting the precision and reliability of the method. Our approach not only addresses the challenge of detecting deepfakes with high accuracy but also balances the model complexity with computational efficiency. Despite some limitations, such as data set biases and occasional misclassifications, our method significantly advances digital media authentication and shows promising prospects for identity and security verification. Future work will focus on refining these models, emphasizing the importance of XAI, and exploring their application to broader image-classification challenges to strengthen defenses against the evolving threat of deepfake technology.",

This research follows a systematic methodology to identify and elucidate instances of credit card fraud. A Credit Card Fraud dataset was used. Machine learning models, including Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were instantiated. Explainable AI models such as SHAP, LIME, and EBM were applied to the outputs of these ML models to enhance the explainability. The results indicated that the EBM and Decision Tree models achieved the highest accuracy at 96.35\%.",

    abstract = "Over the past few years, neural networks have been used more often to solve long lasting challenges. Remote sensing and data classification were some of the fields that have widely depended on this continuously developing technology. In this context, remote sensing data related to places with harsh conditions have been missing, especially the ones related to SAR imagery. Such conditions include deserts, glaciers, and icebergs, where lots of people have lost their lives in, due to the lack of efficient methods of searching and finding these people in such critical timing. Training AI models on similar scenarios to fasten the process can be beneficial, but the lack of data is an obstacle in the way of development such models. In this paper, we propose using image generating AI systems to generate remote sensing datasets that are difficult to collect using normal imagery, thus creating more efficient image classification systems that can be used in scenarios such as locating missing people. Several AI models are discussed in this paper: Dall-E 2, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, where they are found to vary a lot in terms of the generated images, that could be because of the architecture of the model, and the data they trained on. The overall performance of the AI models is promising. Dall-E 2 performed the best in our tests, followed by Stable Diffusion, and finally Midjourney. This research could open the door to using such models in generating lots of datasets, which might solve crucial problems.",

CycleGAN is one of generative adversarial networks. It has obvious universal applicability, and has a good transformation effect on various types of style transfer. But to the facial style transfer, it only focuses on the transformation of the whole face, and it is not ideal for the transformation of the details of the facial features. How can this situation be improved? In this paper, we use facial landmarks to assist the transformation of facial features. In the beginning, we use stacked hourglass networks to detection and capture landmarks of real faces. And then, use them to assist cartoon faces generation. In view of the fact that the hourglass network has its own advantages in feature extraction, we use it to replace the generator structure of the original CycleGAN for transformation. And in order to avoid the Checkerboard Artifacts and ensure the quality of image generation, we use bilinear interpolation in the upsampling part of the generator to replace the deconvolution of the original generator and the nearest interpolation of the hourglass network. Experiments show that these practices have good results in optimizing conversion performance and improving image quality.",

Deep learning methods have been extensively employed to aid in the diagnosis of schizophrenia. However, their efficacy relies heavily on data quantity, and their black-box nature raises trust concerns, especially in medical diagnosis contexts. In this study, we leverage a deep learning-based method for the automatic diagnosis of schizophrenia using EEG brain recordings. This approach utilizes generative data augmentation, a powerful technique that enhances the accuracy of the diagnosis. Additionally, our study provides a framework to use when dealing with the challenge of limited training data for the diagnosis of other potential rare mental disorders. To enable the utilization of time-frequency features, spectrograms were extracted from the raw signals. After exploring several neural network architectural setups, a proper convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for the initial diagnosis. Subsequently, using Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE), two different synthetic datasets were generated in order to augment the initial dataset and address the over-fitting issue. The augmented dataset using VAE achieved a 3.0\% improvement in accuracy, reaching 99.0\%, and also demonstrated faster convergence. Finally, we addressed the lack of trust in black-box models using the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm to determine the most important superpixels (frequencies) in the diagnosis process.",

Relying on manual counting is not only inefficient but also has large error. In order to improve the work efficiency of product detection, deep learning technology is used to realize automatic counting. The common deep learning counting model is realized by convolution neural network classification, but it can only recognize the fixed number of turns. A full revolution region neural network (FCRN) model is then proposed to solve the winding problem on micro terminal. The model consists of three parts: (a) the Faster RCNN to detect coils from scene images; (b) a FCRN network including a full convolution network (FCN) followed by two ASPP pooling to extract the coil features, and two prediction branches, i.e. a semantic segmentation branch and a regression counting branch to predict the coil segmentation images and to predict the coil turns number, respectively; and, (c) the horizontal projection algorithm to analyse whether the prediction images represent cross coil. The experimental results show that, compared with the counting model directly using CNN classification, the FCRN counting model works well in the environment with fewer samples, and can identify cross coil at the same time of counting, which improves its adaptability and accuracy. Thus, it can improve the detection rate of products.",

The dataset, provided by an electronics manufacturing service provider in Thailand, and is divided into four categories: good bump, head-in-pillow (HIP) defect, non-wetting defect, and solder void defect. High-resolution images were captured with an Olympus BX53M microscope at $1000\times $ magnification, focusing on a 50-micrometer copper pillar (CP) bump diameter. To address dataset imbalances, this research applies image augmentation techniques and generative artificial intelligence (AI) to synthesize additional HIP defect images. The experimental setup involved seven image datasets used to train multiple object detection models, including YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8, resulting in a total of 26 trained models. Results show that YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 required the shortest training time, clocking in at 0.86 hours (51 minutes 48 seconds), making them the most computationally efficient models. F1-score evaluations indicated that YOLOv5 achieved scores ranging from 0.948 to 0.981, outperforming the other models.

The model employs a residual hybrid attention module (RHAM) to enhance the specificity of features, enabling it to effectively collect both spatial information and relevant content within brain tissue. These enhancements enhance the model's efficacy in both traditional categorization and brain tumor diagnosis through the utilization of associative learning and interpretable generative artificial intelligence (GAI). To streamline the intricacy of the design, a global media collecting layer is implemented, and a dropout mechanism is incorporated in the subsequent levels to prevent unnecessary installation. Throughout training, this model makes use of label smoothing entropy loss functions to enhance its capacity for generalization, even with a limited quantity of training samples. The advanced ResNet\&\#x2010;10 network model has been extensively tested and proven effective on brain CT scans, obtaining an incredible 97.47\% classification accuracy.

The current generation of cyber users is being victimized by the interpolation of malware each day due to the pervasive progression of Internet connectivity. Malware is dispersed to infiltrate the security, privacy, and integrity of the system. Conventional malware detection systems do not have the potential to detect novel malware without the accessibility of their signatures, which gives rise to a high False Negative Rate (FNR). Previously, there were numerous attempts to address the issue of malware detection, but none of them effectively combined the capabilities of signature-based and machine learning-based detection engines. To address this issue, we have developed an integrated Anti-Malware System (AMS) architecture that incorporates both conventional signature-based detection and AI-based detection modules. Our approach employs a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based Malware Classifier Optimizer (MCOGAN) framework, which can optimize a malware classifier. This framework utilizes GANs to generate fabricated benign files that can be used to train external discriminators for optimization purposes. We describe our proposed framework and anti-malware system in detail to provide a better understanding of how a malware detection system works. We evaluate our approach using the Figshare dataset and state-of-the-art models as discriminators. Our results showcase enhanced malware detection performance, yielding a 10\% performance boost, thus affirming the efficacy of our approach compared to existing models.",

Data augmentation has been identified as a solution to this issue through generating labeled dummy data. While enhancing model efficacy, semi-supervised learning methodologies have emerged as a promising alternative that allows models to train on a mix of limited labeled and larger unlabeled data sets, potentially marking a significant advancement in biomedical vision research. Drawing from the semi-supervised learning strategy, in this paper, a novel medical image segmentation model is presented that features a hierarchical architecture with an attention mechanism. This model disentangles the synthesis process of biomedical images by employing a tail two-branch generator for semantic mask synthesis, thereby excelling in handling medical images with imbalanced class characteristics. During inference, the k-means clustering algorithm processes feature maps from the generator by using the clustering outcome as the segmentation mask. Experimental results show that this approach preserves biomedical image details more accurately than synthesized semantic masks. Experiments on various datasets, including those for vestibular schwannoma, kidney, and skin cancer, demonstrate the proposed method's superiority over other generative-adversarial-network-based and semi-supervised segmentation methods in both distribution fitting and semantic segmentation performance.",

This agent-driven paradigm ushers in a new level of autonomy and intelligence, enabling complex tasks of networked robots to be conducted with minimal human intervention. We validate our approach through a multi-robot anomaly detection use-case simulation, where robots detect, compress, and transmit relevant information for classification.

The level of mismatch between tasks in the sequence determines the level of forgetting. Catastrophic forgetting is interrelated to mode collapse and can make the training of GANs non-convergent. We investigate the landscape of the discriminator's output in different variants of GANs and find that when a GAN converges to a good equilibrium, real training datapoints are wide local maxima of the discriminator. We empirically show the relationship between the sharpness of local maxima and mode collapse and generalization in GANs. We show how catastrophic forgetting prevents the discriminator from making real datapoints local maxima, and thus causes non-convergence.

The emphasis is on fostering motivation and engagement, achieved through the implementation of a gamified virtual environment and a strong focus on personalization. Our aim is to develop a system capable of autonomously generating learning activities and constructing effective learning paths, all under the supervision and interaction of teachers. The generation of learning activities is guided by educational taxonomies that delineate and categorize the cognitive processes involved in these activities. The proposed educational system seeks to address challenges identified by Physics Education Research (PER), which offers valuable insights into how individuals learn physics and provides strategies to enhance the overall quality of physics education. Our specific focus revolves around two crucial aspects: concentrating on the conceptual understanding of physics concepts and processes, and fostering knowledge integration and coherence across various physics topics. These aspects are deemed essential for cultivating enduring knowledge and facilitating practical applications in the field of physics.",

Performance in the aforementioned use cases might be improved with the help of neural-based data augmentation approaches for generating new data and deep convolutional models for classification. GANs (generative adversarial networks) have recently demonstrated impressive advancements in picture generation. To address the restrictions imposed by the distribution bias problem between the produced data and the unique data, and to provide a more vigorous data augmentation, the presented distribution bias aware collaborative GAN (DGAN) model for unbalanced deep learning in industrial IoT. By including an auxiliary classifier in the foundational GAN model, a comprehensive data augmentation system may be built. In particular, a provisional source of energy with random labels is envisioned and trained combatively with the classification model to appropriately augment the amount of data specimens in minority classes, and a mass fraction system is newly envisioned between two distinct feature extraction, allowing the cooperative adversarial training among some of the power source, voltage divider, and classification algorithm. The next step is to develop an augmentation approach for smart anomaly detection in class imbalance, which, by adjusting for dispersion bias using the properly balanced data, might significantly improve classification precision. Experiment assessments using real-world unbalanced datasets show the superior recital of the suggested model in addressing the distribution biased issue for multi-class classification in class imbalance for commercial IoT applications, as compared to five baseline techniques.",

    abstract = "Edge Computing (EC) processes data locally at edge servers, reducing latency, conserving bandwidth, enhancing privacy, and managing large data volumes independently of central servers, making it critical for applications like autonomous vehicles and healthcare. However, EC is vulnerable to cyber attacks, as edge nodes can compromise edge servers and exploit communication between them. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, which require centralizing communication (activity) data, are ineffective for privacy-sensitive EC scenarios. Federated Learning (FL) offers a distributed ML approach for Federated Cyber-Attack Detection (FedCAD), preserving data privacy by training a shared model locally at each edge server, with a central server aggregating updates to form a global model. However, FedCAD faces challenges with unlabeled and non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) activity data. Existing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) methods for synthetic data generation do not fully address these issues. To overcome these challenges, we propose FedTSRGNet, which integrates novel Temporal Sequential Recurrent Network (TSRN)-enabled GANs with FL to generate realistic sequential data by capturing complex temporal patterns in local datasets. Additionally, we introduce a reformulated loss function to optimize TSRN-enabled GAN training within the FL paradigm, improving convergence and ensuring the synthetic data closely mimics real data. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedTSRGNet outperforms four state-of-the-art methods by achieving up to 89\% accuracy for unlabeled non-IID and 95\% accuracy in labeled IID distributions, representing a significant improvement over comparative methods.",

The latter case is known as the Type I attack which, however, has achieved limited attention in literature. We advocate that the vulnerability comes from the ambiguous distributions among different classes in the resultant feature space of the model, which is saying that the examples with different appearances may present similar features. Inspired by this, we propose a novel Type I attack method called generative adversarial attack (GAA). Specifically, GAA aims at exploiting the distribution mapping from the source domain of multiple classes to the target domain of a single class by using generative adversarial networks. A novel loss and a U-net architecture with latent modification are elaborated to ensure the stable transformation between the two domains. In this way, the generated adversarial examples have similar appearances with examples of the target domain, yet obtaining the original prediction by the model being attacked. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method generates adversarial images that are more visually similar to the target images than the competitors, and the state-of-the-art performance is achieved.",

Simultaneously, personalized learning resources and tutoring suggestions generated using AIGC technology can more effectively help students overcome learning difficulties and improve their academic performance.

In particular, biomedical imaging analysis plays a crucial role in healthcare, generating extensive datasets that can be used to study complex diseases, track their progression, and even predict their onset. This study focuses on an approach based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), a type of generative model that utilizes a parameterized Markov chain and variational inference to generate synthetic samples that closely resemble real data. The model was trained on pneumonia images, producing high-quality synthetic samples to assess the performance of DDPMs by separately analyzing class 0 (healthy) and class 1 (pneumonia) cases. Furthermore, a ResNet-based convolutional neural network was employed for classification tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of DDPMs in generating synthetic images. The classification performance was compared using both real and synthetic images. Additionally, Class Activation Maps (CAM) were applied to provide visual explanations of the classification results, thereby enhancing the interpretability of our findings.",

To target this issue we propose an alternative U-Net based discriminator architecture, borrowing the insights from the segmentation literature. The proposed U-Net based architecture allows to provide detailed per-pixel feedback to the generator while maintaining the global coherence of synthesized images, by providing the global image feedback as well. Empowered by the per-pixel response of the discriminator, we further propose a per-pixel consistency regularization technique based on the CutMix data augmentation, encouraging the U-Net discriminator to focus more on semantic and structural changes between real and fake images. This improves the U-Net discriminator training, further enhancing the quality of generated samples. The novel discriminator improves over the state of the art in terms of the standard distribution and image quality metrics, enabling the generator to synthesize images with varying structure, appearance and levels of detail, maintaining global and local realism. Compared to the BigGAN baseline, we achieve an average improvement of 2.7 FID points across FFHQ, CelebA, and the proposed COCO-Animals dataset.",

In fact, similarity constraint works as a tutor to instruct generator network to comprehend the difference of representations based on conditions. SCGAN successfully distinguishes different representations on a number of datasets. Specifically, SCGAN captures digit type on MNIST, clothing type on Fashion-MNIST, lighting on SVHN, and object size on CIFAR10. On the CelebA dataset, SCGAN captures more semantic representations, e.g., poses, emotions, and hair styles.

    abstract = "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a powerful tool for synthesizing realistic images, but they can be difficult to train and are prone to instability and mode collapse. This paper proposes a new model called Identity Generative Adversarial Network (IGAN) that addresses these issues. This model is based on three modifications to the baseline deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). The first change is to add a non-linear identity block to the architecture. This will make it easier for the model to fit complex data types and cut down on the time it takes to train. The second change is to smooth out the standard GAN loss function by using a modified loss function and label smoothing. The third and final change is to use minibatch training to let the model use other examples from the same minibatch as side information to improve the quality and variety of generated images. These changes help to stabilize the training process and improve the model‚Äôs performance. The performance of the GAN models is compared using the inception score (IS) and the Fr√©chet inception distance (FID), which are widely used metrics for evaluating the quality and diversity of generated images. The effectiveness of our approach was tested by comparing an IGAN model with other GAN models on the CelebA and stacked MNIST datasets. Results show that IGAN outperforms all the other models, achieving an IS of 13.95 and an FID of 43.71 after traning for 200 epochs. In addition to demonstrating the improvement in the performance of the IGAN, the instabilities, diversity, and fidelity of the models were investigated. The results showed that the IGAN was able to converge to a distribution of the real data more quickly. Furthermore, the experiments revealed that IGAN is capable of producing more stable and high-quality images. This suggests that IGAN is a promising approach for improving the training and performance of GANs and may have a range of applications in image synthesis and other areas.",

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are generative deep-learning models that can generate realistic data. GANs have been used in many applications like text-to-image, image-to-image, image synthesis, speech synthesis, etc. Its power lies in the diversity and novelty of the generated data. Despite their advantages, GANs are resource-hungry. GANs‚Äô output resolution and high correlation make it more challenging to compress and fit on edge-devices storage and power budget. Hence, traditional compression techniques are not the best fit to use with GANs. Additionally, GANs training instability adds another dimension of difficulty. Therefore, compression techniques that require retraining are challenging for GANs. In this paper, we developed a weight clustering technique to compress GANs without the need for retraining, hence the name post-training compression technique (PTcomp). We also proposed a clustered-based pruning which adds more savings. Experiments on Cyclegan, Deep convolution gan (DCGAN), and Stargan using several datasets show the superiority of our technique against traditional post-training quantization. Our technique provides a 4x to 8x compression ratio with comparable quality to original models and 14\% fewer mac operations due to pruning.",

    abstract = "Recently, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have made remarkable progress, particularly with the advent of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), which take image and text into a joint latent space, bridging the gap between these two modalities. Several impressive text-guided image editing methods based on GANs and CLIP have emerged. However, in these studies, most of them simply minimize the distance between the target image embedding and text embedding in the CLIP space, and take this objective as network's optimization goal, overlooking the real distance between them may be large. This may result in inability to accurately guide the editing process according to the text prompts and the changes in text-irrelevant attributes. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel approach named CLIP with Mapping-Fusion Embedding (MFECLIP) for text-guided image editing, which comprises two components: the MFE Block and MFE Loss. Through the MFE Block, we obtain Mapping-Fusion Embedding (MFE), which can further eliminate the modality gap, and it can serve as a superior guide for editing process instead of the original text embedding. Based on contrastive learning, the MFE Loss is designed to achieve accurate alignment between the target image and text prompt. We have conducted extensive experiments on real datasets, CUB and Oxford, demonstrating the favorable performance of the proposed method.",

    abstract = "Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has become a widely used and efficient tool for monitoring large-scale, long-term land subsidence. Most applications, especially those related to risky assessment, utilize only the mean deformation rate derived through a linear fit of the InSAR-derived time series deformations without considering the full-time sequence. In this way, the embedded information, such as the onset, duration, and patterns of abnormal deformations, is ignored. This information, however, should not be compromised as it is critical for assessing the risky deformations and recognizing the causal factors. Due to the large data volume, processing the full-time-series information derived by InSAR analysis can be a challenge. In this study, we propose to use the Time-series Anomaly Detection Generative Adversarial Network (TadGAN) to deal with the time series InSAR deformation and recognize the onset and duration of abnormal epochs. The proposed method has been tested with InSAR-derived results over the Hong Kong airport region. It performs better than conventional risk assessment methods, such as the one based on Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) outlier detection.",

ML programming models are trained on data sets before being implemented, with properties to create their own rules or questions. It automatically and gradually improves their efficiency, accuracy, and precision with the number of experiments in which these models (algorithms) are trained. Deep learning (DL) replicates the basic structure of biological neurons, using complex algorithms, allowing predictive digital health and also allowing logical and complex structures to be established, without the need for human supervision. In other words, it is a digital architecture to study, understand, and learn how to interpret information related to the object of study that helps to more accurately identify a tumor, for example, considering that they do not need to be an expert in the field to perform this type of identification through technology. In the same sense as more pertinent diagnostic recommendations, are some examples of the application of this type of technology that can be widely used in various health segments. Emphasizing that it will give the doctor and the patient more accurate diagnoses, faster diagnoses, more assertive treatments, better-calculated risks, possibility of detecting infections, abnormalities, and diseases in a matter of seconds, the use of deep learning in health is very well accepted for reducing the margin of human error.

First, BERT is employed for data preprocessing. Next, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) are utilized to extract part-of-speech and syntactic features, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) capture positional and local semantic features. Additionally, Bidirectional Simple Recurrent Units (Bi-SRU) are applied to model contextual dependencies, enabling deep exploration of textual features. Finally, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is introduced to fuse these features, enhancing their complementarity. Ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of each module, and comparative results on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing baseline methods, showcasing its superior performance.",

However, implementing game theory can be challenging due to difficulties in deriving solutions, understanding interactions, and ensuring optimal performance. Traditional non-AI and discriminative AI approaches have made valuable contributions but struggle with limitations in handling large-scale games and dynamic scenarios. In this context, generative AI emerges as a promising solution because of its superior data analysis and generation capabilities. This paper comprehensively summarizes the challenges, solutions, and outlooks of combining generative AI with game theory. We start with reviewing the limitations of traditional non-AI and discriminative AI approaches in employing game theory, and then highlight the necessity and advantages of integrating generative AI. Next, we explore the applications of generative AI in various stages of the game theory lifecycle, including model formulation, solution derivation, and strategy improvement. Additionally, from game theory viewpoint, we propose a generative AI-enabled framework for optimizing machine learning model performance against false data injection attacks, supported by a case study to demonstrate its effectiveness. Finally, we outline future research directions for generative AI-enabled game theory, paving the way for its further advancements and development.",

To address this, the paper introduces a data-driven approach by applying artificial intelligence technology‚Äîspecifically, for the first time‚Äîinto the field of online setting. A fast computation scheme for online backup protection setting based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is proposed. Firstly, a conditional GAN based on the Wasserstein distance is constructed, using system operating modes as conditional labels. The coordination pairs of backup protection settings are transformed into matrix indices, forming a backup protection coordination matrix, which serves as real sample data for GAN training. The generator and discriminator networks of the GAN are primarily composed of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and batch normalization is applied to the outputs of the neural networks to improve training stability. Next, the specific implementation of the GAN-based online setting scheme for backup protection is presented. Parallel computing techniques are employed to accelerate the computation of both the CNN and the setting values, further enhancing the efficiency of the online adjustment process. Finally, the IEEE 39-bus system is used as an example to compute backup protection coordination matrices under various operating conditions, thus constructing the dataset required for GAN training and validating the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed method can learn the complex coordination relationships among various backup protection settings from real sample data via GANs. It can generate the corresponding coordination matrix according to different operating modes, thereby achieving fast computation for online backup protection setting.",

In this paper, we design an intelligent reminder system based on EEG monitoring. The process of system involves several steps, including pre-processing, filtering, artifact removal, feature extraction, and classification. Preprocessing involves removing any artifacts or noise from the raw EEG signal. Filtering is used to remove unwanted frequencies or amplify desired frequencies. Artifact removal techniques include independent component analysis and template matching, which can identify and remove artifacts such as eye blinks or heartbeats. Feature extraction algorithms aim to extract significant information from the processed signal. Classification algorithms are then used to classify the extracted features into specific categories, such as cognitive states, diseases, or mental tasks. Commonly used classification algorithms include support vector machines, neural networks, and linear discriminant analysis. EEG collection can potentially have an effect on reminding fatigue driving, as it may increase drivers' awareness of their cognitive states and alert them to signs of fatigue. By monitoring the electrical activity of the brain, EEG can provide real-time feedback on changes in cognitive states, such as decreased attention or increased drowsiness.",

To solve the issue, researchers have proposed many different detection models. However, in actual business scenarios, fraudulent transactions usually only account for a small portion of normal transactions, resulting in extremely imbalanced data. Besides, the concealment of fraud is reflected in that the fraudsters are imitating the normal transactions of users, posing a huge challenge for fraudulent transaction detection modeling. Inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs), we propose a GAN-based framework to detect online banking fraud on extremely imbalanced data, called BalanceGAN. A fraud detection model is first pretrained using the data generated by the generator and then the model is fine-tuned using transfer learning on real-world datasets, by using this approach to address data imbalances. Compared with the conventional methods for solving imbalanced data, our BalanceGAN can avoid over-fitting of the model relatively, experiments on two real datasets show that our BalanceGAN has more than 10\% performance improvement in Precision and Recall.",

    abstract = "Skeleton-based action recognition has attracted great interest in computer vision. For this task, a challenging problem concerns the large intraclass variances of skeleton data, which are mainly caused by diverse viewpoints and subjects, and greatly increase the difficulty of modeling actions through a network. To address the above problem, we propose a variance reduction (VaRe) framework for skeleton-based action recognition, which consists of a view-normalization generative adversarial network (VN-GAN), a subject-independent network (SINet) and a classification network. First, the VN-GAN is responsible for reducing view-induced intraclass variances. Specifically, this network, comprising a generator and a discriminator, is aimed at learning a mapping from a diverse-view skeleton distribution to a unified-view skeleton distribution in an unsupervised manner, thereby generating a view-normalized skeleton. Second, taking the view-normalized skeleton as input, the SINet focuses on reducing the influences of the personal habits of subjects on action recognition. To generate SI skeleton data, the SINet automatically adjusts the human pose according to the human kinematic structure under a classification loss constraint. Finally, without the interference of view- and subject-induced variances, the classification network can concentrate more on learning discriminative action features to predict classes. Furthermore, by combining the joint and bone modalities, the proposed framework achieves competitive performance on three benchmarks: NTU RGB+D, NTU-120 RGB+D and Northwestern-UCLA Multiview Action 3D.",

    abstract = "Due to its capability for all-weather, all-time information acquisition, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) plays a vital role in the field of Earth observation. However, the specificity of the radar sensor and the complexity of electromagnetic scattering imaging physics result in SAR images lacking the intuitiveness of optical images, making them unsuitable for interpretation by nonexperts. A common approach to tackle this challenge is to use a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to translate SAR images into optical images, thereby enhancing readability and assisting nonexperts in interpretation while filling the gaps in optical data due to acquisition constraints. Nevertheless, traditional cGAN-based methods are limited by inadequate global semantic information extraction and poor detail preservation, leading to translated images with incoherent texture and color, and blurred edge. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid vision transformer cGAN (HVT-cGAN) for SAR-to-optical image translation (S2OIT). In our proposed HVT-cGAN, the generator utilizes a convolutional stem for patch embedding and encoding. The parallel CNN branch and vision transformer (ViT) branch are employed for the extraction and mapping of local and global information, respectively. Moreover, we propose a novel attention-based feature fusion module, named the convolutional attention fusion module (CAFM), which can adaptively aggregate local and global information from parallel branches by learning both channel-wise and spatial-wise relations. Benefiting from these improvements, our method achieves superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons with other methods on the SEN1-2 dataset. In addition, the results of multiple ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

This has concurrently escalated social problems and concerns related to AI image generation, underscoring the necessity for an effective AI-generated-image detection method. Therefore, numerous methods for detecting AI-generated images have been developed, but there remains a need for research comparing the effectiveness of and visualizing these detection methods. In this study, we classify AI-generated-image detection methods by the image features they use and compare their generalization performance in detecting AI-generated images of different types. We selected five AI-generated-image detection methods for performance evaluation and selected vision transformer as an additional method for comparison. We use two types of training datasets, i.e., ProGAN and latent diffusion; combine existing AI-generated-image test datasets into a diverse test dataset; and divide them into three types of generative models, i.e., generative adversarial network (GAN), diffusion, and transformer, to evaluate the comprehensive performance of the detection methods. We also analyze their detection performance on images with data augmentation, considering scenarios that make it difficult to detect AI-generated images. Grad-CAM and t-SNE are used to visualize the detection area and data distribution of each detection method. As a result, we determine that artifact-feature-based detection performs well on GAN and real images, whereas image-encoder-feature-based detection performs well on diffusion and transformer images. In summary, our research analyzes the comparative detection performance of various AI-generated-image detection methods, identifies their limitations, and suggests directions for further research.",

In addition, to guide the GAI model in producing contextually relevant content, a discriminator is incorporated into Gen-SC to measure the disparity between generated samples and actual samples.

This semantic information, expressed in textual instruction, is then transmitted based on joint source-channel codec. At the receiver, the diffusion model, guided by both received semantic information and synchronized background knowledge, iteratively generates the recovered image through the reverse denoising process. Furthermore, the semantic knowledge base provides background knowledge for both transceivers, defined as the semantically similar image retrieved.

School and family tutoring offer personalized help and provide positive feedback on students' learning. Predicting students' performance is of much interest which reflects their understanding on the subjects. Particularly it is desired students to manage well in fundamental knowledge in order to build a strong foundation for post-secondary studies and career. In this paper, improved conditional generative adversarial network based deep support vector machine (ICGAN-DSVM) algorithm has been proposed to predict students' performance under supportive learning via school and family tutoring. Owning to the nature of the students' academic dataset is generally low sample size. ICGAN-DSVM offers dual benefits for the nature of low sample size in students' academic dataset in which ICGAN increases the data volume whereas DSVM enhances the prediction accuracy with deep learning architecture. Results with 10-fold cross-validation show that the proposed ICGAN-DSVM yields specificity, sensitivity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.968, 0.971 and 0.954 respectively. Results also suggest that incorporating both school and family tutoring into the prediction model could further improve the performance compared with only school tutoring and only family tutoring. To show the necessity of ICGAN and DSVM, comparison has been made between ICGAN and traditional conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). Also, the proposed kernel design via heuristic based multiple kernel learning (MKL) is compared with typical kernels including linear, radial basis function (RBF), polynomial and sigmoid. The prediction of student's performance with and without GAN is presented which is followed by comparison with DSVM and with traditional SVM. The proposed ICGAN-DSVM outperforms related works by 8-29\% in terms of performance indicators specificity, sensitivity and AUC.",

    abstract = "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness and vision loss worldwide. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), approximately one-third of individuals with diabetes, equivalent to 32.2\%, are affected by some form of DR. Due to the uneven data distribution, intra-class variance, and a dearth of ophthalmologists, DR diagnosis is considered challenging. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and supervised learning techniques have been potentially useful in computer vision applications. However, unsupervised CNN has received less attention. Moreover, it is more manageable to use synthetic images for model training with the recent advancements in graphics. Therefore, the proposed method combines the actual and augmented views using the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) algorithm. The generated views are implemented to balance the minority class in the imbalanced dataset. Furthermore, a novel ensemble convolutional neural network algorithm named Different View Ensemble (DVE) that merges the weighted average prediction of CNN, CNN-i, and CNN+i algorithms has been proposed. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the DDR and EyePACS datasets, and its performance is compared with K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), and Autoencoder-based Deep Embedded Clustering Techniques (DEC). The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm, achieving an accuracy rate of 97.4\%, specificity of 99.6\%, and sensitivity of 92.3\%. The promising results underscore the potential impact of this methodology in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of automated diagnostic systems in the field of ophthalmology. Notably, the evaluation considers imbalanced data and a DCGAN-balanced dataset, where the proposed approach exhibits even better performance with balanced classes.",

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) models have become an important technology for diagnosing induction motor faults. These AI models can only accurately identify faults when trained on a complete dataset. However, it is difficult to obtain a complete dataset in practical engineering scenarios, which will worsen the performance of AI models. To solve the problem, a numerical model-aided intelligent diagnosis method is proposed. First, a numerical model of the health induction motor is established, and the model is updated using measured health signals. Subsequently, various types of fault mathematical models are injected into the healthy numerical model to obtain simulated fault samples. Finally, the simulated and/or measured signals are used to train the convolutional neural network (CNN). The experimental results show that the model has achieved satisfactory results to construct a relatively complete dataset for engineering applications.",

One drawback of these methods is that they lack enough transparency, hence, cannot be fully trusted in vital domains. To this end, this paper deal with the class imbalance learning task with counterfactual instances. Given an instance and a classifier, a counterfactual is a fake instance which, while having smallest distance to the original instance, is classified as a different class by the classifier. Therefore, the most important features for a classifier can be identified by inspecting the difference between an instance and its counterfactual. To utilize counterfactuals, a novel Explainable Generative Adversarial Network (EXGAN) is proposed. EXGAN has a unique ‚Äútwo generators versus multiple discriminators‚Äù architecture where the generators are used to generate effective counterfactuals and discriminators are trained for the class imbalance learning task. In addition to the architecture, an innovative ensemble loss function ensuring each discriminator complementing each other is designed to overcome the class imbalance issue. Extensive experiments prove that the counterfactuals generated by EXGAN can be used to produce effective local explanation and provide significant better class imbalance learning ability than existing competitors.",

However, developing ML solutions for production-ready industrial settings presents various challenges, such as data scarcity and dataset imbalance, which are further amplified when dealing with tabular data. To overcome such issues we investigate the use of various Deep Generative Models (DGMs) to generate synthetic data that closely mimics real-world conditions. Despite extensive studies of DGMs in the literature, there is still limited knowledge of their practical suitability in Industry 5.0 environments. Our research includes a detailed evaluation of several DGMs, such as Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, and Diffusion Models, implemented in the gearbox assembly and testing line in the Bonfiglioli EVO plant.

Portable consumer electronics devices (PCED), such as smartphones, smart tablets, and PCs, also utilize fingerprint as a authentication method of AFIS. In recent years, the emergence of adversarial examples reveals the vulnerability of DNNs and weakens the credibility of PCED. Existing adversarial examples generally adopt perturbation addition, which lack robustness in the face of defensive measures such as adversarial training. Moreover, the perturbations used to deceive DFFD are easily perceived by human eyes. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a novel generative adversarial fingerprint attack method for PCED. Firstly, to address the issue of poor robustness against defense strategies, this paper proposes a ridge texture rendering based generative adversarial network (RTRGAN) to perform robust generative adversarial fingerprint attack. Subsequently, to further enhance the visual quality of adversarial fingerprints, the realistic ridge texture is assigned by comparing the feature similarity between real fingerprints and adversarial fingerprints. Finally, this paper designs a joint optimization loss function, including the discriminator loss and the adversarial loss, to balance the attack robustness and visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with traditional perturbation-based methods, the proposed scheme significantly improves the attack success rate, has remarkable robustness, and generates more realistic adversarial fingerprints to human perception.",

Existing approaches suffer from the inherent bias of the learned classifier towards the seen action categories. As a consequence, unseen category samples are incorrectly classified as belonging to one of the seen action categories. In this paper, we set out to tackle this issue by arguing for a separate treatment of seen and unseen action categories in generalized zero-shot action recognition. We introduce an out-of-distribution detector that determines whether the video features belong to a seen or unseen action category. To train our out-of-distribution detector, video features for unseen action categories are synthesized using generative adversarial networks trained on seen action category features. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an out-of-distribution detector based GZSL framework for action recognition in videos. Experiments are performed on three action recognition datasets: Olympic Sports, HMDB51 and UCF101. For generalized zero-shot action recognition, our proposed approach outperforms the baseline with absolute gains (in classification accuracy) of 7.0\%, 3.4\%, and 4.9\%, respectively, on these datasets.",

However, to learn high-fidelity image-mask synthesis, existing GAN approaches first need a pre-training phase requiring large amounts of image data, which limits their utilization in restricted image domains. In this work, we take a step to reduce this limitation, introducing the task of one-shot image-mask synthesis. We aim to generate diverse images and their segmentation masks given only a single labelled example, and assuming, contrary to previous models, no access to any pre-training data. To this end, inspired by the recent architectural developments of single-image GANs, we introduce our OSMIS model which enables the synthesis of segmentation masks that are precisely aligned to the generated images in the one-shot regime. Besides achieving the high fidelity of generated masks, OSMIS outperforms state-of-the-art single-image GAN models in image synthesis quality and diversity. In addition, despite not using any additional data, OSMIS demonstrates an impressive ability to serve as a source of useful data augmentation for one-shot segmentation applications, providing performance gains that are complementary to standard data augmentation techniques.

    abstract = "The scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare diseases, limits the variability of training data and the range of detectable lesions, presenting a significant challenge for supervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. To solve this problem, we propose a novel unsupervised method for medical image anomaly detection: Attention-Augmented Differentiable top-k Feature Adaptation (ADFA). The method utilizes Wide-ResNet50-2 (WR50) network pre-trained on ImageNet to extract initial feature representations. To reduce the channel dimensionality while preserving relevant channel information, we employ an attention-augmented patch descriptor on the extracted features. We then apply differentiable top-k feature adaptation to train the patch descriptor, mapping the extracted feature representations to a new vector space, enabling effective detection of anomalies. Experiments show that ADFA outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on multiple challenging medical image datasets, confirming its effectiveness in medical anomaly detection.",

However, these methods have two major drawbacks: speech input lacks discrimination and the intra-modal semantic information is under used. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel cross-modal feature fusion retrieval model. Our model provides a more optimized cross-modal common feature space than previous models and thus optimizes the retrieval performance. First, our model adds the extra textual keyword information to the audio feature for remote sensing image retrieval. Second, it introduces inter-modality adversarial learning and intra-modality semantic discrimination into the remote sensing image-voice retrieval task. We conducted experiments on two datasets modified from the UCM-Captions dataset and the Remote Sensing Image Caption Dataset.

Mobility management is used for many cases, such as urban management, location-based services (LBS), collision avoidance and tourism industry improvement. On the other hand, the dramatic advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have attracted much attention to the use of this tool in network management, using which they can quickly predict the following route or destination of users in the network in different scenarios. However, there are many challenges in this field, and ignoring them reduces the accuracy of the models. In this paper, We introduce the methods that researchers have presented and mention the advantages and disadvantages of each. The articles used include reputable journals from 2020 to 2025. Mobility management is done by focusing on four topics human mobility, vehicle, aircraft and ship. After introducing the approaches, we categorized and compared these models with related articles. Then, we showed the important items used in the articles, such as datasets, in the diagram and introduced the most used and famous ones. Also, commonly used metrics were reviewed.

The preservation of skeletal structural details is crucial to avoid disease misidentification and to achieve accurate medical diagnosis and treatment planning. In this paper, a frequency-separated diffusion model (FSDM) is proposed to maintain skeletal structural details, whereby a frequency-separated module can effectively separate the frequency components of medical images in the Fourier domain. In the proposed FSDM, a frequency conversion module is incorporated to convert the MR images into frequency-specific outputs. It leverages the frequency-specific information to guide a subsequent diffusion model for MR-to-CT translation. The results on a public brain dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in metrics of Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Our experiments show that FSDM can generate high-quality CT images while preserving skeletal structural details. Our code will be publicly available.",

    abstract = "Image-to-image translation is a fundamental task in computer vision that transforms images between domains while preserving essential content. Although adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) is widely used for style transfer, its reliance on simple statistical measures (mean and variance) may limit its ability to capture complex style characteristics. We propose a novel framework that enhances style transfer by combining AdaIN with Gram matrices, leveraging the complementary strengths of both approaches. Our method introduces two key innovations for enhanced feature attribution: 1) dual Gram matrix-based loss functions (G1 and G2), which operate at different stages of the generation process to capture richer style information by establishing deeper correlations between feature maps, and 2) a balanced training objective that integrates perceptual loss with cycle-consistency loss to maintain content fidelity during style transfer. This comprehensive feature attribution mechanism enables our model to decompose and reassign stylistic elements across domains more precisely. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that each component of our framework contributes to performance improvements, with the complete model achieving the best results on both the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation, using distribution similarity metrics, classification-based assessments, and visual comparisons, demonstrates that our approach effectively captures and transfers complex style characteristics while preserving content integrity, outperforming state-of-the-art models. Specifically, our model achieves superior Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) scores (19.88 vs. 24.22) and recognition accuracy (0.966 vs. 0.941) compared to StarGAN v2, confirming the performance gains introduced by our enhanced feature attribution strategy.",

Most existing deep learning-based detection methods require sufficient labeled data to train classifiers. But much labeled traffic is difficult to obtain in practical applications. To solve this problem, we propose and implement a semi-supervised malicious traffic detection method based on improved Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalized (WGAN-GP), denoted as SEMI-WGAN-GP. First, we construct a pseudo- feature map (PFM) for each stream in the dataset using the time-series properties of consecutive packets in a given stream. Second, we fix the generator and only train the discriminator on a few labeled PFMs, which obtain a discriminator that can distinguish malicious from benign traffic. Finally, the generator and discriminator are trained unsupervisedly in the adversarial setting, which allows the discriminator to improve detection performance by generator-generated PFMs. Experiments on the publicly available UNSW-NB15 dataset demonstrate that SEMI-WGAN-GP can achieve 90.53\% accuracy using a few labeled samples (20\% of the samples in the dataset are marked), exceeding the 79.92\% and 84.94\% of fully supervised multilayer perceptron network (MLP) and 2- dimensional convolutional neural network (2DCNN).

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are attracting widespread interest in the data science community for their prowess in image feature recognition due to their adversarial nature of training. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is known as the process of obtaining a neural architectural schema that performs the best for a particular task. NAS has been applied in GANs, and it achieved striking success compared to human-designed architectures in conditional and unconditional image generation and GAN-compression. Our research was inspired by the success of NAS applied in GANs. This paper proposes a novel approach for NAS in GANs for semantic image segmentation. After extensive research on related works, the architecture of the Pix2Pix GAN variant was selected for the proposed approach. The architecture of the Pix2Pix GAN consists of a U-Net as the Generator and a PatchGAN classifier as the Discriminator. The NAS component is searched for U-Net architectures using PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. The NAS component is adapted from using the NAS-Unet research proposed by Weng et al. in 2019. The NAS searched architecture was used as the Generator of the proposed GAN by transferring the searched architecture from the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset to the Cityscapes dataset. To determine the success of the proposed approach, quantitative analysis was performed with Mean Pixel Accuracy (MPA) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metrics. Several experiments were done on the Cityscape validation set and achieved 81.73 MPA and 71.91 mIoU. The proposed approach outperformed several NAS in semantic segmentation approaches and GANs in semantic segmentation approaches. This study is a preliminary attempt to apply NAS for semantic segmentation using GANs. Further, this research has raised many possible areas in need of further investigation.",

The traditional image completion technology mainly fills the missing areas with missing values based on the information of the unmissed areas of the image. Traditional image completion can well complement images with a small missing area and relatively simple texture structure, but it does not work well for images with large missing areas or complex texture structures. With the continuous development of deep learning, the performance of image restoration has been significantly improved. The image completion method based on deep learning can learn the high-level features of the image, so that the result of the completion is more realistic. This article reviews the image completion technology, introduces the basic principles of typical methods and compares their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we analyze the future research directions in this field and put forward prospects.",

Thus, we propose a novel method for user-guided image inpainting, this method can achieve interactive object extraction in the guided image and add the target object to the original image reasonably. Our model splits this task into three parts: interactive mask extractor, guided feature extractor and inpainting network. The interactive mask extractor can interactively extract the target object from the guided image. Then, we adopt the guided feature extractor to extract the features of the target object, Finally, the inpainting network generates the fine-grained images by fusing the features from the original and guided image. The experimental results prove that our model has a higher inpainting quality than the existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

A quantitative experiment with 118 participants was conducted, using a structured questionnaire for data collection. The analysis applied Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS software to examine the relationships between AI content characteristics and consumer intent. Results indicate that novelty and perceived eeriness of AI-generated advertisements significantly influence consumer travel intentions. Additionally, the synthesis of artificial elements in the ads impacts perceived eeriness, which indirectly affects travel intent. These findings suggest that while AI-generated advertisements can enhance novelty, addressing perceptions of eeriness is crucial for optimizing consumer engagement.

This study aims to address both issues by introducing new locally conditioned generative adversarial networks (LCGAN). Inspired by self-supervised representation learning, we devise intuitive learning signals and training tactics to learn the local patch encoding for developing the locally controllable latent space of GANs. Powered by local patch encoding with our novel loss design, the proposed model successfully performs locally conditioned image generation while covering various attributes. Utilizing LCGAN, ordinary users can easily design an image by browsing its patch-level appearance from various patch examples, even including out-of-domain examples. Besides, LCGAN, with latent optimization, offers high-quality results in local editing. Experimental evaluations verify that our model is effective in both conditional generation and local editing in achieving both image quality and fidelity. Our method is the most preferred by 55.78\% of user study participants, and it achieved Fr√©chet inception distance scores of 16.24 and 15.01 on the FFHQ and AFHQ-cat datasets, respectively. Especially, a comprehensive user study supports that: 1) trade-off between quality and fidelity exists in existing methods and 2) our model is the first to alleviate their trade-off relationships, showing the potential in practical image editing applications.",

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based framework named A2GP-SF, which integrates attribute generative prompting (AGP) and adaptive sharpness flattening (ASF). The proposed AGP paradigm dynamically generates attribute-aware prompts for each instance, facilitating better semantics learning and enhancing plasticity. Additionally, the ASF mechanism aims to mitigate overfitting by applying adaptive perturbations to flatten sharpness, with these perturbations adjusted based on gradient norm changes, thereby enhancing the model‚Äôs robustness and generalization.

Our previous work [1] proposed a joint image-to-image translation (JI2IT) method for real-world blind traffic monitoring driver face (TMDF) image restoration, whereas JI2IT is unsatisfactory to restore the facial details of real-world blind TMDF images. To tackle above issue, this paper proposes a RestormGAN for real-world image (i.e., TMDF image) restoration which consists of a channel axis attention based Restormer (CAR) encoder and a generative facial prior (i.e., GAN prior). Specifically, we propose to insert a novel channel height and width axes attention (CHWA) module into Restormer module to form CAR module, where CHWA contains the height-axis attention module (HAM) and the width-axis attention module (WAM). The HAM learns a weight for the height-axis of each channel while WAM learns a weight for the width-axis of each channel. Then the dual down-sampling (DDS) module is proposed to ensure the CAR encoder can be efficiently connected with GAN prior. DDS uses bilinear sampling and pixelunshuffle in parallel to generate more representative parameters. Finally, we propose to combine multi-handcraft degradations strategy and pretrained degradation model to construct massive image pairs for the training of RestormGAN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RestormGAN achieves state-of-the-art performances for real-world face restoration and superior results in traffic monitoring scenarios.",

The predominated methods for the Chinese font generation are based on deep generative models, especially the generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, existing GAN-based methods (say, CycleGAN) for the Chinese font generation usually suffer from the mode collapse issue, mainly due to the lack of effective information guidance. This paper proposes a novel information guidance module called the skeleton guided channel expansion (SGCE) module for the Chinese font generation through integrating the skeleton information into the generator with the channel expansion way, motivated by the observation that the skeleton embodies both local and global structure information of Chinese characters. We conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed module. Numerical results show that the mode collapse issue suffered by the known CycleGAN can be effectively alleviated by equipping with the proposed SGCE module, and the CycleGAN equipped with SGCE outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of four important evaluation metrics and visualization quality. Besides CycleGAN, we also show that the suggested SGCE module can be adapted to other models for Chinese font generation as a plug-and-play module to further improve their performance.",

The proposed method addresses limitations in conventional GAN, particularly in capturing the intricate patterns, textures, and cultural elements inherent in traditional batik art. The Batik Nitik Sarimbit 120 dataset, comprising 120 images across 60 classes, serves as the foundation for training and evaluation, enriched with augmentation techniques to ensure robust learning. The multi discriminator framework enables comprehensive evaluation of synthetic motifs by focusing on distinct aspects such as global patterns, local details, and traditional elements, providing the generator with diverse and detailed feedback. Simultaneously, the self-attention layer allows the generator to dynamically prioritize critical motif elements, ensuring the preservation of spatial relationships and overall harmony in the patterns. Quantitative evaluation using FID, PSNR, and SSIM metrics demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over the baseline Batik GAN SL and other tested variations. The proposed method achieved a significant reduction in FID, PSNR, and SSIM score. These results indicate enhanced visual fidelity, structural consistency, and noise reduction in the generated motifs. The findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating multi discriminator and self-attention mechanisms in Batik GAN, enabling the synthesis of realistic and culturally authentic batik motifs.

    abstract = "Recently, unsupervised learning has made impressive progress on various tasks. Despite the dominance of discriminative models, increasing attention is drawn to representations learned by generative models and in particular, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Previous works on the interpretation of GANs reveal that GANs encode semantics in feature maps in a linearly separable form. In this work, we further find that GAN's features can be well clustered with the linear separability assumption. We propose a novel clustering algorithm, named KLiSH, which leverages the linear separability to cluster GAN's features. KLiSH succeeds in extracting fine-grained semantics of GANs trained on datasets of various objects, e.g., car, portrait, animals, and so on. With KLiSH, we can sample images from GANs along with their segmentation masks and synthesize paired image-segmentation datasets. Using the synthesized datasets, we enable two downstream applications. First, we train semantic segmentation networks on these datasets and test them on real images, realizing unsupervised semantic segmentation. Second, we train image-to-image translation networks on the synthesized datasets, enabling semantic-conditional image synthesis without human annotations.",

While evocative, narrative-rich quests are still mostly hand-authored, player demands toward more and richer game content, as well as business requirements for continuous player engagement necessitate alternative, procedural quest generation methods. While existing methods produce mostly uninteresting, mechanical quest descriptions, recent advances in AI have brought forth generative language models with promising computational storytelling capabilities. We leverage two of the most successful transformer models, 1) GPT-2 and 2) GPT-3, to procedurally generate RPG video game quest descriptions. We gathered, processed, and openly published a dataset of 978 quests and their descriptions from six RPGs. We fine-tuned GPT-2 on this dataset with a range of optimizations informed by several ministudies. We validated the resulting Quest-GPT-2 model via an online user study involving 349 RPG players. Our results indicate that one in five quest descriptions would be deemed acceptable by a human critic, yet the variation in quality across individual quests is large. We provide recommendations on current applications of Quest-GPT-2. This is complemented by case-studies on GPT-3 to highlight the future potential of state-of-the-art natural language models for quest generation.",

In education, a persistent technological gap often puts teachers at a disadvantage, trailing behind students who are more adept at embracing new technologies. The SETCOM project successfully introduced AI to both students and teachers, particularly focusing on educational study program students destined to become teachers themselves. Despite generational disparities between teachers and students, with younger generations showing more inclination towards ICT and AI, utilization remains sporadic. While students readily embrace AI, subscription-based advanced AI systems see surprising uptake, with around a fifth of students utilizing them. Primarily, students use AI to comprehend unfamiliar concepts, acknowledging its capacity to generate responses but exercising caution by verifying and correcting errors in over half of cases. For teachers, embracing AI becomes crucial to remain relevant in their field, despite potential financial implications. Failure to adapt risks being perceived as outdated by their students across all educational levels. In summary, generative AI systems are entrenched in education, offering both opportunities and challenges. Bridging the technological gap is imperative for teachers, as students increasingly rely on AI for learning support. Embracing AI becomes essential for educators to maintain relevance and effectiveness in teaching, ensuring they do not become obsolete in the eyes of their tech-savvy pupils.",

However, existing researches in smart education face challenges in cross-disciplinary communication, making it difficult to accurately simulate the language styles and thinking patterns of students from different disciplinary backgrounds. This leads to limited semantic transfer ability and weak knowledge integration capabilities, thereby limiting their effectiveness in multidisciplinary contexts. To address this issue, this study introduces the generative agent model driven by large language models (LLMs), based on Qwen-Max, to simulate interactions between humanities and science learners. Six metrics are designed to quantify and evaluate the quality of communication. Experimental results show that cross-disciplinary communication has lower information redundancy and stronger language adaptability compared to intra-disciplinary communication. The memory mechanism is introduced to improve communication coherence and knowledge integration. This research provides empirical support for the application of agents in cross-disciplinary collaboration and offers new directions for the development of smart education systems.",

In this work, we propose a framework called InterFaceGAN to interpret the disentangled face representation learned by the state-of-the-art GAN models and study the properties of the facial semantics encoded in the latent space. We first find that GANs learn various semantics in some linear subspaces of the latent space. After identifying these subspaces, we can realistically manipulate the corresponding facial attributes without retraining the model. We then conduct a detailed study on the correlation between different semantics and manage to better disentangle them via subspace projection, resulting in more precise control of the attribute manipulation. Besides manipulating the gender, age, expression, and presence of eyeglasses, we can even alter the face pose and fix the artifacts accidentally made by GANs. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth face identity analysis and a layer-wise analysis to evaluate the editing results quantitatively. Finally, we apply our approach to real face editing by employing GAN inversion approaches and explicitly training feed-forward models based on the synthetic data established by InterFaceGAN. Extensive experimental results suggest that learning to synthesize faces spontaneously brings a disentangled and controllable face representation.",

In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based formulation for VSR. We introduce a new generator network optimized for the VSR problem, named VSRResNet, along with new discriminator architecture to properly guide VSRResNet during the GAN training. We further enhance our VSR GAN formulation with two regularizers, a distance loss in feature-space and pixel-space, to obtain our final VSRResFeatGAN model. We show that pre-training our generator with the mean-squared-error loss only quantitatively surpasses the current state-of-the-art VSR models. Finally, we employ the PercepDist metric to compare the state-of-the-art VSR models. We show that this metric more accurately evaluates the perceptual quality of SR solutions obtained from neural networks, compared with the commonly used PSNR/SSIM metrics.

    abstract = "Anomaly detection has become an indispensable tool for modern society, applied in a wide range of applications, from detecting fraudulent transactions to malignant brain tumors. Over time, many anomaly detection techniques have been introduced. However, in general, they all suffer from the same problem: lack of data that represents anomalous behaviour. As anomalous behaviour is usually costly (or dangerous) for a system, it is difficult to gather enough data that represents such behaviour. This, in turn, makes it difficult to develop and evaluate anomaly detection techniques. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have attracted much attention in anomaly detection research, due to their unique ability to generate new data. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the literature in this area, covering 128 papers. The goal of this review paper is to analyze the relation between anomaly detection techniques and types of GANs, to identify the most common application domains for GAN-assisted and GAN-based anomaly detection, and to assemble information on datasets and performance metrics used to assess them. Our study helps researchers and practitioners to find the most suitable GAN-assisted anomaly detection technique for their application. In addition, we present a research roadmap for future studies in this area. In summary, GANs are used in anomaly detection to address the problem of insufficient amount of data for the anomalous behaviour, either through data augmentation or representation learning. The most commonly used GAN architectures are DCGANs, standard GANs, and cGANs. The primary application domains include medicine, surveillance and intrusion detection.",

    abstract = "In the pursuit of promoting green energy, efficient defect inspection in solar cell manufacturing is crucial in enhancing the reliability of solar energy systems. However, traditional deep learning models for automatic defect inspection in photovoltaic (PV) cell electroluminescence (EL) images encounter challenges in industrial settings due to difficulties associated with data acquisition, imbalance, and variability of defects. This paper presents a novel Multi-Scale Attention Generative Adversarial Network (MAGAN), an innovative GAN-based framework specifically designed for data augmentation in the context of solar cell defect detection. When integrated with automated detection techniques, MAGAN markedly improves the accuracy and efficiency of current models. A method for augmenting image datasets of EL was developed to generate a sufficient quantity of images for training machine learning models, addressing sample scarcity and bolstering CNN-based defect classification accuracy. The core of this approach lies in the application of the MCA (Multi-channel Spatial Attention Mechanism) and GLSA (Gate-like Spatial Attention Mechanism) modules, which enhance feature extraction by leveraging channel attention and spatial attention, respectively, thereby reflecting the most recent advancements in attention mechanism technology. The MCA dissects channels into sub-features across various scales, ensuring detailed attention mapping, whereas the GLSA refines spatial cues with a gating mechanism, shedding computational inefficiencies. The effectiveness of this approach is validated by comprehensive experiments against state-of-the-art deep learning models. The experiments demonstrate the exceptional performance of MAGAN, achieving a low FID score of 141.98 and KID score of 0.106 on complex EL images, surpassing previous models and emphasizing data augmentation‚Äôs importance in defect detection. With an industry-leading detection accuracy of 87.3\%, this study makes a substantial contribution to mitigating data imbalance. This method enhances quality control in solar cell manufacturing.

    abstract = "Domain adaptation techniques learn transferable knowledge from a source domain to a target domain and train models that generalize well in the target domain. Unfortunately, a majority of the existing techniques are only applicable to scenarios that the target-domain data in the task of interest is available for training, yet this is not often true in practice. In general, human beings are experts in generalization across domains. For example, a baby can easily identify the bear from a clipart image after learning this category of animal from the photo images. To reduce the gap between the generalization ability of human and that of machines, we propose a new solution to the challenging zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA) problem, where only a single source domain is available and the target domain for the task of interest is not accessible. Inspired by the observation that the knowledge about domain correlation can improve our generalization ability, we explore the correlation between source domain and target domain in an irrelevant knowledge task ($ \mathbb {K}$K-task), where dual-domain samples are available. We denote the task of interest as the question task ($ \mathbb {Q}$Q-task) and synthesize its non-accessible target-domain as such that these two tasks have the shared domain correlation. In order to realize our idea, we introduce a new network structure, i.e., conditional coupled generative adversarial networks (CoCoGAN), by extending the coupled generative adversarial networks (CoGAN) into a conditioning model. With a pair of coupling GANs, our CoCoGAN is able to capture the joint distribution of data samples across two domains and two tasks. For CoCoGAN training in a ZSDA task, we introduce three supervisory signals, i.e., semantic relationship consistency across domains, global representation alignment across tasks, and alignment consistency across domains. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can learn a suitable model for the non-accessible target domain and outperforms the existing state of the arts in both image classification and semantic segmentation.",

Most such frameworks need a large amount of annotated training data, which are expensive. Moreover, machines still lack human intelligence, as illustrated by the fact that they pay less attention to the interesting regions that humans generally focus on when searching for images. Hence, this paper proposes a novel unsupervised framework that focuses on the instance object in the image and integrates human intelligence into the deep-learning-based image retrieval. This framework is called adversarial instance-level image retrieval (AILIR). We incorporate adversarial training and an attention mechanism into this framework that considers human intelligence with artificial intelligence. The generator and discriminator are redesigned to guarantee that the generator retrieves similar images while the discriminator selects unmatched images and creates an adversarial reward for the generator. A minimax game is conducted by the adversarial reward retrieval mechanism until the discriminator is unable to judge whether the image sequence retrieved matches the query. Comparison and ablation experiments on four benchmark datasets prove that the proposed adversarial training framework indeed improves instance retrieval and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods focused on instance retrieval.",

Because of this, our work explores state-of-the-art (SOTA) ITS approaches with the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve programming education. We investigate whether and how a GenAI-based ITS can effectively support students in learning R programming skills. We measured the performance of three current pairings of LLMs and user interfaces: GPT-3.5 via ChatGPT, PaLM 2 via Google Bard, and GPT-4 via Bing. Therefore, we evaluated the LLMs on four types of problem settings when learning/teaching programming. Our experimental results show that the use of generative AI, specifically LLMs for R programming, is promising, where GPT-3.5 yielded the most satisfactory results. Furthermore, the advantages and limitations of our approach are addressed and revealed. Finally, open research directions towards explainable AI (XAI) and integrated self-assessment are pointed out.",

We propose a framework based on generative adversarial networks that uses tools from formal methods, namely signal temporal logic and syntax trees. This allows us to leverage information on rule obedience as features in neural networks and improves prediction accuracy without biasing towards lawful behavior.

The problems associated with obtaining a dataset suitable for neural network modeling are considered. Methods are described that make it possible to bring this set to a form suitable for training and further use in neural network modeling. A software module-data loader has been designed and implemented, which allows converting a three-dimensional model into a numpy array of a depth map with subsequent use as a training set. For the preprocessing of the original images, the authors used a wide range of methods, including dimensionality reduction, noise suppression (Gaussian filter).

    abstract = "The rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence, including Large Language Models (LLMs), has enabled users to engage in self-guided learning of sports skills through conversation-based interactions. However, studies have identified a phenomenon known as ‚Äúhallucination‚Äù in which LLMs generate feedback that is inaccurate or non-existent. While this phenomenon has been observed in various domains, including medicine, academia, and news, its existence and implications in the context of physical exercises, particularly motor skill learning, remain unexplored. This study investigates the presence of LLM hallucinations in badminton skill learning and examines their potential impact on learning outcomes. This study aims to investigate whether LLMs hallucinations exist in the motor skill learning of physical exercises and what impact they may have. Eighty university freshmen with no prior badminton experience participated in a 16-week experiment, with 40 students assigned to the Experimental Group (EG) utilizing LLM-based applications (ChatGPT or New Bing) for self-guided learning, and 40 students in the Control Group (CG) learning under the supervision of 12 university sports teachers and 8 experts that specialized in badminton. Evaluation criteria for badminton skills were established, and assessments were conducted at baseline and 16 weeks using independent sample t-tests and paired-sample t-tests. One-way analysis of variance (One-Way ANCOVA) was employed to compare learning outcomes between the two groups. Interviews were conducted to gain insights into the causes of any observed differences in learning efficiency. Both CG and EG groups demonstrated motor skill improvement (clear: p <0.001; smash: p <0.001; footwork: p <0.001). CG exhibited significantly higher scores in long-distance shots and smashes in the post-test. No significant difference was observed in footwork scores between the two groups. High accordance in specific skill points among students in both groups indicated the common usage of prompts. Interviews with EG students revealed hallucinations in the text generated by LLMs, particularly in the context of ‚Äúforearm internal rotation swing.‚Äù LLMs exhibit hallucinations in the context of intricate motor skill learning, such as badminton, where limited corpus data is available. These hallucinations can mislead users and impact learning outcomes. Future research should explore strategies to mitigate LLM hallucinations in physical exercise learning applications.",

    abstract = "Unsupervised anomaly detection methods can identify surface defects in industrial images by leveraging only normal samples for training. Due to the risk of overfitting when learning from a single class, anomaly synthesis strategies are introduced to enhance detection capability by generating artificial anomalies. However, existing strategies heavily rely on anomalous textures from auxiliary datasets. Moreover, their limitations in the coverage and directionality of anomaly synthesis may result in a failure to capture useful information and lead to significant redundancy. To address these issues, we propose a novel Progressive Boundary-guided Anomaly Synthesis (PBAS) strategy, which can directionally synthesize crucial feature-level anomalies without auxiliary textures. It consists of three core components: Approximate Boundary Learning (ABL), Anomaly Feature Synthesis (AFS), and Refined Boundary Optimization (RBO). To make the distribution of normal samples more compact, ABL first learns an approximate decision boundary by center constraint, which improves the center initialization through feature alignment. AFS then directionally synthesizes anomalies with more flexible scales guided by the hypersphere distribution of normal features. Since the boundary is so loose that it may contain real anomalies, RBO refines the decision boundary through the binary classification of artificial anomalies and normal features. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and the fastest detection speed on three widely used industrial datasets, including MVTec AD, VisA, and MPDD. The code will be available at: https://github.com/cqylunlun/PBAS.",

We base our research on a molecular generative adversarial network (MolGAN) architecture to investigate how the validity score is influenced in different scenarios. First, we verify that the Vanilla GAN structure can produce valid molecules in measure, and that the reward network, along with Vanilla GAN, can further increase the validity score in a reinforcement learning manner. Then, the procedure for solely optimizing the validity score is tested, followed by an assessment of validity score maintenance while other chemical properties are being optimized. We found that multiple aspects, including loss functions, hyper parameters, and training sequences, must be carefully considered and optimized to raise the validity score of molecular generation alone or in concurrence with the optimizing of other chemical property scores.",

A probabilistic formulation of such models with stochastic latent variables can obtain an interpretable and legible reasoning system with less supervision. However, it is still nontrivial to generate reasonable symbolic structures without the guidance of domain knowledge, since it generally involves an optimization problem with both continuous and discrete variables. Despite the challenges, the interpretability of such symbolic structures provides an interface to regularize their generation by domain knowledge. In this article, we propose to incorporate the available domain knowledge into the learning process of probabilistic neural‚Äìsymbolic (PNS) models via posterior constraints that directly regularize the structure posterior. In this way, our model is able to identify a middle point where the structure generation process mainly learns from data but also selectively borrows information from domain knowledge. We further present inductive reasoning where the posterior constraints can be automatically reweighted to handle noisy annotations. The experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on major abstract reasoning datasets and enjoys good generalization capability and data efficiency.",

Recently, deep learning based methods have been proposed to enhance low light images by penalizing the pixel-wise loss of low light and normal light images. However, most of them suffer from the following problems: 1) the need of pairs of low light and normal light images for training, 2) the poor performance for dark images, 3) the amplification of noise. To alleviate these problems, in this letter, we propose a two-stage unsupervised method that decomposes the low light image enhancement into a pre-enhancement and a post-refinement problem. In the first stage, we pre-enhance a low light image with a conventional Retinex based method. In the second stage, we use a refinement network learned with adversarial training for further improvement of the image quality. The experimental results show that our method outperforms previous methods on four benchmark datasets.

This study employed a mixed-methods approach to comprehensively appraise Chinese students‚Äô attitudes toward AI painting technology and the reasons behind these viewpoints. Data was collected from five universities and three high schools in China through questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews. Quantitative analysis demonstrated clear trends in students‚Äô attitudes toward AI painting technology, with gender, educational level, and background in art and design identified as significant influencing factors. Specifically, students with higher levels of education demonstrated more favorable attitudes toward AI painting technology. This was evidenced by a strong positive correlation coefficient of 0.644 (p<0.01) between educational attainment and positive perceptions of this technology; whereas, a negative correlation with gender (coefficient of ‚àí0.263, p<0.01) indicated a difference in attitudes between male and female students, with males displaying more positive views. Specifically, background in art and design did not appear to significantly affect students‚Äô attitudes, as presented by an insignificant correlation coefficient of ‚àí0.048 (p>0.05). In addition, regression analysis, with an R2 value of 0.419, suggests that these variables can account for 41.9\% of the variance in student attitudes toward AI painting, emphasizing the significant effect of gender and education level on their perspectives. Qualitative findings further indicated that concerns about copyright ethics, job displacement anxieties, personal values and aesthetic viewpoints, and broader social and environmental implications all affected students‚Äô attitudes toward AI painting technology.

    abstract = "The field of conditional Electrocardiogram(ECG) generation focuses on generating specified ECGs under given conditions for medical purposes. Existing methods are typically based on conditions of simple inputs like text or lead types. However, they struggle to handle the complexity of radar heart sound signals due to the lack of effective feature extraction, which hinders capturing the intricate waveform correlations between radar heart sounds and ECGs. Considering that radar-detected heart sound signals are contactless, the application is of essential value in a real-world deployment like sleep scenarios. Moreover, no prior approaches have addressed this specific task. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel multi-scale feature fusion network framework, Radar2ECG. This model leverages pre-trained autoencoders for heart sound and ECG signals, aligning and integrating multi-layer features through a bottleneck structure to enhance receptive fields and reduce redundant features, thereby capturing the correlations between heart sounds and ECGs. Finally, we employ knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from the ECG decoder to the heart sound decoder. We present three anomaly type datasets and extensive experiments conducted on both normal and abnormal datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models in both accuracy and robustness. The multi-scale feature fusion significantly improves performance, showcasing strong potential in ECG generation and heart sound anomaly detection tasks.",

The joint training of front-end speech enhancement (SE) and speech recognition system becomes a popular solution to the noise-robust ASR. However, the speech distortion problem arisen due to excessive information suppression by the SE module. To address this issue, in this paper, a novel dual-branch SE (DBSE) module is proposed as the front-end of the ASR system for joint training. Particularly, the two branches extract the clean speeches using different ways: one branch directly extracts clean speeches and the other branch utilizes spectral subtraction method. The final denoising speech signals are obtained by combining the outputs from both branches. In this way, the oversuppressed information can be compensated from each other. The two-stage joint training strategy is adopted for the noise-robust ASR model where the proposed DBSE is first pretrained by multitask reconstruction loss, and then the DBSE and ASR model is jointly trained using the speech recognition based loss function. Comparisons with several state-of-the-art ASR algorithms on benchmark dataset are conducted, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithm.",

Furthermore, existing event extraction studies have primarily focused on domains such as news, finance, and biomedicine, with limited application in the field of safety production. To address these challenges, this paper divides the event extraction task into two phases tailored to the characteristics of the safety production domain: event triple extraction and event classification. This approach achieves the extraction of essential event information and the categorization of event types through a phase-based extraction method. By extracting event triples based on dependent syntactic analysis and semantic role annotation, we can successfully match 84.64\% of events according to the template and structure the event representations. Subsequently, the event classification task is performed on the event triples using the ELECTRA\_TextRCNN model. In comparison to the TextRCNN model, our proposed ELECTRA\_TextRCNN model demonstrates a 9\% improvement in accuracy and a 7\% increase in F1 value. Ultimately, we have significantly enhanced the accuracy of event extraction in the safety domain through a two-stage approach.",

Most underwater image restoration methods are confined to the pixel space of the raw modality, overlooking the important role of other modalities and different frequency-domain features. As a result, the representational capacity of deep learning models is not fully realized, affecting the generation of high-quality images. To address the above issues, we propose Multi-modal Visual Guidance and Feature Decomposition (MVG-FD) method for underwater image restoration. Specifically, we introduce Modality Visual Guidance (MVG) module, which integrates the complementary information provided by depth modality features into the raw features to guide the model in restoring the color of underwater images. Meanwhile, we design Feature Decomposition (FD) module, which utilizes Learnable Wavelet Decomposition (LWD) to decompose and extract the high-frequency bands of the raw features to help restore the texture details of the image. MVG-FD significantly improves PSNR and SSIM on existing datasets. The code is available at: https://github.com/zhangao668/MVG-FD.",

Identifying human-written comments and tweets amidst AI-generated ones is critical for mitigating such challenges. This paper proposes a method for detecting AI-generated comment by fine-tuning a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for classification tasks. The BERT model is fine-tuned on a custom AI text classification dataset, incorporating a neural network classification head to distinguish between machine-generated text (MGT) and human-written text (HWT). A custom dataset of YouTube comments, consisting of both human-written and AI-generated comments, is constructed to evaluate the model's performance in real-world social media scenarios. The model is fine-tuned on this dataset to detect AI-generated comments in social media discussions. To further analyze the discriminative capabilities of the model, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to visualize the embeddings. The results indicate that the fine-tuned BERT model effectively captures semantic patterns and separates AI comments and human comments into distinct regions in the embedding space, with a clear decision boundary between the two classes. This approach demonstrates the potential of fine-tuned transformer-based models for detecting AI-generated text and offers a robust solution to countering AI-driven misinformation on social media platforms.",

To address these challenges, data augmentation techniques employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have been extensively explored, with diffusion models particularly noted for their ability to enhance data diversity and quality. Despite their achievements, it remains a challenging task to generate a diverse range of samples from limited datasets and to achieve precise generation of images that align with user intentions.To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework, EDM (Enhancing Quality Diversity of Medical image augmentation under the user-specified complex and various conditions), designed to generate diverse high-quality medical images under the various and complex multimodal conditions, representing age, sex, and diseases. Our framework comprises four steps. First, we propose a metric to quantize the necessity of data augmentation. Second, we prepare data augmentation. We generate medical sketch-image-text triplets using DiffSketcher from the real patients‚Äô dataset. Then we employ these triplets to train ControlNet, enabling the generation of synthetic medical images from sketch data. Third, we generate synthetic medical images. We obtain multiple sketches for each image from a diversity-enhanced DiffSketcher, incorporating similarity loss. Using these sketches, we augment data from the fine-tuned ControlNet from the second step. Lastly, we introduce a metric to measure the diversity of the generated images, ensuring the effectiveness of our augmentation process.Our preliminary experimental results imply EDM can be the promising solution.

This technology offers personalized services to consumers and has garnered considerable attention for its potential business value. However, current methods are unable to deform clothing images to align with the human body naturally. Additionally, the generation of low-quality monocular try-on images severely hinders the creation of high-precision human models. This paper presents a novel monocular-to-3D human modeling network capable of accurately generating 3D models from monocular try-on images. To improve the accuracy of clothing deformation, an enhanced non-rigid deformation constraint strategy is introduced. This strategy helps reduce excessive deformation by strengthening penalties for outliers. Additionally, occlusion is addressed by implementing strict boundary constraints, resulting in more realistic and natural deformation outcomes. Furthermore, a stepped spatial-aware block is proposed to fuse latent multi-scale shape features in person images during depth estimation. This approach allows for creating high-precision person models in a single stage, enhancing the overall quality of the generated 3D models.

Using low-level cues, objects are tracked in each of the camera views independently, and the positions and velocities of objects along trajectories are computed as features. Under a generative model, our approach jointly learns the distribution of an activity in the feature spaces of different camera views. It accomplishes two tasks: (1) grouping trajectories in different camera views belonging to the same activity into one cluster; (2) modeling paths commonly taken by objects across camera views. To our knowledge, no prior result of co-clustering trajectories in multiple camera views has been published. Advantages of this approach are that it does not require first solving the challenging correspondence problem, and the learning is unsupervised. Our approach is evaluated on two very large data sets with 22, 951 and 14, 985 trajectories.",

We propose a probabilistic framework for incorporating global dynamics knowledge into the local feature extraction processes. A global tracking algorithm can be formulated as a generative model and used to predict feature values that are incorporated into an observation process of the feature extractor.

At the next level, we define a prior over the sets of activation variables in all subjects. We use a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process as the prior in order to simultaneously learn the patterns of response that are shared across the group, and to estimate the number of these patterns supported by data. Inference based on this model enables automatic discovery and characterization of salient and consistent patterns in functional signals. We apply our method to data from a study that explores the response of the visual cortex to a collection of images. The discovered profiles of activation correspond to selectivity to a number of image categories such as faces, bodies, and scenes. More generally, our results appear superior to the results of alternative data-driven methods in capturing the category structure in the space of stimuli.",

    abstract = "Artificial Intelligence (AI) development has encouraged many new research areas, including AI-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) network. AI analytics and intelligent paradigms greatly improve learning efficiency and accuracy. Applying these learning paradigms to network scenarios provide technical advantages of new networking solutions. In this paper, we propose an improved approach for IoT security from data perspective. The network traffic of IoT devices can be analyzed using AI techniques. The Adversary Learning (AdLIoTLog) model is proposed using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with attention mechanism on sequences of network events in the network traffic. We define network events as a sequence of the time series packets of protocols captured in the log. We have considered different packets TCP packets, UDP packets, and HTTP packets in the network log to make the algorithm robust. The distributed IoT devices can collaborate to cripple our world which is extending to Internet of Intelligence. The time series packets are converted into structured data by removing noise and adding timestamps. The resulting data set is trained by RNN and can detect the node pairs collaborating with each other. We used the BLEU score to evaluate the model performance. Our results show that the predicting performance of the AdLIoTLog model trained by our method degrades by 3-4\% in the presence of attack in comparison to the scenario when the network is not under attack. AdLIoTLog can detect adversaries because when adversaries are present the model gets duped by the collaborative events and therefore predicts the next event with a biased event rather than a benign event. We conclude that AI can provision ubiquitous learning for the new generation of Internet of Things.",

    abstract = "Vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong general capabilities and achieved great success in areas such as image understanding and reasoning. Visual prompts enhance the focus of VLMs on designated areas, but their fine-grained grounding has not been fully developed. Recent research has used Set-of-Mark (SoM) approach to unleash the grounding capabilities of Generative Pre-trained Transformer-4 with Vision (GPT-4V), achieving significant benchmark performance. However, SoM still has problems with label offset and hallucination of vision language models, and the grounding ability of VLMs remains limited, making it challenging to handle complex scenarios in human-robot interaction. To address these limitations and provide more accurate and less hallucinatory results, we propose Contextual Set-of-Mark (ConSoM), a new SoM-based prompting mechanism that leverages dual-image inputs and contextual semantic information of images. Experiments demonstrate that ConSoM has distinct advantages in visual grounding, improving by 11\% compared to the baseline on the dataset Refcocog. Furthermore, we evaluated ConSoM‚Äôs grounding abilities in five indoor scenarios, where it exhibited strong robustness in complex environments and under occlusion conditions. We also introduced a scalable annotation method for pixel-level question-answering dataset. The accuracy, scalability, and depth of world knowledge make ConSoM a highly effective approach for future human-robot interactions.",

However, the evaluation of LLMs in this specialized area remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we introduce the Test and Measurement Intelligence Quotient (TMIQ), a benchmark designed to quantitatively assess LLMs across a wide range of electronic engineering tasks. TMIQ offers a comprehensive set of scenarios and metrics for detailed evaluation, including SCPI command matching accuracy, ranked response evaluation, Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (CoT), and the impact of output formatting variations required by LLMs on performance. In testing various LLMs, our findings indicate varying levels of proficiency, with exact SCPI command match accuracy ranging from around 56\% to 73\%, and ranked matching first-position scores achieving around 33\% for the best-performing model. We also assess token usage, cost-efficiency, and response times, identifying trade-offs between accuracy and operational efficiency. Additionally, we present a command-line interface (CLI) tool that enables users to generate datasets using the same methodology, allowing for tailored assessments of LLMs. TMIQ and the CLI tool provide a rigorous, reproducible means of evaluating LLMs for production environments, facilitating continuous monitoring and identifying strengths and areas for improvement, and driving innovation in their selections for applications within the Test and Measurement industry.",

These approaches can generate images with general shape and color but often produce distorted global structures with unnatural local semantic details. It is due to ineffectiveness of convolutional neural networks in capturing the high-level semantic information for pixel-level image synthesis. In this paper, we propose a Dual Attentional Generative Adversarial Network (DualAttn-GAN) in which the dual attention modules are introduced to enhance local details and global structures by attending to related features from relevant words and different visual regions. As one of the dual modules, the textual attention module is designed to explore the fine-grained interaction between vision and language. On the other hand, visual attention module models internal representations of vision from channel and spatial axes, which can better capture the global structures. Meanwhile, we apply an attention embedding module to merge multi-path features. Furthermore, we present an inverted residual structure to boost representation power of CNNs and apply spectral normalization to stabilize GAN training. With extensive experimental validation on two benchmark datasets, our method significantly improves state-of-the-art models over the evaluation metrics of inception score and Fr√©chet inception distance.",

For removing snowflakes from a single image, we proposed a composition generative adversarial network. Different from the previous generative adversarial networks, our generator network comprises clean background module and a snow mask estimate module. The clean background module aims to generate a clear image from an input snowy image, and snow mask estimate module is used to produce the snow mask in an input image. During the training step, we put forward a composition loss between the input snowy image and composition of the generated clean image and estimated snow mask. We use a dataset named Snow100K2 including indoor and outdoor scenes to train and test the proposed method.

Although machine learning and deep learning are widely used in credit card fraud detection, the typical credit card transaction data set is unbalanced, and the fraud data is much less than the normal transaction data, limiting the effectiveness of traditional binary classification algorithms. To overcome this issue, researchers oversample minority class data and utilize ensemble learning classification algorithms. However, oversampling still has disadvantages. Hence, we improve the generator part of the Variational Autoencoder Generative Adversarial Network (VAEGAN) and propose a new oversampling method that generates convincing and diverse minority class data. The training set is enhanced by generating minority class fraud data to train the ensemble learning classification model. The method is tested on an open credit card dataset, with the experimental results demonstrating that the oversampling method utilizing the improved VAEGAN is superior to the oversampling method of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) in terms of Precision, F1\_score, and other indicators. The oversampling method based on the improved VAEGAN effectively deals with the classification problem of imbalanced data.",

    abstract = "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are used for image enhancement such as single image super-resolution (SISR) and deblurring. The conventional GANs-based image enhancement suffers from two drawbacks that cause a quality degradation due to a loss of detailed information. First, the conventional discriminator network adopts strided convolution layers which cause a reduction in the resolution of the feature map, and thereby resulting in a loss of detailed information. Second, the previous GANs for image enhancement use the feature map of the visual geometry group (VGG) network for generating a content loss, which also causes visual artifacts because the maxpooling layers in the VGG network result in a loss of detailed information. To overcome these two drawbacks, this paper presents a proposal of a new resolution-preserving discriminator network architecture which removes the strided convolution layers, and a new content loss generated from the VGG network without maxpooling layers. The proposed discriminator network is applied to the super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN), which is called a resolution-preserving SRGAN (RPSRGAN). Experimental results show that RPSRGAN generates more realistic super-resolution images than SRGAN does, and consequently, RPSRGAN with the new content loss improves the average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by 0.75 dB and 0.32 dB for super-resolution images with the scale factors of 2 and 4, respectively. For deblurring, the visual appearance is also significantly improved, and the average PSNR is increased by 1.54 dB when the proposed discriminator and content loss are applied to the deblurring adversarial network.",

We propose an auto-encoder as a generator, which incorporates dense residual networks and self-attention. Moreover, we propose a new discriminator, which introduces self-attention on the basis of a relativistic discriminator. To predict a future frame with higher quality for normal events, we impose a constraint on the motion in video prediction by fusing optical flow and gradient difference between frames. We also introduce a perception constraint in video prediction to enrich the texture details of a frame. The AUC of our method on CUHK Avenue and Shanghai Tech datasets reaches 89.2\% and 75.7\% respectively, which is better than most existing methods. In addition, we propose a processing flow that can realize real-time anomaly detection in videos. The average running time of our video prediction framework is 37 frames per second.

    abstract = "High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences, such as 3D turbo or fast spin-echo (TSE/FSE) imaging, are clinically desirable but suffer from long scanning time-related blurring when reformatted into preferred orientations. Instead, multi-slice two-dimensional (2D) TSE imaging is commonly used because of its high in-plane resolution but is limited clinically by poor through-plane resolution due to elongated voxels and the inability to generate multi-planar reformations due to staircase artifacts. Therefore, multiple 2D TSE scans are acquired in various orthogonal imaging planes, increasing the overall MRI scan time. In this study, we propose a novel slice-profile transformation super-resolution (SPTSR) framework with deep generative learning for through-plane super-resolution (SR) of multi-slice 2D TSE imaging. The deep generative networks were trained by synthesized low-resolution training input via slice-profile downsampling (SP-DS), and the trained networks inferred on the slice profile convolved (SP-conv) testing input for 5.5x through-plane SR. The network output was further slice-profile deconvolved (SP-deconv) to achieve an isotropic super-resolution. Compared to SMORE SR method and the networks trained by conventional downsampling, our SPTSR framework demonstrated the best overall image quality from 50 testing cases, evaluated by two abdominal radiologists. The quantitative analysis cross-validated the expert reader study results. 3D simulation experiments confirmed the quantitative improvement of the proposed SPTSR and the effectiveness of the SP-deconv step, compared to 3D ground-truths. Ablation studies were conducted on the individual contributions of SP-DS and SP-conv, networks structure, training dataset size, and different slice profiles.",

    abstract = "Image inpainting techniques have been greatly improved by relying on structure and texture priors. However, damaged original images or rough predictions cannot provide sufficient texture information and accurate structural priors, leading to a drop in image quality. Moreover, from the perspective of human visual perception, it is important to pay attention to facial symmetry and facial attribute consistency. In this paper, we present a face inpainting system with iteration structure, guided by generative facial priors contained in pretrained GANs and predicted semantic information. Specifically, generative facial priors generated by the GAN inversion techniques introduce sufficient textures and features to assist inpainting; semantic maps are able to provide facial structural information and semantic categories of different pixels for face reconstruction. In particular, we iteratively refine images multiple times, updating semantic maps at each iteration. The Weighted Prior-Guidance Modulation layer (WPGM) is devised for incorporating priors into networks through spatial modulation. We also propose facial feature self-symmetry loss to constrain the symmetry of faces in feature space. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LaPa datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model for facial detail and attribute consistency. Meanwhile, under the background of COVID-19, it is worth trying recognition via inpainting to deal with recognition challenges brought by mask occlusion. Relevant experiments show that our inpainting model does help to recognition tasks to a certain degree, with higher accuracy.",

Accurately detecting such graph anomalies using deep learning approaches faces challenges in terms of obtaining sufficient labelled data, as well as an imbalance between normal and anomalous instances. These contribute to model bias or over-fitting problems and inferior anomaly detection outcomes. In order to address these challenges in graphs, we propose a novel generative framework, called LabelGen, that can generate additional anomalous labels, in terms of graph objects, such as nodes, through augmentation and provide updated deep embedding for the graph concurrently. In particular, we propose the use of a k-hop neighborhood sampling strategy, an anomaly scoring mechanism and an adversarial learning framework with a generator and discriminator pair in order to generate sufficient and informative anomalous nodes that closely resemble the characteristics of existing anomalies in the graph. Evaluation on benchmark network datasets, as well as ablation and comparison studies with random label generation processes and other existing works reveal that the proposed generative framework is superior in improving the anomaly detection accuracy in graphs, while achieving a balanced trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.",

Aiming at the problems of difficult screening of multi-source common sensitive features, the challenging training of neural networks with a small number of sensitive features, and the difficulty of directly using generative adversarial networks for early fault warning, this paper constructs an early fault warning model based on multi-source common sensitive features and an improved Wasserstein generative adversarial network, proposing an early fault warning method for rotating machinery. The model was verified by using the open XJTU-SY bearing laboratory data, the P3409A centrifugal pump bearing fault engineering case data of a petrochemical company and the rotor system engineering case data of a circulating hydrogen centrifugal compressor of a petrochemical company. The early fault warning method of rotating machinery proposed in this paper warns the bearing fault of centrifugal pump 160 hours in advance and the rotor system fault of centrifugal compressor 1330 minutes in advance. Compared with the two published methods, the proposed method has better early fault warning effect, better normal and abnormal health index discrimination and less false warning.",

In spite of recent efforts in this field, how to learn fine-shape preserving features, such as object boundaries and contours, is still an open issue. In this work, we propose a progressive learning network to estimate height information from single aerial images in a coarse-to-fine manner. In particular, a gated feature aggregation module is introduced to effectively combine low-level and high-level features. The proposed method is validated on three public datasets, including the Vaihingen dataset, the Potsdam dataset, and the DFC2019 dataset. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more accurate height estimation from single aerial images, especially with better object boundary and contour preserving capability, than four related height estimation methods.",

To support AIGC metaverse applications within MEC in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, it is effective to offload computation tasks, particularly those involving neural networks generative in AIGC, from mobile devices to edge clouds. Existing solutions typically assume the availability of a dedicated and powerful edge server for each user with single modal data, which can handle the entire AIGC service offloading. However, the practical availability of such dedicated and powerful servers may be limited, necessitating the utilization of less capable alternatives. Thus, we propose the multimodal parallel offloading AIGC framework which partitions multimodal content and offloads partial diffusion tasks to multiple servers. Our proposed scheme accelerates mobile deep vision multimodal metaverse applications through parallel offloading provided by multiple servers. We further utilize the generative AI scheme to solve offloading problems to adapt the dynamic and available communication and computing resource in wireless IoT network. Our framework proposed a multimodal parallel diffusion offloading scheme with integrating the recurrent region proposal prediction algorithm to optimize communication and computing resources while minimizing delay. Simulation results show that our approach can significantly reduce delay compared to conventional algorithms.",

    abstract = "Discovery of communities in networks is a fundamental data analysis task. Recently, researchers have tried to improve its performance by exploiting node contents, and further interpret the communities using the derived semantics. However, the existing methods typically assume that the communities are assortative (i.e. members of each group are mostly connected to other members of the same group), and are unable to find the generalized community structure, e.g. structures with either assortative or disassortative communities (i.e. vertices of the same group have most of their connections outside their group), or a combination. In addition, these methods often assume that the network topology and node contents share the same group memberships, and thus cannot perform well when the contents mismatch with network structure. Also, they are limited to using only one topic to interpret each community. To address these two issues, we propose a new generative probabilistic model which is learned by using a nested expectation-maximization algorithm. It describes the generalized communities (based on network) and the content clusters (based on contents) separately, and further explores and models their correlation to improve as much as possible each of the communities and clusters based on the other. By depicting and utilizing this correlation, our model is not only robust with respect to the above problems, but is also able to interpret each community using more than one topic, which provides richer explanations. We validate the robustness of this proposed new approach on an artificial benchmark, and test its interpretability using a case study analysis. We finally show its definite superiority for community detection by comparing with seven state-of-the-art algorithms on eight real networks.",

While Deep Learning (DL) offers high accuracy in attack detection, its effectiveness is often limited by data imbalance and difficulty in identifying key features dynamically. Additionally, DL models are often criticized for their lack of interpretability, as their internal decisionmaking remains obscure. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents an explainable and adaptive DL-based security framework. It integrates a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to balance the dataset by generating realistic samples for underrepresented attack classes, and employs Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to identify temporal patterns and critical features. To enhance transparency, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) are used for interpreting the model's decisions.

Notably, the extracted semantic information is particularly important to downstream tasks like automatic medical scribe and automatic diagnosis systems. However, how to effectively leverage dialogue context to generate medical terms and their corresponding status accurately remains less explored. Existing generative approaches treat dialogue text as a single continuous text, ignoring conversational characteristics like colloquialism, redundancy and interactions. Between the doctor and the patient, a variety of colloquial medical information is frequently discussed. Each speaker (doctor and patient) plays a specific role in the interaction's goals. As a result, the importance of role information and interactions between utterances cannot be overstated. Furthermore, existing generative approaches only use character-level tokens, disregarding word-level tokens, which are the shortest meaningful utterances in Chinese. In this paper, we propose a Multi-granularity Transformer (MGT) model to enhance the dialogue context understanding from multi-granularity features. We incorporate word-level information by adapting a Lattice-based encoder with our proposed relative position encoding method. We further propose a Role Access Controlled Attention (RaCa) mechanism for introducing utterance-level interaction information. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets illustrate our model's validity and effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.",

Most non-learning methods try to solve this problem through the model-optimization scheme, which fails to produce promising results due to the shortage of suitable priors to model the difference between the reflection layer and the transmission layer. This paper presents an improved generative adversarial network to resolve this problem. First, we suggest that reflection removal is not only a channel-wise separation problem, but also a spatial variational occlusion removal task, which is sensitive to both spatial and channel-wise features. To this end, we integrate the CBAM module into the generator to enhance both spatial and channel-wise feature representation. Second, we consider the reflection layer as a spatial mask with space-relevant reflection intensity information, which can be used to elevate the performance of the discriminator. We then design a novel SNGAN structure with utilize the predicted reflection as a guidance to achieve better adversarial supervision. Specifically, our new generative network has an encoder-decoder structure with skip-connections, where the attention enhancement block is integrated into each skip-connection of the encoder-decoder subnet, and followed by an eight-layer fully convolutional subnet. Furthermore, the SNGAN loss is combined with L2 pixel loss and L1 VGG19 perceptual loss for training. The experimental results with benchmark datasets indicate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art networks.",

In this pursuit, our study adopts a comprehensive approach, aiming to seamlessly incorporate emotional intelligence into AI-driven interactions.

The physical principle of classification is based on time-domain pulse reflectometry (TDR).

According to the impedances encountered along the way, these signals carry information regarding the state of the line.

By transforming these signals into images and reducing their dimensionality, these signals are processed using convolutional neural networks (CNN). In particular, in this study, contrastive learning in Siamese networks was used for the classification of different types of faults (ToF). In addition, to avoid the problem of overfitting owing to the scarcity of examples, generative adversarial neural networks (GAN) have been used to synthesise new examples, enlarging the initial database. The combination of Siamese neural networks and GAN allows the classification of this type of signal using only synthesised examples to train and validate and only the original examples to test the network.

However, the availability of relevant data is hampered by different challenges, including scarcity, privacy issues, and the high cost of acquisition. Furthermore, existing data generation models are of low quality, uncontrollable, and lack generalizability. In this article, we propose a large language models (LLMs) driven framework that leverages the power of LLMs in concert with various domain-specific generative models (DGMs) to realize general multi-modal data synthesis. Specifically, our method employs LLMs as the core to interpret user requests, decompose a complex task into a manageable set of sub-tasks, and delegate each sub-task to the most suitable DGM, thereby automatically constructing customized data generation pipelines. Meanwhile, DGMs contribute their expertise to generate high-fidelity, domain-relevant data, whose specialized knowledge can be further enhanced by the LLM's broad linguistic knowledge via knowledge transfer. In addition, the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) is promising to enhance the framework's ability to optimally utilize DGMs, resulting in data generation with superior quality and control flexibility. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMs in augmenting domain-specific generative models via knowledge transfer and in facilitating multi-modal data synthesis through collaborative interactions with diverse DGMs.",

Many attempts have already been made to address the above issue by enlarging searching regions over the last years. However, introducing excessive background information makes the discriminative filter prone to learn from the surrounding context rather than the target. In this article, we propose a novel context restrained correlation tracking filter (CRCTF) that can effectively suppress background interference via incorporating high-quality adversarial generative negative instances. Concretely, we first construct an adversarial context generation network to simulate the central target area with surrounding background information at the initial frame. Then, we suggest a coarse background estimation network to accelerate the background generation in subsequent frames. By introducing a suppression convolution term, we utilize generative background patches to reformulate the original ridge regression objective through circulant property of correlation and a cropping operator. Finally, our tracking filter is efficiently solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). CRCTF demonstrates the accuracy performance on par with several well-established and highly optimized baselines on multiple challenging tracking datasets, verifying the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

    abstract = "Trend forecasting is vital to optimize the workload performance. It becomes even more urgent with an increasing number of applications and database configurations. However, DBAs mainly target at historical workloads and may give suboptimal configuration advice when the workload trends have changed. Although there are some studies on trend forecasting, they have several limitations. First, they mainly predict the changes of query numbers, which do not combine other critical factors (e.g., disk utilization) and cannot fully reflect the future workload trends. Besides, there are numerous queries in the workloads and exact clustering algorithms like K-means cannot effectively merge similar queries which contain noises like time shifts. Second, basic machine learning models like RNN may have relatively low prediction accuracy on complex workloads (e.g., no cycles but random bursts). Third, real-world workloads may have diverse patterns, while previous models cannot efficiently and reliably predict for all the different workload patterns.To address these challenges, we propose a trend forecasting system (DBAugur) that utilizes adversarial neural networks to predict the trends of different workloads. First, DBAugur collects the important features (e.g., queries, resource metrics) to characterize workloads, and reduces the number of involved queries by separately merging similar queries based on the SQL semantics and trend patterns. Second, DBAugur utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to capture the latent patterns, correlations between different metrics, and occasional bursts within the complicated and time-varying workloads. Moreover, we further propose a time-sensitive ensemble algorithm that takes advantage of various machine learning models (e.g., generative models, convolutional models, feed-forward models) to accommodate the various workload patterns. The experimental results show that DBAugur outperformed state-of-the-art methods on various real-world workloads.",

Existing claim-guided approaches tend to capture the structural, temporal, or relational indicative features among responsive posts to enhance representation learning, but few of them can integrate these features properly to comprehensively explore them. Additionally, large pre-trained language models are widely used for rumor debunking, such as Transformer-based models, which can result in collapsed issues and achieve poor performance on semantic textual similarity. Given these circumstances, we treat the rumor thread propagation as a conversation tree and propose a hybrid model, TRANS-CVAE, to learn a thread embedding encoded with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We then adopt a temporal-based Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) on this thread embedding to extract a compressed and latent representation from its latent semantic space. This latent embedding is revised by label-anchored contrastive loss. Using labels, this loss could pull together or push apart different threads to obtain better thread representations, and it could also alleviate the collapsed issue caused by BERT. Extensive experiments on the PHEME dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms many state-of-the-art rumor debunking models, and the ablation study also reflects the necessity of all three components to upgrade post-representation learning.",

    abstract = "Road crack detection is a key computer vision task that identifies and locates cracks in road surface images, which usually have an irregular shape and contain only a few pixels in width. Generative and unsupervised methods are popular these years, but generative methods require a lot of training data and computational power while unsupervised methods are not so satisfactory in pixel-level segmentation. The process is challenged by the irregularity of crack shapes and complex road image backgrounds. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel method in this paper, CDS-Net, that significantly improves road crack detection performance through multiple practical modules, including the Multi-Directional Hierarchical Attention (MDHA) module and the Difference Sensitivity Reconstruction Block (DSRB). Specifically, the MDHA module employs a multi-directional feature extraction strategy to capture detailed information of cracks, thereby enhancing the discriminative power of the features. The DSRB module, designed to address the inefficiency of traditional skip-connections, utilizes masked convolution and graph convolution attention to reconstruct and refine feature representations. Additionally, we propose an improved weighted cross-entropy loss function to address the inherent class imbalance problem in road crack detection. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that CDS-Net achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness in road crack detection. It also has a stronger generalization ability compared with other methods. Code is available at https://github.com/ttttqz/CDS-Net/tree/master.",

    abstract = "Unsupervised domain adaptation deals with a task from an unlabeled target domain by leveraging the knowledge gained from labeled source domain(s). The fuzzy system is adopted in domain adaptation to better tackle the uncertainty caused by information scarcity in the transfer. Most existing fuzzy and nonfuzzy domain adaptation methods depend on data-level distribution matching to eliminate the domain shift. However, data sharing can trigger privacy concerns. This situation results in the unavailability of source data, wherein most domain adaptation methods cannot be applied. Source-free domain adaptation is then proposed to handle this problem. But the existing source-free domain adaptation methods rarely deal with any soft information component due to data imprecision. Besides, fewer methods handle multiple source domains that provide richer transfer information. Thus, in this article, we propose source-free multidomain adaptation with fuzzy rule-based deep neural networks, which takes advantage of a fuzzy system to handle data uncertainty in domain adaptation without source data. To learn source private models with high generality, which is important to collect low-noise pseudotarget labels, auxiliary tasks are designed by jointly training source models from multiple domains, which share source parameters and fuzzy rules while protecting source data. To transfer fuzzy rules and fit source private parameters to the target domain, self-supervised learning and anchor-based alignment are built to force target data into source feature spaces. Experiments on real-world datasets under both homogeneous and heterogeneous label space scenarios are carried out to validate the proposed method. The results indicate the superiority of the proposed fuzzy rule-based source-free multidomain adaptation method.",

    abstract = "Diagnosing and classifying breast cancer tumors is a rather complex activity for pathologists due to the heterogeneous nature of the tumor cells. The wide use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the rise of Deep Learning (DL) have led to promising results in terms of breast histopathology images classification. The outcomes depend largely on two main factors, namely, the number and quality of images. BreaKhis dataset shows an imbalance in the image classes distribution, thus generating the performance degradation of the classifier model due to a biased classification towards the majority class. In this paper, a Deep Convolution Generative Adversial Network (DCGAN) is applied to give the number of images consistence in the minority (benign) class with that of the majority (malignant) class. Data augmentation is a technique used later to create more data from the limited ones. The DenseNet201 pre-trained model is chosen and used with the concatenation of features from various DensNet blocks. Instead of considering all the layers of the pre-trained network, the features are extracted from the lower layers of DensNet201, via a global average pooling (GAP). These features are passed to the softmax classifier to classify breast cancer. The model is evaluated using a two-class BreaKhis, provided at four magnification levels 40x, 100x, 200x, and 400x. The proposed method yielded test accuracies of 96\%, 95\%, 88\%, and 92\% respectively for each magnification factor. As indicated in the results, the proposed method based on data augmentation by DCGAN and feature concatenation using DenseNet201 pre-trained models could produce an efficient prediction for breast cancer image classification.",

Our observations indicate that introducing synthetic patches leads to notable improvements in the evaluated metrics, underscoring the utility of generative models within CBIR tasks. Furthermore, this work is the first in the literature where latent representations optimized for CBIR are used to train an attention mechanism for performing Gleason Scoring of a WSI.",

This is reinforced by the breakthrough of a generative model that is considered to be able to help many tasks that are usually done by humans, namely ChatGPT. ChatGPT successfully demonstrated its potential by providing complete and intact code generation. ChatGPT, with GPT-3, is one of many language models currently available for people. In previous research, ChatGPT was tested to see if it could provide appropriate programming code results and perform large-scale data analysis on a specific dataset described in sentence form. The limitations of ChatGPT include understanding and generating code, which requires further training data. This opportunity positions ChatGPT as a provider of programming materials and a place to seek solutions to problems faced by programmers. This paper investigates the capabilities and also limitations of ChatGPT to help with the works of programmer‚Äôs daily tasks by examining overall ChatGPT capabilities within the assigned environment as a Programmer Assistant and examining the overall probability of ChatGPT limitations and failures to generate the results from specified prompts from the programmer. This study formulated the research question and performed the PRISMA step to answer the question.

To effectively remove the internal multiples from the seismic data, we propose the unsupervised deep neural network (DNN) combined with the adaptive virtual events (AVEs) method. First, we use the AVE method to get the predicted internal multiples, which can calibrate the true internal multiples in the original data, also called the full wavefield data. Second, the unsupervised learning with the DNN is used as a nonlinear operator to minimize the difference between the estimated internal multiples and original data. The trained DNN can obtain the estimated internal multiples through the predicted internal multiples, thereby completing the suppression of the internal multiples. Since our proposed unsupervised learning is essentially an optimization process, it does not require true primaries as the label data to participate in the training process for the DNN. Therefore, our proposed method can deal with the problem of lack of training set and would have some good practical application value with low computational cost. The effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method are verified through two sets of synthetic data and one land field data examples.",

Our approach involves a distributed DViT inference mechanism where road-side units (RSUs) and vehicles collaborate to execute the diffusion process and generate personalized content within vehicles using local prompts. Additionally, we address users' latency-sensitive service demands by formulating a distributed latency optimization problem that considers bandwidth, computation power, and dynamic positioning of heterogeneous devices. We then propose a value iteration-based distributed inference algorithm capable of adaptively determining optimal inference strategies within resource-constrained vehicular networks. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in reducing latency and enhancing success rates for inference tasks.",

This paper proposes an enhanced framework, U-GAT-IT (Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization), integrating multi-scale attention mechanisms and adaptive normalization (AdaLIN) to address these limitations. The attention module dynamically prioritizes critical facial features across hierarchical levels, balancing local details and global structures. AdaLIN adaptively fuses Instance and Layer Normalization, enabling content-aware stylization intensity adjustment. Experiments on a dataset of 10,000 Asian faces and 10,000 anime images demonstrate U-GAT-IT‚Äôs superiority: it achieves a 25\% improvement in eye transformation accuracy (SSIM) and 30\% faster convergence compared to Cycle-GAN. Results show realistic cartoon avatars with preserved geometric consistency, complete background removal, and reduced noise artifacts. Additionally, U-GAT-IT exhibits robustness in cross-domain tasks, such as medical imaging.

To alleviate these, we propose Diffusion with Noise-Aware Feature(DNAF). Concretely, we leverage the T2I-Adapter-based pose adapter to achieve the mapping from the pixel level to the feature level. Then, we propose a lightweight trainable layer to infuse the multi-scale constant feature adaptively. In the end, we construct noise-aware features to more effectively guide the diffusion process.

The task entails learning to differentiate between various classes in a support set and leveraging this knowledge on samples within a query set. However, traditional deep learning methods tend to underperform in this context due to limited training samples and subtle correlations between query and support images that are inadequately utilized. Existing methods for FSSS often compress support information into prototype categories or utilize only partial pixel-level support information, resulting in a significant impact. In this article, we propose a novel auto FSSS method that employs dense multicross self-attention and adaptive gate perception units to tackle this challenge. Specifically, our proposed method treats each query pixel as a label and predicts its segmentation label as the sum of labels of all support pixels. The method fully utilizes foreground and background support information through multilevel pixel correlations between paired query and support features to achieve state-of-the-art performance with only 1‚Äì5 annotated images. Moreover, our proposed adaptive gating perception unit filters and weighs each support image information by adaptively learning the gating values. This ensures the model selects only the most relevant support image information to the current query image. The proposed method is evaluated on several popular FSSS datasets and compared with state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a visual analysis of our method is conducted to demonstrate its ability to distinguish different semantic categories and exhibit robustness at segmentation boundaries.",

These sophisticated fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism. To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage and mem-ory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake detection tasks.

Knowing that the learning confidence depends significantly on small changes, such as noise, created a mind change in the artificial intelligence community, who started to consider the boundaries and limitations of machine learning methods. However, if we can measure these limitations, we can improve the strength of our machine learning models and their robustness. Following this motivation, this work introduces different measures of robustness for machine learning models based on false negatives. These measures can be evaluated for either static or dynamic scenarios, where an adversary performs intelligent actions to evade the system. To evaluate the metrics I have applied 11 classifiers to different benchmark datasets and created an adversary that performs an evolutionary search process aiming to reduce the classification accuracy. The results show that the most robust models are related to K-Nearest Neighbours, Logistic regression, and neural networks, although none of the systems is robust enough when the target is to reach a single misclassification.",

Despite the significant interest attracted from both academia and industry, there remains an immediate demand for more in-depth research to unravel how these two objectives can be simultaneously integrated into ML models. As opposed to well-accepted trade-offs, i.e., privacy-utility and fairness-utility, the interrelation between privacy and fairness is not well-understood. While some works suggest a trade-off between the two objective functions, there are others that demonstrate the alignment of these functions in certain scenarios. To fill this research gap, we provide a thorough review of privacy and fairness in ML, including supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised, and reinforcement learning. After examining and consolidating the literature on both objectives, we present a holistic survey on the impact of privacy on fairness, the impact of fairness on privacy, existing architectures, their interaction in application domains, and algorithms that aim to achieve both objectives while minimizing the utility sacrificed. Finally, we identify research challenges in achieving concurrently privacy and fairness in ML, particularly focusing on large language models.",

Machine learning models were trained on diverse, complex datasets to counter sophisticated AI-based attacks in multi-environments (M-En). We have utilized auto-encoders to generate our M-En dataset by combining two benchmark datasets: UNSW-NB15 and IoTID-20, that represent traditional IP-based and IoT-based traffic, respectively. Three generative models (CTGAN, CopulaGAN, and TVAE) produced AI-based traffic, leading to a dataset comprising traditional and AI-generated traffic.

Due to their highly realistic nature, detecting deepfakes has become a major challenge, highlighting the critical need for robust detection systems. This research investigates the performance of nine advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, namely: Custom CNN, ResNet50, VGG16, InceptionV3, DenseNet, MobileNetV2, XceptionNet, MesoNet, and InceptionResNetV2 which were used to detect deepfakes. To evaluate the effectiveness of the above CNN architectures, two large-scale image datasets were used: the Real \& Deepfake Dataset and the 140K Real and Fake Faces Dataset. These datasets include more than 2,00,000 real and fake images. The training was done using a GPU to increase the speed and accuracy of the models. Among all the models, the Custom CNN provided the best results, reaching 99\% accuracy on the Real \& Deepfake Dataset and 98\% on the 140K dataset. ResNet50, DenseNet, and InceptionV3 also performed very well, each scoring above 90\% accuracy in both datasets. Other models like VGG16, MobileNetV2, XceptionNet, and InceptionResNetV2 also showed strong results, proving they are useful for deepfake detection.

Preprocessing models that remove perturbations are an effective approach for enhancing the robustness of classification models. However, most existing methods overlook a critical issue: although powerful preprocessing operations can remove adversarial perturbations, they may also weaken the representation of key features in the image, leading to decreased defense performance. To address this, we propose a novel universal defense model, APR-Net, which aims to remove adversarial perturbations while effectively preserving high-quality images. The key innovation of APR-Net lies in its dual-module design, which consists of a denoising module and an image restoration module. This design not only effectively eliminates imperceptible adversarial perturbations but also ensures the restoration of high-quality images. Unlike existing methods, APR-Net does not require modifications to the classifier architecture or specialized adversarial training, making it highly versatile. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that APR-Net provides strong defense against various adversarial attack algorithms, significantly improves image quality, and outperforms other state-of-the-art defense methods in terms of overall performance.",

We pre-train APC on large-scale unlabeled data and conduct transfer learning experiments on three speech applications that require different information about speech characteristics to perform well: speech recognition, speech translation, and speaker identification. Extensive experiments show that APC not only outperforms surface features (e.g., log Mel spectrograms) and other popular representation learning methods on all three tasks, but is also effective at reducing downstream labeled data size and model parameters.

    abstract = "Driving accident is the event that occur unexpectedly and should be detected effectively for autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose a method based on adversarial appearance-motion prediction for driving accident detection in dashcam videos. The novelty of this method is to consider the predictability of the frame-level and object-level motion and appearance from the current to the future. Through a self-supervised adversarial learning between the real observation in next frame and the predicted motion and appearance, the objects that may occur accident are detected. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the detection results of our method, we evaluate the performance on A3D dataset, and the effectiveness of the method is validated.",

    abstract = "The application of deep learning networks in med-ical image analysis has become increasingly mature. However, the availability of a large amount of medical image data for training deep learning networks is hindered by various factors such as workload of doctors, different devices, and ethical privacy policies. These factors can limit the full potential of deep learning network models. In recent years, generative models, particularly diffusion models, have made significant progress in synthesizing realistic images in various domains. Nevertheless, there is currently limited research on the application of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in medical image generation, especially when generating different types of medical images using a unified process. In our research, we explore the use of LDMs to generate synthetic images from various medical image datasets. We train the LDMs on the BreastMRI, Hand, HeadCT, and CXR images extracted from the MedNIST dataset. By employing a consistent LDMs architecture, we aim to generate images from different medical device sources. Additionally, we assess the similarity between the generated images and the real images to evaluate the performance of our approach.",

    abstract = "Lung function evaluation is important to many medical applications, but conducting pulmonary function tests is constrained by different conditions. This article presents a pioneer study of an integrated invertible deep learning method for lung function estimation via using computed tomography (CT) images. First, the projection method is proposed to flatten the three-dimensional (3-D) image onto a two-dimensional (2-D) plane, with preserving location information in 3-D. Next, the MBConv transformer-based encoder‚Äìdecoder structure is developed to extract latent features. Finally, we develop an invertible normalizing flow (NF) model to infer lung function based on the extracted features and design two loss functions for two directions. The method enables both estimating the lung function based on CT images and metadata as well as generating the corresponding simulated CT image according to the lung function. Computational studies show that the proposed regression model outperforms all state-of-the-art image regression models. A comprehensive comparative analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of using generated images and confirms the superiority of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first of its kind in combining encoder‚Äìdecoder network with NFs to ensure the effectiveness of the fully invertible framework, especially in lung CT image analysis.",

    abstract = "In recent years, CT examinations have been widely used as a screening method to detect lung cancer. However, reading enormous CT images become a heavy burden to the physician. To avoid this problem, computer-aided diagnosis systems have been introduced on CT screening. In general, physicians consider patient information in addition to image information when they make a diagnosis, new efforts are being made to improve the accuracy of diagnosis by mimicking this information with a machine. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying pulmonary nodules by adding medical record information to images to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We classify nodules from unknown data by assigning branching information of vascular opacities, straight vascular shadows, and nodular shadows as labeled image, which are a cause of misrecognition based on image features in machine learning. In the experiment, the classification accuracy of the nodule class was improved by adding clinical information to 644 images including 161 nodal images.",

    abstract = "With the wide application of artificial intelligence, cloud computing and Internet of things, we have entered a new era of intelligent interconnection. However, network security threats and risks are also increasing. At present, it is urgent to solve how to effectively combat network attacks and ensure network security. Network traffic analysis plays a key role in intrusion detection. By accurately classifying network traffic, network intrusion can be more targeted. However, due to the imbalance of categories in the data samples, the recognition accuracy of minority classes is low. In order to cope with this challenge, an improved network traffic analysis method based on Attention-CNN-Bi LSTM is proposed. This method first balances the data set, then uses the feature selection strategy to eliminate unnecessary features, and uses the combined neural network model for training. The experimental simulation of this method shows that the AUC value of the minority class exceeds 0.85 on both data sets, which shows that the method has good generalization performance for the minority class and solves the problem of low accuracy of the minority class in the unbalanced data set.",
