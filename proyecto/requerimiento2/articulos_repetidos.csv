As AI’s power grows, so does the need to figure out what—and who—this technology is really for. AI Needs You argues that it is critical for society to take the lead in answering this urgent question and ensuring that AI fulfills its promise.Verity Harding draws inspiring lessons from the histories of three twentieth-century tech revolutions—the space race, in vitro fertilization, and the internet—to empower each of us to join the conversation about AI and its possible futures. Sharing her perspective as a leading insider in technology and politics, she rejects the dominant narrative, which often likens AI’s advent to that of the atomic bomb. History points the way to an achievable future in which democratically determined values guide AI to be peaceful in its intent; to embrace limitations; to serve purpose, not profit; and to be firmly rooted in societal trust.AI Needs You gives us hope that we, the people, can imbue AI with a deep intentionality that reflects our best values, ideals, and interests, and that serves the public good. AI will permeate our lives in unforeseeable ways, but it is clear that the shape of AI’s future—and of our own—cannot be left only to those building it. It is up to us to guide this technology away from our worst fears and toward a future that we can trust and believe in."

,"Seyedsalehi, Shirin and Bigdeli, Amin and Arabzadeh, Negar and AlMousawi, Batool and Marshall, Zack and Zihayat, Morteza and Bagheri, Ebrahim",,"Gender bias is a pervasive issue that continues to influence various aspects of society, including the outcomes of information retrieval (IR) systems. As these systems become increasingly integral to accessing and navigating the vast amounts of information available today, the need to understand and mitigate gender bias within them is paramount. This monograph provides a comprehensive examination of the origins, manifestations, and consequences of gender bias in IR systems, as well as the current methodologies employed to address these biases. Theoretical frameworks surrounding gender and its representation in artificial intelligence (AI) systems are explored, particularly focusing on how traditional gender binaries are perpetuated and reinforced through data and algorithmic processes. Metrics and methodologies used to identify and measure gender bias within IR systems are then analyzed, offering a detailed evaluation of existing approaches and their limitations. Subsequent sections address the sources of gender bias, including biased input queries, retrieval methods, and gold standard datasets. Various data-driven and method-level debiasing strategies are presented, including techniques for debiasing neural embeddings and algorithmic approaches aimed at reducing bias in IR system outputs. The monograph concludes with a discussion of the challenges and limitations faced by current debiasing efforts and provides insights into future research directions that could lead to more equitable and inclusive IR systems. This monograph serves as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and students in the fields of information retrieval, artificial intelligence, and data science, providing the knowledge and tools needed to address gender bias and contribute to the development of fair and unbiased information systems."
