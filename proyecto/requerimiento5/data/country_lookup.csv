Generative AI models are ideal solutions where models suffer due to scarcity of data sample that hinders the training process be it text, video, audio, and image. Training the model plays a pivotal role, where it discovers the hidden pattern and understands the intrinsic behavior of samples that aid in generating realistic samples. The volume of data that is available for training and the computing power required pose threat on the performance of the intelligent systems, where large language models (LLM) has been an ideal solution. LLMs are generative AI systems that understand human language and provide intelligent, creative solutions to questions. Complex architecture of LLM allows them to capture the intricacies of language more precise, enabling to generate coherent and contextually relevant outputs. This chapter delves into comprehensive analysis on the well-known generative AI models such as generative adversarial networks, transformers, and LangChain. Generative AI employs different training techniques such as reinforcement learning, adversarial training, variational inference, transfer learning, and progressive training on diverse application domains. Furthermore, the study examines the crucial aspect of evaluating the effectiveness of generative models, using a variety of metrics ranging from BLUE, inception score, perplexity, Frechet inception distance, precision, ROUGE, recall, METEOR, BERT, MoverScore, and many more. A comparative analysis of these metrics offers insights into their respective advantages and disadvantages, aiding practitioners and researchers in selecting benchmarks that align with their specific use cases.', 'pages': '43-68', 'number': '', 'volume': '', 'year': '2024', 'title': '3 Generative AI Models and LLM: Training Techniques and Evaluation Metrics', 'booktitle': 'Generative AI and LLMs: Natural Language Processing and Generative Adversarial Networks', 'author': 'Arun, C. and Karthick, S. and Selvakumara Samy, S. and Hariharan, B. and Lee, Po-Ming', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inbook', 'ID': '11164582'}",United States,,heuristic,0.3

Quantum computing holds the potential to transform the computational world. Big Data is the main source for modern AI systems, providing the information for machine learning (ML) to get better. The evolution in AI is driven by advanced ML algorithms, an open source culture, and a suite of tools and libraries that streamline AI development.</p>"", 'pages': '219-283', 'number': '', 'volume': '', 'year': '2024', 'title': ""Generative AI's Exponential Growth"", 'booktitle': 'Generative AI: Navigating the Course to the Artificial General Intelligence Future', 'author': 'Musiol, Martin', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inbook', 'ID': '10952212'}",United States,,heuristic,0.3

Its main task is to distinguish the counting of cross coils and standard coils. Relying on manual counting is not only inefficient but also has large error. In order to improve the work efficiency of product detection, deep learning technology is used to realize automatic counting. The common deep learning counting model is realized by convolution neural network classification, but it can only recognize the fixed number of turns. A full revolution region neural network (FCRN) model is then proposed to solve the winding problem on micro terminal. The model consists of three parts: (a) the Faster RCNN to detect coils from scene images; (b) a FCRN network including a full convolution network (FCN) followed by two ASPP pooling to extract the coil features, and two prediction branches, i.e. a semantic segmentation branch and a regression counting branch to predict the coil segmentation images and to predict the coil turns number, respectively; and, (c) the horizontal projection algorithm to analyse whether the prediction images represent cross coil. The experimental results show that, compared with the counting model directly using CNN classification, the FCRN counting model works well in the environment with fewer samples, and can identify cross coil at the same time of counting, which improves its adaptability and accuracy. Thus, it can improve the detection rate of products.', 'pages': '1-6', 'number': '', 'volume': '', 'year': '2021', 'title': 'A coil counting model based on full convolution regression neural networks', 'booktitle': 'AIIPCC 2021; The Second International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Information Processing and Cloud Computing', 'author': 'Liang, Xixi and Zhao, Erdun and Li, Ting and Lin, Zhuocheng', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inproceedings', 'ID': '9547887'}",United States,,heuristic,0.3

It automatically and gradually improves their efficiency, accuracy, and precision with the number of experiments in which these models (algorithms) are trained. Deep learning (DL) replicates the basic structure of biological neurons, using complex algorithms, allowing predictive digital health and also allowing logical and complex structures to be established, without the need for human supervision. In other words, it is a digital architecture to study, understand, and learn how to interpret information related to the object of study that helps to more accurately identify a tumor, for example, considering that they do not need to be an expert in the field to perform this type of identification through technology. In the same sense as more pertinent diagnostic recommendations, are some examples of the application of this type of technology that can be widely used in various health segments. Emphasizing that it will give the doctor and the patient more accurate diagnoses, faster diagnoses, more assertive treatments, better-calculated risks, possibility of detecting infections, abnormalities, and diseases in a matter of seconds, the use of deep learning in health is very well accepted for reducing the margin of human error. Therefore, this manuscript aims to provide an updated overview of DL, concerning its essential concepts and in the field of medicine, as also its relationships in frameworks with meaningful intelligent properties, enabling cost-effective personalized digital services as a primary goal in healthcare in the current modern scenario.', 'pages': '225-244', 'number': '', 'volume': '', 'year': '2021', 'title': 'An overview of the technological performance of deep learning in modern medicine', 'booktitle': 'Deep Learning for Personalized Healthcare Services', 'author': 'Monteiro, Ana Carolina Borges and França, Reinaldo Padilha and Arthur, Rangel and Iano, Yuzo', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inbook', 'ID': '10789125'}",Mali,,heuristic,0.3

The book provides examples of how AI increases productivity, which professions are changing or disappearing, and how job markets will evolve in the coming years. With this book, you\'ll learn to recognize the opportunities and risks AI offers. Understand what this change demands from individuals and companies and what strategic skills are required. The book also covers legal questions caused by generative AI, like copyrights, data protection, and AI regulation. It also ponders societal impacts. AI produces content, thus influencing language, culture, and even worldviews. Therefore, it\'s crucial to understand by whom and how AI is trained. The AI revolution started by ChatGPT is just the beginning.
