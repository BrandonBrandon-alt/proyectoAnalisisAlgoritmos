  abstract = {The development and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) have brought numerous problems and potential threats, such as information cocoons, algorithmic collusion, algorithmic bias and privacy, issues. To combat these issues, governments all over the world, international organizations and giant tech companies all have taken actions and reached an agreement that AI should be trusted. However, there is no uniform definition on trusted AI. In the paper, we make a survey on related works on artificial intelligence principles and ethical guidelines. Then analyze the ethical foundations of trusted AI and give a definition on trusted AI. We propose specific requirements of trusted AI from a technical perspective and give explanations on these technique requirements. Finally, best practices are recommended to achieve trusted AI and promote the responsible use of AI.},

  abstract = {<p>Defining Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not easy as AI is a young discipline. However, the field of AI got officially defined in 1956 with a workshop organized by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project. The goal of this conference was to investigate ways in which machines could be made to simulate aspects of intelligence. In 1965, computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, an early conversational AI program capable of natural language interaction. Though intended to showcase the superficiality of communication between humans and artificial intelligence, ELIZA's uncannily human&#x2010;like responses led many to curiously anthropomorphize its underlying system. The possibility to use massive volumes of data changed everything and triggered a new boom supported by the Big Data era, the access to large amounts of data, cheaper and faster computers, and progress on machine learning.</p>},

  abstract = {Summary <p>The accelerated pace of the implementation of AI in architecture has given rise to a fascinating field of inquiry, demanding rigorous examination and investigation. One of the most significant advantages of incorporating AI into architecture is the ability to expand the human mind's creative capabilities. AI tools and algorithms offer architects access to a vast repository of data, design precedents and advanced computational capabilities, enabling them to generate innovative ideas and solutions. By considering the values and narratives embedded within architecture's cultural and historical contexts, designers can craft more inclusive, meaningful and people&#x2010;centred designs that resonate with the diverse communities they serve. To that end, machine learning, deep learning and other concepts that are subsumed under the umbrella term &#x2018;artificial intelligence&#x2019; can help designers explore the large data vaults of culture in order to inform, expand and enrich the design space of architecture.</p>},

  abstract = {Contribution: A novel proactive and collaborative learning paradigm was proposed to engage learners with different backgrounds and enable effective retention and transfer of the multidisciplinary artificial intelligence (AI)-cybersecurity knowledge. Specifically, the proposed learning paradigm contains: 1) an immersive learning environment to motivate the students for exploring AI/ machine learning (ML) development in the context of real-world cybersecurity scenarios by constructing learning models with tangible objects and 2) a proactive education paradigm designed with the use of collaborative learning activities based on game-based learning and social constructivism. Background: Increasing evidence shows that AI techniques can be manipulated, evaded, and misled, which can result in new and profound security implications. There is an education and training gap to foster a qualified cyber-workforce that understands the usefulness, limitations, and best practices of AI technologies in the cybersecurity domain. Efforts have been made to incorporate a comprehensive curriculum to meet the demand. There still remain essential challenges for effectively educating students on the interaction of AI and cybersecurity. Intended Outcomes: A novel proactive and collaborative learning paradigm is proposed to educate and train a qualified cyber-workforce in this new era where security breaches, privacy violations, and AI have become commonplace. Application Design: The development of this learning paradigm is grounded in the pedagogical approaches of technology-mediated learning and social constructivism. Findings: Although the research work is still ongoing, the prototype learning paradigm has shown encouraging results in promoting the learners’ engagement in applied AI learning.},

  abstract = {Purpose We compared the performance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) (Augmented Transformer Assisted Radiology Intelligence [ATARI, Microsoft Nuance, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington]) and natural language processing (NLP) tools for identifying laterality errors in radiology reports and images. Methods We used an NLP-based (mPower, Microsoft Nuance) tool to identify radiology reports flagged for laterality errors in its Quality Assurance Dashboard. The NLP model detects and highlights laterality mismatches in radiology reports. From an initial pool of 1,124 radiology reports flagged by the NLP for laterality errors, we selected and evaluated 898 reports that encompassed radiography, CT, MRI, and ultrasound modalities to ensure comprehensive coverage. A radiologist reviewed each radiology report to assess if the flagged laterality errors were present (reporting error—true-positive) or absent (NLP error—false-positive). Next, we applied ATARI to 237 radiology reports and images with consecutive NLP true-positive (118 reports) and false-positive (119 reports) laterality errors. We estimated accuracy of NLP and generative AI tools to identify overall and modality-wise laterality errors. Results Among the 898 NLP-flagged laterality errors, 64% (574 of 898) had NLP errors and 36% (324 of 898) were reporting errors. The text query ATARI feature correctly identified the absence of laterality mismatch (NLP false-positives) with a 97.4% accuracy (115 of 118 reports; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 96.5%-98.3%). Combined vision and text query resulted in 98.3% accuracy (116 of 118 reports or images; 95% CI = 97.6%-99.0%), and query alone had a 98.3% accuracy (116 of 118 images; 95% CI = 97.6%-99.0%). Conclusion The generative AI-empowered ATARI prototype outperformed the assessed NLP tool for determining true and false laterality errors in radiology reports while enabling an image-based laterality determination. Underlying errors in ATARI text query in complex radiology reports emphasize the need for further improvement in the technology.},

As an emerging technology, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential to optimize ED operations and reduce wait times. Objective Establish a strategy to evaluate AI modeling as it relates to utilizing AI based strategies for ED flow. Methods We searched Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Scopus for English-language studies published from January 1, 1946, to August 17, 2023, and we will update our search to ensure currency. The ROBINS-I tool assessed study quality, while PROBAST examined the risk of bias and applicability. Results Out of 17,569 screened studies, 65 full-text articles were evaluated for eligibility, with 16 quantitative observational studies meeting inclusion criteria. The best-performing algorithms included regression-based methods (n = 2), traditional single-model machine learning (n = 8), neural networks/deep learning (n = 3), natural language processing (n = 1), and ensemble methods (n = 2). None of the studies examined AI’s impact in a real ED setting, though four simulations reported wait-time reductions ranging from 7 to 43.2 minutes. Conclusions AI integration in ED is still in its infancy. Our review found no real-world ED implementation studies, and most of the existing research lacked involvement from ED experts. This gap highlights the lack of insight into AI’s practical impact. Future reviews and research must clarify these dimensions, guiding AI's effective, collaborative adoption in ED workflows.},

Nanocarrier-based delivery systems can overcome these limitations. However, their development often relies on time-consuming trial-and-error methods, which lack personalization. This review explores how advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models enhance nanocarrier formulation for phytoconstituents. These models include machine learning, deep learning, transformer-based models, and graph neural networks. They optimize nanocarrier selection, drug–carrier compatibility, and release profiles while incorporating patient-specific omics data. These computational tools accurately predict key parameters, such as particle size, drug loading, and release kinetics, for phytoactives like curcumin, quercetin, and genistein. Emerging applications include optimizing herbal nanocarriers for antimicrobial efficacy in infectious disease treatment. By integrating genomics, microbiome, and metabolomics data, these models enable tailored herbal nanomedicines. This data-driven approach, combining nanotechnology with phytomedicine, accelerates formulation, improves therapeutic efficacy, and advances precision herbal therapeutics. It also shows promise for infectious disease applications. Progress in explainable AI and supportive regulatory frameworks is essential for clinical translation.},

  keywords = {Semantic communication, Generative artificial intelligence, Large language model, Variational autoencoder, Generative adversarial network, Diffusion model},
  abstract = {Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for future wireless networks, aiming to improve communication efficiency by transmitting only the semantic meaning (or its encoded version) of the source data rather than the complete set of bits (symbols). However, traditional deep learning-based SemCom systems present challenges such as limited generalization, low robustness, and inadequate reasoning capabilities, primarily due to the inherently discriminative nature of deep neural networks. To address these limitations, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is seen as a promising solution, offering notable advantages in learning complex data distributions, transforming data between high- and low-dimensional spaces, and generating high-quality content. This paper explores the applications of GAI in SemCom and presents a comprehensive study. It begins by introducing three widely used SemCom systems enabled by classical GAI models: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. For each system, the fundamental concept of the GAI model, the corresponding SemCom architecture, and a literature review of recent developments are provided. Subsequently, a novel generative SemCom system is proposed, incorporating cutting-edge GAI technology—large language models (LLMs). This system features LLM-based artificial intelligence (AI) agents at both the transmitter and receiver, which act as “brains” to enable advanced information understanding and content regeneration capabilities, respectively. Unlike traditional systems that focus on bitstream recovery, this design allows the receiver to directly generate the desired content from the coded semantic information sent by the transmitter. As a result, the communication paradigm shifts from “information recovery” to “information regeneration,” marking a new era in generative SemCom. A case study on point-to-point video retrieval is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, showing a 99.98% reduction in communication overhead and a 53% improvement in average retrieval accuracy compared to traditional communication systems. Furthermore, four typical application scenarios for generative SemCom are described, followed by a discussion of three open issues for future research. In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive set of guidelines for applying GAI in SemCom, laying the groundwork for the efficient deployment of generative SemCom in future wireless networks.},

  abstract = {Purpose A gripping keyword emerged in the dynamic world of 2022: GPT or the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), at its forefront, embodied by the mysterious ChatGPT. This technological marvel had been silently lurking in the background for just over five years. However, all of a sudden, it emerged onto the scene, capturing the public’s attention and quickly becoming one of the most widely adopted inventions in history. Therefore, this narrative review is conducted in order to explore the impact of generative AI and ChatGPT on lifelong learning and upskilling of students in higher education and address opportunities and challenges proposed by Artificial Intelligence from a global perspective. Design/methodology/approach This review has been conducted using a narrative literature review approach. For in-depth identification of research gaps, 105 relevant articles were included from scholarly databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, ERIC and Google Scholar. Seven major themes emerged from the literature to answer the targeted research questions that describe the use of AI, the impact of generative AI and ChatGPT on students, the challenges and opportunities of using AI in education and mitigating strategies to cope with the challenges associated with the integration of ChatGPT and generative AI in education. Findings The review of the literature presents that generative AI and ChatGPT have gained a lot of recognition among students and have revolutionized educational settings. The findings suggest that there are some contexts in which adult education research and teaching can benefit from the use of chatbots and generative AI technologies like ChatGPT. The literature does, however, also highlight the necessity of carefully considering the benefits and drawbacks of these technologies in order to prevent restricting or distorting the educational process or endangering academic integrity. In addition, the literature raises ethical questions about data security, privacy and cheating by students or researchers. To these, we add our own ethical concerns about intellectual property, such as the fact that, once we enter ideas or research results into a generative chatbot, we no longer have control over how it is used. Practical implications This review is helpful for educators and policymakers to design the curriculum and policies that encourage students to use generative AI ethically while taking academic integrity into account. Also, this review article identifies the major gaps that are associated with the impact of AI and ChatGPT on the lifelong learning skills of students. Originality/value This review of the literature is unique because it explains the challenges and opportunities of using generative AI and ChatGPT, also defining its impact on lifelong learning and upskilling of students.},

Despite technical advancements, the widespread integration of AI into RT treatment planning faces challenges. The transition from controlled retrospective environments to real-world clinical settings introduces heightened scrutiny from clinical end users, potentially leading to decreased clinical acceptance. Key considerations for implementing AI RT planning include ensuring the AI model performance aligns with clinical standards, using high-quality training data, and incorporating sufficient data variation through meticulous curation by clinical experts. Beyond technical aspects, factors such as potential biases and the level of trust clinical end users place in AI may present unforeseen obstacles for real-world clinical use. Addressing these challenges requires bridging education and expertise gaps among clinical end users, enabling them to confidently embrace and utilize AI for routine RT planning. By fostering a better understanding of AI capabilities, building trust, and providing comprehensive training, the promises of AI RT planning can be a reality in the clinical setting. This article assesses the current clinical use of AI RT planning and explores challenges and considerations for bridging gaps in knowledge and expertise for AI operationalization, with focus on training data curation, workflow integration, explainability, bias, and domain knowledge.

This research overcomes these obstacles by applying feature engineering and selecting features using the Boruta method, which guarantees that the analysis is informed solely by the most relevant features. Applying three machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and artificial neural networks (ANN) to this refined dataset showed that the artificial neural networks outperformed the competing models with an accuracy of 0.84, largely due to its capacity to represent complicated, non-linear relationships. With an accuracy of 0.79, SVM proved its validity despite feature dependencies, whereas Naive Bayes attained 0.76. These results demonstrate that ANN has great promise as a tool for data-driven decision-making in important industries, with the ability to improve operational efficiency, reduce system failures, and strengthen maintenance plans.},

Objective To demonstrate that INSIDE PC can help clinicians query the literature on therapeutic sequencing in PC and to develop previously unestablished practices for evaluating the outputs of AI-based support platforms. Design, setting, and participants INSIDE PC was developed by customizing PubMed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Publications were ranked and aggregated for relevance using data visualization and analytics. Publications returned by INSIDE PC and PubMed were given normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) scores by PC experts reflecting ranking and relevance. Intervention INSIDE PC for AI-based semantic literature analysis. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis INSIDE PC was evaluated for relevance and accuracy for three test questions on the efficacy of therapeutic sequencing of systemic therapies in PC. Results and limitations In this initial evaluation, INSIDE PC outperformed PubMed for question 1 (novel hormonal therapy [NHT] followed by NHT) for the top five, ten, and 20 publications (nDCG score, +43, +33, and +30 percentage points [pps], respectively). For question 2 (NHT followed by poly [adenosine diphosphate ribose] polymerase inhibitors [PARPi]), INSIDE PC and PubMed performed similarly. For question 3 (NHT or PARPi followed by 177Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen-617), INSIDE PC outperformed PubMed for the top five, ten, and 20 publications (+16, +4, and +5 pps, respectively). Conclusions We applied INSIDE PC to develop standards for evaluating the performance of AI-based tools for literature extraction. INSIDE PC performed competitively with PubMed and can assist clinicians with therapeutic sequencing in PC. Patient summary The medical literature is often very difficult for doctors and patients to search. In this report, we describe INSIDE PC—an artificial intelligence (AI) system created to help search articles published in medical journals and determine the best order of treatments for advanced prostate cancer in a much better time frame. We found that INSIDE PC works as well as another search tool, PubMed, a widely used resource for searching and retrieving articles published in medical journals. Our work with INSIDE PC shows new ways in which AI can be used to search published articles in medical journals and how these systems might be evaluated to support shared decision-making.},

Current research reveals robust defensive approaches; however, there remains a significant gap in the application of Generative AI to develop advanced attack scenarios capable of bypassing existing defense mechanisms. Our work attempts to fill this gap and spreads awareness regarding a potential exposure of Neural Network (NN)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) against AI-enhanced attacks. Unlike conventional approaches that focus on Input Perturbation, Data Poisoning, or Spoofing, we propose a novel offensive strategy called Attack Obfuscation. This strategy leverages Conditional GANs (CGANs) to conceal genuine attacks by injecting synthetic traffic designed to deceive NN-based IDS. The experimental investigation validates the proposed approach against three distinct datasets and different typologies of attacks, managing to successfully deceive the IDS.},

The systematic search comprised articles in the Scopus database, from 2000 to 2023. The results from 48 articles show that AI has been applied mainly to predict compressive strength and slump. Comparing the AI techniques to their R2, no clear trend was observed, i.e., there was no overall best algorithm; and their performance was not directly related to database size. Still, Random Forest obtained superior results in articles that compared multiple techniques. Some of the main gaps identified are the lack of studies with geopolymers synthesized in acidic environments or with waste-based or nanomaterials; and that AI has not been largely applied to properties besides compressive strength (e.g., fire resistance, durability, porosity, and thermal properties). Regarding transparency, authors have seldom publicized their codes, impairing proper review of the models. In conclusion, if properly and ethically adopted, AI is a promising tool for the development of geopolymer composites, which can optimize time and employee resources; and many applications remain unexplored.},

The major frameworks are focused on identifying content and technical knowledge (AI literacy). Most of the current definitions of AI literacy for a non-technical audience are developed from an engineering perspective and may not be appropriate for K–12 education. Teacher perspectives are essential to making sense of this initiative. Literacy is about knowing (knowledge, what skills); competency is about applying the knowledge in a beneficial way (confidence, how well). They are strongly related. This study goes beyond knowledge (AI literacy), and its two main goals are to (i) define AI literacy and competency by adding the aspects of confidence and self-reflective mindsets, and (ii) propose a more comprehensive framework for K–12 AI education. These definitions are needed for this emerging and disruptive technology (e.g., ChatGPT and Sora, generative AI). We used the definitions and the basic curriculum design approaches as the analytical framework and teacher perspectives. Participants included 30 experienced AI teachers from 15 middle schools. We employed an iterative co-design cycle to discuss and revise the framework throughout four cycles. The definition of AI competency has five abilities that take confidence into account, and the proposed framework comprises five key components: technology, impact, ethics, collaboration, and self-reflection. We also identify five effective learning experiences to foster abilities and confidences, and suggest five future research directions: prompt engineering, data literacy, algorithmic literacy, self-reflective mindset, and empirical research.},

To ensure the successful use of this technology, acceptance is paramount. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology with the potential to enhance the functionality of SR and promote user acceptance by further improving human-robot interaction. Objective We present a protocol for a scoping review of the literature on the implementation of generative AI in SR in the health care sector. The aim of this scoping review is to map out the intersection of SR and generative AI in the health care sector; to explore if generative AI is applied in SR in the health care sector; to outline which models of generative AI and SR are used for these implementations; and to explore whether user acceptance is reported as an outcome following these implementations. This scoping review supports future research by providing an overview of the state of connectedness of 2 emerging technologies and by mapping out research gaps. Methods We follow the methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley and the recommendations by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Our protocol was drafted using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). We will conduct a systematic literature search of the online databases MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore, aiming to retrieve relevant data items via tabular data charting from references meeting specific inclusion criteria which are studies published from 2010 onwards, set in the health care sector, focusing on SR with physical bodies and implemented generative AI. There are no restrictions on study types. Results will be categorized, clustered, and summarized using tables, graphs, visual representations, and narratives. Results After conducting a preliminary search and deduplication in the second quarter of 2024, we retrieved 3176 preliminary results. This scoping review will be supplemented with the next methodological steps, including retrieving the results in a reference management tool as well as screening titles, abstracts, and full text regarding specific inclusion criteria. The completion of these steps is scheduled for the second quarter of 2025. Limitations based on the heterogeneity of the included studies and the general breadth of a scoping review compared to a systematic review are to be expected. To reduce bias, we adopted a system of dual reviews and thorough documentation of the study selection. Conclusions The conducted preliminary search implies that there are a sufficient number of heterogeneous references to complete this scoping review.

Furthermore, these conventional techniques are vulnerable to human bias, which increases the risk of misdiagnosis. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI)-based analytical strategies substantially overcome these limitations using machine and deep learning methodologies. Furthermore, AI can autonomously annotate, measure, and evaluate cardiac function, significantly minimising human error, while enhancing diagnostic precision and reliability. In addition, AI can quickly process extensive volumes of imaging data and efficiently quantify cardiovascular pathological features, thereby improving the efficacy and accuracy of cardiovascular disease diagnosis. AI is widely applied in various areas of cardiac echocardiography, including image classification, disease screening, and automated measurements.

AI data-driven methodologies have transformative potential for decision-making and policymaking in urban governance. However, a gap exists between AI’s theoretical promises and its practical integration into governance frameworks. While smart cities highlight technological advancements, they also expose socio-political challenges such as inclusivity, ethics, and public trust. This study systematically reviews literature on AI adoption in urban planning and governance, examining decision-making advancements and the socio-political dimensions of AI integration. Unlike previous studies, our review connects technological innovation with governance contexts, offering a nuanced analysis of AI’s role in urban systems. The findings show that AI research in urban governance is concentrated in Europe, North America, and Asia, with Africa and Central America being underrepresented. Since 2020, AI research has surged due to smart city initiatives but remains mostly theoretical with limited practical applications in urban governance. Additionally, AI’s integration with public administration and urban studies is minimal, raising concerns about equity and transparency in algorithmic decision-making. By identifying these gaps and challenges, this study provides actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and researchers.

  abstract = {The ongoing revolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the building industry by enhancing operational efficiency, productivity, and user-centered performance. However, AI technologies in building engineering remains uneven, particularly in sectors with lower digital maturity. This study investigates the influential external factors that drive the acceptance of AI technologies in the building industry through a Meta-Analytic Structural Equation Modeling. The analysis reveals that perceived usefulness plays a mediating role (β = 0.812, p < 0.01) between external factors and stakeholders’ intention to adopt AI solutions. Notably, personal factors (β = 0.686, p < 0.01) significantly influence the perception of AI’s usefulness, thereby shaping stronger adoption intentions. Model fit indices also have been included to reflect the robustness of the structural relationships (CFI = 0.741; RMSEA = 0.042). The findings provide guidance for practitioners and policymakers aiming to accelerate AI integration in building environments. These are influential factors that foster user readiness, increase hedonic motivation, and reduce technology-related anxiety to support effective and sustainable AI transition. It should be noted, however, that the majority of included studies originate from East Asia. While this reflects the regional focus of current research efforts, it may introduce a potential regional bias.},

Neurosurgery can benefit from artificial intelligence in surgical planning, predicting patient outcomes, and analyzing neuroimaging data. GPT-4, an updated language model with additional training parameters, has exhibited exceptional performance on standardized exams. This study examines GPT-4’s competence on neurosurgical board-style questions, comparing its performance with medical students and residents, to explore its potential in medical education and clinical decision-making. Methods GPT-4’s performance was examined on 643 Congress of Neurological Surgeons Self-Assessment Neurosurgery Exam (SANS) board-style questions from various neurosurgery subspecialties. Of these, 477 were text-based and 166 contained images. GPT-4 refused to answer 52 questions that contained no text. The remaining 591 questions were inputted into GPT-4, and its performance was evaluated based on first-time responses. Raw scores were analyzed across subspecialties and question types, and then compared to previous findings on Chat Generative pre-trained transformer performance against SANS users, medical students, and neurosurgery residents. Results GPT-4 attempted 91.9% of Congress of Neurological Surgeons SANS questions and achieved 76.6% accuracy. The model’s accuracy increased to 79.0% for text-only questions. GPT-4 outperformed Chat Generative pre-trained transformer (P < 0.001) and scored highest in pain/peripheral nerve (84%) and lowest in spine (73%) categories. It exceeded the performance of medical students (26.3%), neurosurgery residents (61.5%), and the national average of SANS users (69.3%) across all categories. Conclusions GPT-4 significantly outperformed medical students, neurosurgery residents, and the national average of SANS users. The mode’s accuracy suggests potential applications in educational settings and clinical decision-making, enhancing provider efficiency, and improving patient care.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper will view the rise of the e-patient, who is “equipped, enabled, empowered, and engaged” through the lens of the evolution of successive digital technology innovations, each building on its predecessors, creating new tools for patient empowerment. We begin with the dawn of the web and the proliferation of health websites and discuss the use of digital communication tools. We then discuss the adoption of electronic health records, which enabled the rise of patient portals. This digitization of health data, along with the rapid adoption of mobile internet access and the proliferation of health-related smartphone apps, in turn, provided a platform for patients to coproduce health care by contributing their own health data to their self-care and health care. The exchange of health information between patients and providers has also been facilitated by telehealth or telemedicine technology, which enables direct care delivery. The use of social networks in health, in use since the early days of the web, has expanded since COVID-19, when public health authorities worldwide, as well as patients, sought the use of social media channels to get connected and share information. Most recently, artificial intelligence and large language models have emerged with yet untapped potential to provide patients with the information that could improve their understanding of their conditions and treatment options. We conclude that innovations in digital health technology have symbiotically evolved with the ascendance of the e-patient, enabling improved communication, collaboration, and coordination between patients and clinicians and forging a health care system that is safer and more responsive to patient needs.},

However, existing literature suggests deficiencies in applying analytical reasoning skills in healthcare education. As CT integration gains momentum in dentistry, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies introduces new dynamics. This article explores the potential impacts of emerging technologies of AI on the development and application of CT in the dental profession. Methods A narrative literature review of English-language publications was conducted using sources such as PubMed, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Wiley-Online-Library, and Oral-Health-Group. Our review focused on relevant articles published up to June 30,2024, representing a peak period of CT awareness. The search terms used included: “Critical thinking,” “healthcare,” “rubric,” “dental education,” and “Artificial intelligence.” No inclusion or exclusion criteria were applied. The search strategies aimed to synthesize collective healthcare experience in implementing CT in education, providing a cohesive understanding of the current state of CT and highlighting gaps in its integration in education. Results Strategies for incorporating CT into dental education are still developing. Although dental educators recognize the importance of CT-based curricula, barriers hinder effective implementation. Additionally, the rise of advanced technologies with human-like cognitive and non-cognitive capabilities necessitates agile, adaptable strategies to integrate CT in dental education. A simplified model is proposed for integrating AI into the development of CT skills at multiple levels in dental education. Furthermore, a rubric for assessing CT skills in problem-based learning is presented. Conclusion This review emphasizes the urgent need to strategically prioritize CT integration in dental education. Inadequate application of CT may increase the risk of AI misuse, and overreliance on AI could potentially undermine clinical decision-making. We propose that emerging technologies should be embraced as tools to enhance the development of CT skills while mitigating potential negative impacts.
