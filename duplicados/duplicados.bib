  abstract = {The development and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) have brought numerous problems and potential threats, such as information cocoons, algorithmic collusion, algorithmic bias and privacy, issues. To combat these issues, governments all over the world, international organizations and giant tech companies all have taken actions and reached an agreement that AI should be trusted. However, there is no uniform definition on trusted AI. In the paper, we make a survey on related works on artificial intelligence principles and ethical guidelines. Then analyze the ethical foundations of trusted AI and give a definition on trusted AI. We propose specific requirements of trusted AI from a technical perspective and give explanations on these technique requirements. Finally, best practices are recommended to achieve trusted AI and promote the responsible use of AI.},

  abstract = {<p>Defining Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not easy as AI is a young discipline. However, the field of AI got officially defined in 1956 with a workshop organized by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project. The goal of this conference was to investigate ways in which machines could be made to simulate aspects of intelligence. In 1965, computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, an early conversational AI program capable of natural language interaction. Though intended to showcase the superficiality of communication between humans and artificial intelligence, ELIZA's uncannily human&#x2010;like responses led many to curiously anthropomorphize its underlying system. The possibility to use massive volumes of data changed everything and triggered a new boom supported by the Big Data era, the access to large amounts of data, cheaper and faster computers, and progress on machine learning.</p>},

  abstract = {Summary <p>The accelerated pace of the implementation of AI in architecture has given rise to a fascinating field of inquiry, demanding rigorous examination and investigation. One of the most significant advantages of incorporating AI into architecture is the ability to expand the human mind's creative capabilities. AI tools and algorithms offer architects access to a vast repository of data, design precedents and advanced computational capabilities, enabling them to generate innovative ideas and solutions. By considering the values and narratives embedded within architecture's cultural and historical contexts, designers can craft more inclusive, meaningful and people&#x2010;centred designs that resonate with the diverse communities they serve. To that end, machine learning, deep learning and other concepts that are subsumed under the umbrella term &#x2018;artificial intelligence&#x2019; can help designers explore the large data vaults of culture in order to inform, expand and enrich the design space of architecture.</p>},

  abstract = {The growing integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in traditional search interfaces is transforming how consumers search for information online. When AI-generated summaries are at the forefront without allowing users to opt out, their search experience becomes less user-driven and more system-controlled. Yet, its impact on consumer switching intentions is underexplored. Grounded in consumer empowerment and psychological reactance theories, this mixed-method research investigates how the lack of a choice feature to opt out of AI integration drives consumer switching intentions. Analyzing real-world discussions on Reddit, followed by an experiment, our findings reveal that when users lack the choice to disable AI-generated content, they feel less empowered, more intrusive, and irritated, increasing their likelihood of switching. Our findings extend interface design literature by identifying “choice to opt out of AI feature” as a critical design element for GenAI interfaces. While previous research has primarily theorized consumer empowerment in AI-enabled interfaces by focusing on autonomy, power, and control, our findings advance this literature by empirically demonstrating consumer choice as a novel and critical antecedent of empowerment. Further, we contribute to psychological reactance theory by extending it to a permanent, system-level disruption and demonstrate that the scale and permanence of reactance drive switching intentions. We provide actionable recommendations for interface designers to incorporate a toggle switch into GenAI interfaces, enabling users to choose to disable AI features. It suggests that managers may use empowerment as a strategic differentiator of interfaces to prevent consumers from migrating to alternative interfaces.},

This review critically examines recent advancements in the application of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence for optimizing thermal energy systems, including solar collectors, heat exchangers, and latent heat storage units. Nanotechnology (particularly the use of nano-enhanced phase change materials and nanofluids such as Al₂O₃ and CuO) has shown to improve thermal conductivity by up to 28.8 %, accelerating energy absorption and storage rates. Concurrently, artificial intelligence algorithms, especially artificial neural networks and particle swarm optimization, enable predictive modelling, real-time system control, and fault detection, with some models achieving prediction accuracies above 97 % under complex operational conditions. The review emphasizes the synergistic potential of combining these technologies to create intelligent, self-regulating thermal energy systems. However, the paper also identifies critical challenges including computational overhead, cost of nanoparticle synthesis, lack of reproducibility in artificial intelligence implementations, and insufficient validation under extreme scenarios. Commercial deployment case studies (such as artificial intelligence-driven phase change material-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in smart buildings) are discussed to illustrate practical viability, reporting energy savings of up to 28 % with return-on-investment periods under three years. The paper concludes by proposing integrated research directions that combine multiscale material innovation with robust artificial intelligence training on dynamic datasets.

Promising AI applications used for accomplishing diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tasks are being developed at a high pace. This is notably true in thoracic oncology, given the significant and rapid therapeutic progress made recently for lung cancer patients. Advances have been based on drugs targeting molecular alterations, immunotherapies, and, more recently antibody-drug conjugates which are soon to be introduced. For over a decade, many proof-of-concept studies have explored the use of AI algorithms in thoracic oncology to improve lung cancer patient care. However, despite the enthusiasm in this domain, the set-up and use of AI algorithms in daily practice of thoracic pathologists has not been operative until now, due to several constraints. The purpose of this review is to describe the potential but also the current barriers of AI applications in routine thoracic pathology for non-small cell lung cancer patient care and to suggest practical solutions for rapid future implementation.},

A total of 50 scientific texts published between 2018 and 2023 were analyzed and selected after a rigorous search of specialized databases. These findings confirm the versatility of UTAUT2 in elucidating technological adoption processes in higher education. Performance expectancy and hedonic motivation emerged as significant predictors of intentions and effective use among students, faculty, and administrative staff. Among students, perceived ease of use and social influence were also relevant. The analysis revealed differences in adoption patterns between STEM and non-STEM disciplines and between public and private institutions. Despite widespread positive perceptions of AI's potential, barriers such as distrust and lack of knowledge persist. The research also identified moderating and mediating factors, such as prior technology experience and technological self-efficacy. These results have important implications for the implementation of AI in higher education, suggesting the need for differentiated approaches according to the characteristics of each group and institutional context. It is recommended to develop strategies that address the identified barriers and leverage facilitators, with an emphasis on training, ethical design, and contextual adaptation of AI applications. Future research should explore the longitudinal evolution of these factors and examine AI adoption in non-STEM disciplines in greater depth.},

We developed and investigated an integrated framework combining comprehensive generative AI literacies—functional, critical and ethical, and creative—with self-regulated learning (SRL) processes operationalized as a human-centered Plan, Iterate, Evaluate cycle. Thirty-eight undergraduate students enrolled in an “Artificial Intelligence and Writing” course completed scaffolded experiential challenges followed by self-directed creative projects. Quantitative analysis revealed significant growth in AI literacy self-efficacy across all dimensions, with students progressing from moderate initial confidence (M = 4.68, SD = 2.11) to high confidence levels (M = 8.39, SD = 1.04) on a 10-point scale (t = −9.86, p < .001). Qualitative analysis of project artifacts and student process reflections identified a taxonomy of human in the loop practices integrating AI literacies and self-regulation across the Plan, Iterate, Evaluate cycle. Planning practices involved activating domain knowledge to identify AI applications and establishing evaluative criteria. Iteration practices included developing multi-step workflows, refining prompts through dialogue, and monitoring output quality. Evaluation practices combined assessment of project outcomes with reflection on collaboration processes to inform future use. These practices illustrated adaptive human-AI collaboration strategies that augment rather than replace students’ disciplinary expertise and creative vision. These findings suggest scaffolded experiential learning integrating AI literacies and metacognitive processes can promote effective AI collaboration and empower students to actively direct their own learning.},

Despite changing contexts, certain obligations remain constant: scholars have an obligation to prioritize scientific and personal integrity above the pursuit of individual success, and they must ethically use research tools, including information technology search processes and writing technologies, as part of their scientific processes. The first obligation is built on personal integrity, which in turn characterizes how the second is implemented. My career spanned the last quarter of the 20th century through the first quarter of the 21st century. During this period, there were significant advancements in research methodologies, including the capability of internet search technologies to access scientific databases and desktop writing and referencing software. These advances pale in comparison to the meteoric rise of artificial intelligence large language models (AI LLMs) over the last five years, where information retrieval and writing tools have transformed how we access and use information – potentially placing our personal and authorial integrity at risk. Given this rapid transformation, my autobiography’s objectives are: 1) to share my developmental perspectives on personal and authorial integrity and examine the impact of early experiences where perceived plagiarism helped me define those principles; 2) to review professional guidelines concerning research integrity and policy recommendations for AI LLMs; 3) to discuss changes in my scholarly content resulting from evolving search strategies, writing tools, and journal growth; and 4) by using examples of AI-generated and AI-assisted writing samples, to address the influence of AI LLMs on authorial integrity, including practical risks, opportunities, and current recommended strategies for managing AI LLMs in scholarly writing. By sharing my perspectives, I hope to provide guidance for those pursuing scholarly careers that ensures their authorial integrity.},

Additionally, it investigated response consistency and the influence of text order and language on chatbot performance. Methods In this cross-sectional comparative study, eleven cases representing various pulpal and periradicular pathologies were created. These cases were presented to four chatbots (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4.0, Bard, and Bing) in both Portuguese and English, with the information order varied (signs and symptoms first or imaging data first). Statistical analyses included the Kruskal-Wallis test, Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner pairwise comparisons, simple logistic regression, and the binomial test. Results Bing and ChatGPT 4.0 achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy rates (86.4 % and 85.3 % respectively), significantly outperforming ChatGPT 3.5 (46.5 %) and Bard (28.6 %) (p < 0.001). For treatment recommendations, ChatGPT 4.0, Bing, and ChatGPT 3.5 performed similarly (94.4 %, 93.2 %, and 86.3 %, respectively), while Bard exhibited significantly lower accuracy (75 %, p < 0.001). No significant association between diagnosis and treatment accuracy was found for Bard and Bing, but a positive association was observed for ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4.0 (p < 0.05). The overall consistency rate was 98.29 %, with no significant differences related to text order or language. Cases presented in Portuguese prompted significantly more additional information requests than those in English (33.5 % vs. 10.2 %; p < 0.001), with the relevance of this information being higher in Portuguese (29.5 % vs. 8.5 %; p < 0.001). Conclusions Bing and ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy, while Bard showed the lowest accuracy in both diagnosis and treatment recommendations. However, the clinical application of these tools necessitates critical interpretation by dentists, as chatbot responses are not consistently reliable.},

Nonetheless, applying it in the clinic has been slow because of issues with the spectrum's complexity, background noise, and differences in biological samples. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into SERS has made its use for diagnostics much better by allowing automation of spectral preprocessing, noise removal, key information extraction, and accurate classification. Traditional machine learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) AI algorithms can effectively interpret complex SERS data and recognize the biomarkers specific to different diseases in non-invasive samples such as serum, saliva, urine, breath condensates, and exosomes. AI-SERS technology provides a quick, scalable way to find cancer at an early stage, classify the type of cancer, and track the effects of therapy, matching the goals of precision oncology. It clearly explains the fundamentals of SERS, AI-based techniques to signal analysis and how the two are employed together in oncology. We describe new progress toward diagnosing many cancers, assessing outcomes, and tracking how patients react to therapy. In particular, the review presents the use of AI-enhanced SERS platforms for cancers of different types, such as breast cancer (BC), lung cancer (LC), prostate cancer (PCa), skin cancer, oral cancer, gastrointestinal cancers, colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PaC), and ovarian cancer (OvCa). We also discuss how these platforms are being used for early diagnosis, monitoring treatment effects, and predicting the possibility of the disease returning. Ultimately, we discuss how key translational challenges like data standardization, the ability to explain models, and the need for approval by authorities must be dealt with before AI-SERS can be used routinely in clinical oncology.},

Ongoing AI research will enhance the in-depth development and application of FBPs. Scope and approach This review outlines the general process of AI screening for FBPs, including data foundation, molecular feature representation, machine learning and deep learning model construction and training, as well as evaluation and validation. It also summarizes recent research advances in AI screening of FBPs with different bioactivities, discusses current key issues and challenges, and highlights future research directions and trends of FBPs. Key findings and conclusions Significant advancements have been made in utilizing AI screening methods to identify functional FBPs with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, flavor-enhancing, and hypotensive properties, while the research on anti-obesity and anti-fatigue peptides is still at a nascent stage. Deep learning has demonstrated clear predictive advantages over traditional machine learning techniques. However, challenges remain when screening for peptides with different biological activities. Moving forward, data augmentation strategies should be developed within food-specific large models, and a universal deep learning framework based on multi-scale chemical space features should be created to predict peptide-target dynamic interactions.

The research employed structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to test a hypothetical model comprising five constructs: perceived ethics, bias in AI, teacher concerns, AI literacy, and AI implementation. The results revealed two significant relationships: AI literacy strongly influences AI implementation, and bias in AI significantly affects AI literacy. In contrast to expectations, perceived ethics and teacher concerns had no significant influence on AI literacy. Additionally, demographic variables (age and gender) had no moderating effects on the relationships between the constructs. The findings suggest that enhancing AI literacy and addressing algorithmic bias are crucial factors for successful AI integration in higher education, whereas ethical considerations and teacher concerns may play a less significant role than previously theorized.

However, traditional vaccine development methods face challenges in efficiency, cost, and response time to emerging pathogens. Recent progress in art AI and nanotechnology is revolutionizing this landscape, offering innovative solutions for vaccine design, delivery, and optimization. This manuscript examines the transformative impact of AI and nanotechnology on advancing vaccine development, highlighting their synergistic effect in overcoming traditional limitations. AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, facilitates rapid identification of immunogenic antigens and epitopes by analyzing vast genomic, proteomic, and immunological datasets. These computational tools optimize vaccine design by predicting antigen stability, immunogenicity, and efficacy, as exemplified by the expedited development of COVID-19 vaccines. Nanotechnology complements these advancements by providing engineered nanoparticles (NPs), including liposomes, polymeric NPs, and biomimetic systems, that enhance antigen delivery, stability, and immune activation. Innovations such as virus-like particles (VLPs) and immune-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs) further enhance vaccine safety and efficacy by mimicking natural infection processes to trigger robust, targeted immune responses. Integrating AI and nanotechnology presents remarkable opportunities for developing personalized immunization strategies. AI algorithms can assess individual immune profiles to design customized vaccines, while nanotechnology enables precise delivery and controlled release of antigens. This interdisciplinary approach accelerates vaccine development, ensuring both safety and efficacy, and lays the foundation for universal vaccines and cancer vaccines that target complex pathogens and non-infectious diseases. Together, AI and nanotechnology herald a new era in vaccinology, enabling the development of vaccines that are faster, more precise, and highly adaptable to emerging and complex health challenges.},

  abstract = {Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) enable vehicle-infrastructure communication, enhancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Vehicles interconnect wirelessly to share information. Still, this communication is vulnerable to various attacks, particularly in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) scenarios. This study proposes an Artificial Intelligence-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in an edge-envisioned environment, combining edge computing and deep learning. The approach uses the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for edge node selection to perform packet forwarding and employs a Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) for intrusion detection. This poses a challenge since regular traffic samples are typically more prevalent than anomalous traffic, and the dataset is unstructured and highly imbalanced. Our BiGAN-based model overcomes synchronization challenges between generator and discriminator networks. Training iterations increase independently until cross-entropy loss conditions are met. The trained encoder-discriminator network is a single-class classifier, distinguishing normal and abnormal data. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance on the NSL-KDD dataset compared to similar methods.},

Given the increased risk of arrhythmias and thromboembolic events in this population, AI could aid in timely correct diagnosis, reduce unnecessary consultations, tests, and minimize infection spread. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of the AI-based PMcardio application in detecting AF in COVID-19 patients. Methods The study analyzed 116 hospitalized COVID-19 consecutive patients using paper-based medical records, with a particular focus on ECGs. The presence and type of arrhythmias were determined by an experienced cardiologist and compared with assessments by the infectious disease specialists collected from patient medical records and the PMcardio application. Results The mean patient age was 63.28 (14.980) years. The PMcardio AI application demonstrated perfect diagnostic performance, achieving a sensitivity and specificity of 1.00 for AF detection compared to cardiologist's evaluations. Infectious disease specialists showed lower sensitivity (0.85) but retained high specificity (0.97). No significant association was found between the AI confidence score and diagnostic accuracy (p = 0.660), indicating consistent performance across confidence levels. Additionally, the AI's severity classification correlated significantly with rhythm diagnoses (p < 0.001). Conclusions AI-powered ECG analysis using PMcardio highly accurately detected AF in COVID-19 patients, outperforming infectious disease specialists and matching cardiologist's accuracy. The integration of AI in clinical practice may enhance arrhythmia detection and streamline diagnostic workflows, particularly in resource-limited and infectious disease settings.},

  abstract = {Background & aims Mitochondrial (mt-) D-loop and cell-free circulating (ccf-) mtDNA fragments, respectively reflecting mt-mass and tissue damage, are promising metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) biomarkers. We previously found that PNPLA3/MBOAT7/TM6SF2 deficiency in HepG2 cells increased mt-mass, D-loop levels, and ccf-COXIII release. We explored mt-biogenesis and mt-biomarkers in patients with MASLD stratified by the number of risk variants (NRV = 3). We exploited GPT-4 to develop and validate new risk scores, predicting MASLD evolution, in two independent cohorts by integrating anthropometric and genetic data with mt-biomarkers. Methods A cohort of 28 patients with MASLD (Discovery cohort) was consecutively enrolled for hepatic mt-dynamics assessment by transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Data were confirmed by quantitative real time-PCR in a retrospective cohort (Hepatic Validation, n = 184). D-loop and ccf-COXIII were retrospectively measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum samples of biopsied outpatients with MASLD (Serum Validation cohort, n = 824) and individuals with non-invasive MASLD diagnosis (n = 386, Non-invasive cohort). Risk scores were developed using random forest algorithms. Results In the Discovery and Hepatic Validation cohorts, the PNPLA3/MBOAT7/TM6SF2 variants altered hepatic mt-dynamics, enhancing mt-content and D-loop levels (p <0.05) through the p38/PGC-1α pathway. Furthermore, NRV = 3 patients showed an increase in mt-fragmentation at transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and ccf-COXIII release (p <0.05). In the Serum Validation cohort, circulating D-loop and ccf-COXIII positively correlated with genetics [βD-loop:0.17 (95% CI: 0.04–0.29), p = 0.01; βccf-COXIII:0.33 (95% CI: 0.19–0.46), p <0.0001] and MASLD severity [ORD-loop:1.31 (95% CI: 1.01-1.71), p = 0.03; ORccf-COXIII:2.41 (95% CI: 1.69-3.44), p <0.0001] at multivariate analysis. Random forest allowed prediction models named Mitochondrial, Anthropometric, and Genetic Integration with Computational intelligence for assessing hepatocellular carcinoma risk (MAGIC-H), considering age, BMI genetics, D-loop, and ccf-COXIII. In both Serum and Non-invasive cohorts, the MAGIC-H score reached AUC >85% in identifying HCC cases regardless of cirrhosis, outperforming existing non-invasive tests. Conclusions Mt-biomarkers have a prognostic significance in genetically-predisposed patients with MASLD. Impact and implications The study highlights that genetic variants in PNPLA3, MBOAT7, and TM6SF2 genes deeply contribute to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) progression by affecting hepatic mitochondrial adaptability. It also identified two novel biomarkers of mitochondrial origin which are strongly linked to disease severity and genetic background of patients with MASLD. The use of generative artificial intelligence tools, such as GPT-4, can enhance the use of biomarkers and polygenic risk scores for clinical risk stratification. We developed a customized version of GPT-4 (rsGPT-4), which identified a machine-learning approach (random forest) as the best method for creating prediction models for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The new scores combined the two mitochondrial biomarkers, genetic data, and anthropometric data and outperformed existing non-invasive tests for monitoring patients with MASLD.},

This paper redirects its focus from general brain mapping techniques to specifically investigate the impact of AI in the field of epilepsy diagnosis, concentrating exclusively on Electroencephalography (EEG) data. While earlier studies have predominantly centered on the automatic identification and prediction of seizures using EEG records, an emerging body of research delves into the potential of AI techniques to enhance the analysis of EEG data. This systematic review offers a comprehensive overview, commencing with a concise theoretical exposition on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and attention mechanisms. Subsequent sections explore the applications of AI in EEG analysis for epilepsy, covering aspects such as diagnosis, lateralization, automated lesion detection, presurgical evaluation, and the prediction of postsurgical outcomes. The discussion not only highlights the promising aspects of AI in refining clinical practices but also underscores its potential in tailoring individualized treatments for epilepsy, considering it as a network disorder. The paper concludes by addressing limitations, challenges, and proposing future directions for the application of AI in epilepsy research. While acknowledging the transformative potential of this approach, it emphasizes the necessity for greater multicenter collaboration to amass high-quality data and ensure the open accessibility of developed codes and tools. Moreover, the application of AI models in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) has exhibited significant promise in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of epilepsy and seizure diagnosis.

Setting Study respondents completed an online self-administered survey in February of 2024. Participants Disabled adults (N=335) from the Accessibility User Research Collective. Interventions None. Main Outcome Measures Disabled adults’ use and perceptions of AI in a series of contexts including current use, barriers and facilitators to use, trust of AI, and ideal future development areas of AI. Results Use of AI: Adults with disabilities use AI for communication in multiple ways, with the most used being personal virtual assistants (80.90%), followed by customer service chatbots (61.79%), and conversational generative AI (57.01%). Adults with disabilities often use AI for creativity and enhancement, with over half of disabled adults using AI via search engines (83.28%), text editing (72.24%), predictive text (69.25%), consumer recommendations (66.57%), and social media feeds (54.03%). Improve Lives: A vast majority (87.4%) of people with disabilities agreed that AI has the potential to improve the lives of people with disabilities. Trust of AI: People with disabilities have a generally neutral position on trust in relation to AI (47.7%); however, of those that trust AI (25.2%) and of those that do not trust AI (27.0%), there was a slightly higher percentage of 1.8% that distrust AI. People who trust AI note that accessibility and company reputation are key drivers of their trust, more so than people who distrust AI. People who distrust AI are more commonly driven by concerns for data privacy, news and media reports, transparency of AI decision making, and other factors than people who trust AI. The accuracy of AI and previous experiences with AI do not have a different prevalence for those who do and do not trust AI. Future AI Development Interest: 96.36% of disabled adults have an interest in future AI development, with deep interest in development for communication (71.82%), household chores and general maintenance (62.42%), health and wellness (62.12%), and hobbies/leisure activities (60.61%).

The study involved 12 surgical clerkship students completing their core rotation at a major academic medical center. The SOE-LLM, using MIMIC-IV–derived surgical cases (acute appendicitis and pancreatitis), was implemented to simulate oral examinations. Technical validation assessed performance across 8 domains: case presentation accuracy, physical examination findings, historical detail preservation, laboratory data reporting, imaging interpretation, management decisions, and recognition of contraindicated interventions. Educational utility was evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale. Results Technical validation showed the SOE-LLM’s ability to function as a consistent oral examiner. The model accurately guided students through case presentations, responded to diagnostic questions, and provided clinically sound responses based on MIMIC-IV cases. When tested with standardized prompts, it maintained examination fidelity, requiring proper diagnostic reasoning and differentiating operative versus medical management. Student evaluations highlighted the platform’s value as an examination preparation tool (mean, 4.250; SEM, 0.1794) and its ability to create a low-stakes environment for high-stakes decision practice (mean, 4.833; SEM, 0.1124).

The aging of pipelines is becoming increasingly serious, and any damage or rupture can lead to severe marine environmental pollution. Therefore, effective safety assessment methods are crucial for ensuring the safety of submarine pipelines. Traditional safety assessment methods such as Event Tree Analysis (ETA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) have been widely used but rely heavily on historical accidents. Artificial intelligence methods, particularly hybrid models, offer a more resilient alternative by combining different techniques, providing more accurate assessments even with limited data. Therefore, this study reviews the application of AI methods in the safety assessment of submarine pipelines, focusing on hybrid models that combine Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bayesian Network (BN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with other techniques. These hybrid models have shown excellent performance in detecting and predicting corrosion defects in submarine pipelines and overall safety assessment by complementing each other's strengths. Future research should focus on model integration and optimization, revealing the evolution processes of accidents, data augmentation to address data scarcity, interdisciplinary research to enhance model interpretability, and intelligent decision-making for better pipeline integrity management.},

The analysis identified six main research foci: Perceptions and attitudes, psychological and cognitive aspects, teaching and learning strategies, language skills development, writing and feedback, and implementation and integration. While higher education (86.7 %) and English as Foreign Language contexts (86.1 %) dominated the research landscape, there was notable geographical diversity, with strong representation from East Asia and emerging contributions from the Middle East. Mixed-methods approaches (38.9 %) were prevalent, with increasing incorporation of AI-generated content, multimedia recordings, and digital interaction data from 2023 to 2024. Writing emerged as the primary focus (42.4 %) while speaking, listening, and reading skills received comparatively less attention. This review highlights critical gaps, including limited research in K-12 settings, insufficient longitudinal studies, and the need for more diverse language representation beyond English. These findings suggest the field is maturing but requires broader investigation across educational levels, language domains, and geographical contexts to fully understand the impact of generative AI in language education.},
