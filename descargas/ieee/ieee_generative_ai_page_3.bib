  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology with applications across diverse domains such as education, healthcare, business, agriculture, and scientific research. This paper presents WorldLangAI, a web-based platform that leverages the power of Google's Gemini API and the gemini-1.5-flash model to facilitate real-time image-to-text translation across multiple languages and accurately convert textual content from images into desired languages. WorldLangAI functions as a dictionary bot that allows users to input images containing text in any language, then it analyzes and converts them into any desired language. WorldLangAI is a novel approach that offers a userfriendly and efficient solution for overcoming language barriers, with implications for global communication, information accessibility, and multilingual applications. This innovative solution has the potential to significantly enhance global communication with cross-cultural interactions and real-time translation for travel assistance which can translate text in images, such as signs or menus, into different languages, helping travelers navigate foreign countries. The paper discusses Generative AI, and its applications followed by Gemini 1.5 Flash and its performance comparison with other GenAI models. This paper also provides the comparative analysis of Generative AI services on various cloud platforms including Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, and Azure Open AI and their features which can be used to build and deploy Generative AI applications allowing users to experience high performance, high availability, and low latency.},

  abstract={Cancer is a multifactorial disease, associated with several alterations at various molecular levels, which provides a favorable and selective advantage for aberrant cell growth. Enormous genetic alterations in cancer can be captured through next-generation sequencing. The analysis of high-dimensional data from sequencing experiments requires a huge amount of computational power, which can be addressed using algorithms in artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML). Early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have been instrumental in clinical research due to its ability to assist clinicians to make a more informed treatment decision. The visualization of tumor growth and its genetic cause is an essential part of cancer treatment. Here, AI/ML can address this by analyzing and linking the image-derived data to genomics data from cancer patients. In this work, we present a review of recent advances in image analysis using ML/AI for cancer diagnosis and treatment. In addition to that, we have discussed the recent methods of genomic data analysis for cancer classification and biomarker discovery.},

  pages={469-473},
  abstract={While the world remains fascinated by the technology and ingenuity behind Artificial Intelligence (AI), certain drawbacks prompt us to question its impact on humanity. One major drawback encountered is bias and lack of inclusivity. Recently, there have been instances where AI systems lacked equality, equity, and honesty in their results for specific operations. Given these events and the global advancement of AI applications, it is crucial to investigate the causes of bias in deployed models. To this end, we considered the model pretraining stage as the major cause of this challenge and identified the lack of non-Western datasets as a vital reason. This research aims to promote inclusivity by providing a food images dataset from Nigeria and a deep learning classification model trained on this dataset.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, people more and more rely on generative AI (GenAI) to fulfill a variety of tasks. Thus, the popularity of AI is arousing people’s attention to AI literacy. However, few current existing studies or scientific methods can systematically summarize AI literacy systematically. Therefore, aiming to use library statistic-based clustering techniques to analyze AI literacy, this paper uses clustering to perform summarizing based on library statistic analysis rules. Subsequently, bibliometric analysis and VOSviewer visualization tools are used to conduct a comprehensive review of the academic literature in the field of AI literacy. With better parameters and rules, the summary proposed in this paper can outperform the baseline clustering models. Experimental results show that better summaries can be obtained and visualized by using our proposed method. Additionally, this study points out the limitations of the research and provides direction for improvement in subsequent studies.},

In the context of data justice, geo&#x2010;specificity refers to the understanding that data and algorithms can have different implications and impacts depending on the location and context in which they are used. In order to achieve data justice, it is essential to consider the technical aspects of data processing and artificial intelligence technology and the social, cultural, and political context in which they are used.

  abstract={The widespread use of digital systems and tools in education has opened up opportunities for collecting, measuring, and analysing data about user (learner, teacher) interactions with a variety of learning resources and activities, with the ultimate objective of better understanding learning and advancing both learning outcomes and the overall learning experience. This promise motivated the development of Learning Analytics (LA) as a research and practical field and the use of insights derived from learning trace data for evidence-based decision making in a variety of educational settings. While LA has made a significant contribution to better understanding of learning and the environments in which it takes place, many open questions and challenges remain. Furthermore, new opportunities and challenges continue to emerge with the ever-changing modalities of teaching and learning, the latest of which are associated with the rapid development and accessibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Taking the cyclical model of LA as its exploration framework, this paper examines how key components of the LA model – namely data, methods, and actions – relate to and may benefit from the latest developments in AI, and especially Generative AI. Aiming for evidence-based analysis and discussion of the interplay between LA and AI, the paper relies on the latest empirical research in LA and the related research fields of AI in Education and Educational Data Mining.},

  abstract={As we transition from the 5G epoch, a new horizon beckons with the advent of 6G, seeking a profound fusion with novel communication paradigms and emerging technological trends, bringing once-futuristic visions to life along with added technical intricacies. Although analytical models lay the foundations and offer systematic insights, we have recently witnessed a noticeable surge in research suggesting machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can efficiently deal with complex problems by complementing or replacing model-based approaches. The majority of data-driven wireless research leans heavily on discriminative AI (DAI) that requires vast real-world datasets. Unlike the DAI, Generative AI (GenAI) pertains to generative models (GMs) capable of discerning the underlying data distribution, patterns, and features of the input data. This makes GenAI a crucial asset in wireless domain wherein real-world data is often scarce, incomplete, costly to acquire, and hard to model or comprehend. With these appealing attributes, GenAI can replace or supplement DAI methods in various capacities. Accordingly, this combined tutorial-survey paper commences with preliminaries of 6G and wireless intelligence by outlining candidate 6G applications and services, presenting a taxonomy of state-of-the-art DAI models, exemplifying prominent DAI use cases, and elucidating the multifaceted ways through which GenAI enhances DAI. Subsequently, we present a tutorial on GMs by spotlighting seminal examples such as generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, flow-based GMs, diffusion-based GMs, generative transformers, large language models, autoregressive GMs, to name a few. Contrary to the prevailing belief that GenAI is a nascent trend, our exhaustive review of approximately 120 technical papers demonstrates the scope of research across core wireless research areas, including 1) physical layer design; 2) network optimization, organization, and management; 3) network traffic analytics; 4) cross-layer network security; and 5) localization & positioning. Furthermore, we outline the central role of GMs in pioneering areas of 6G network research, including semantic communications, integrated sensing and communications, THz communications, extremely large antenna arrays, near-field communications, digital twins, AI-generated content services, mobile edge computing and edge AI, adversarial ML, and trustworthy AI.

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is emerging as a transformative technology in higher education, particularly in programming instruction. However, its impact on learning, motivation, and the educational environment must still be fully understood. This study aims to determine the capacity of GenAI to generate effective computer programming learning in STEM university students, comparing it with active learning methods based on video. An experiment was conducted with 40 computer engineering students divided into two groups: one using GenAI (Google Gemini 1.5) and another employing educational videos. Pre- and post-tests of knowledge and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) were applied to evaluate learning, intrinsic motivation, and the learning environment. No significant differences in learning were found between the groups. However, GenAI significantly increased perceived autonomy and reduced perceived effort and pressure, while video-based learning significantly improved perceived competence. These findings suggest that both methods seem to motivate in diverse ways and that they could complement each other in an integrated teaching approach, offering new perspectives for designing programming learning environments in higher education.},

  abstract={In the era of digital intelligence, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into educational practices has the potential to transform traditional teaching methods. Human-machine collaborative teaching (HMCT) is a new paradigm that leverages the strengths of both human educators and AI tools to enhance learning outcomes. This study investigates the effectiveness of three human-machine collaborative teaching strategies—directive, guided, and collaborative-implemented in a university—level software engineering course. The experiment involved 99 third-year students and aimed to evaluate the impact of these teaching strategies on creativity and academic performance. The results show that the collaborative teaching method, enhanced by generative AI tools, led to the highest performance in final exams and overall academic achievement, as well as increased participation in extracurricular innovation activities in homework. While directive teaching produced consistent results, it did not foster the same level of engagement or creativity. Guided teaching demonstrated moderate success, but the greatest benefits were observed in the collaborative approach, where students took an active role in their learning. This study suggests that integrating AI into collaborative learning environments can enhance both academic outcomes and student creativity, and recommends expanding the use of AI-supported strategies in higher education. Future research should explore the scalability of these findings across disciplines and investigate long-term impacts on student development and career readiness.},

  abstract={This study focuses on the value conflicts and practical challenges arising from the application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education. Based on Weber's dual framework of instrumental rationality and value rationality, combined with Strauss's metaphor of the “second cave” the study systematically analyzes the profound impact of instrumental rationality on the essence of education. While generative AI offers significant advantages in enhancing teaching effectiveness, optimizing resource allocation, and achieving personalized learning, its overuse may lead to the prioritization of utilitarian educational goals and the mechanization of knowledge transmission. In response to this contradiction, the study proposes a “teacher-AI-student” triadic interaction model, emphasizing that the application of technology should adhere to the principles of assistive, transparent, and inclusive use. Innovatively, the study constructs a differentiated educational strategy based on the “learning ability-willingness matrix”, providing precise personalized support for different learners. In the process of digital transformation in education, it is crucial to fully leverage technological advantages while steadfastly adhering to the humanistic values, thereby achieving a dynamic balance between instrumental rationality and value rationality. The study has important theoretical value and practical significance in advancing educational innovation, deepening educational practice reforms, and building a sustainable technology-empowered education model.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education, offering students new opportunities for learning and research. However, concerns about the potential for AI to produce inaccurate or misleading information—commonly referred to as "hallucinations"—have raised questions about the impact of these tools on student learning and academic integrity. This research paper examines how students' awareness of AI tools, the types of academic tasks they are assigned, faculty support, and institutional policies influence their perceptions and attitudes toward the use of generative AI for academic purposes. The study utilized a descriptive-correlational design, guided by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which provides insights into how users accept and effectively utilize technology. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed as a robust statistical technique to analyze the impact of various factors on college students' perceptions and attitudes regarding the use of generative AI for academic work. The study's constructs were assessed for reliability and validity using Cronbach's Alpha, Average Variance Extracted (AVE), and the Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio. The findings indicate that the complexity and intensity of academic tasks, students' engagement with generative AI platforms, and the support they receive from educational stakeholders significantly influence their attitudes toward using these platforms for academic assignments. Conversely, students' perceptions of generative AI are heavily shaped by the support systems available to them and their understanding of the potential risks associated with using such technologies for their assignments and projects. This research contributes to the ongoing discussion about the ethical and practical implications of AI in education, providing valuable insights into best practices for integrating AI technologies to enhance learning while upholding academic integrity.},

  abstract={Technological change drives a constant cycle of adaptation in learning systems, especially within Engineering Education and ICT fields. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduces both challenges and opportunities for improving educational processes. This article presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of 51 peer-reviewed articles from the Web of Science and Scopus databases, covering the period from January 2021 to February 2025. The review investigates data-driven approaches combined with AI across four educational domains: learning, teaching, assessment, and academic administration. Results show that assessment is the most frequently targeted area, particularly through predictive modeling. However, there is a critical need for AI architectures that support Task-specific cognitive analysis. The limited adoption of mixed-methods research raises concerns about bias and restricts deeper pedagogical understanding. Advancing digital transformation in higher education requires aligning AI integration, data governance, and learning analytics with pedagogical models grounded in social justice and equity. The study concludes by highlighting the potential of Generative AI to enhance the interpretability of analytics and foster intelligent, inclusive educational ecosystems. These findings provide valuable guidance for decision-makers seeking to implement digital learning products through evidence-based, data-driven strategies.},

  abstract={Over the past few decades, immersive technologies have completely transformed the world around us. Recent trends show that the next digital transformation will directly impact the way people live, communicate, work, trade and learn and will be powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Generative artificial intelligence has had to face significant higher education challenges since its appearance, requiring the development of new and innovative teaching and learning practices. Nevertheless, the assimilation of such immersive technologies necessarily brings with it many challenges, advantages, and risks, which have led to differing opinions among educators, students, and academics. This paper provides a preliminary reflection on the risks and benefits that higher education students perceive in the formal use of this type of tool for academic purposes. An exit survey was used to verify the initial opinions of the students, obtaining almost 90 percent of positive perceptions, but only considering AI as a support tool. In contrast, a significant percentage mentioned that there could be some risks in using this technology: dependency on AI tools, loss of creativity and plagiarism according to institutional policies. Despite its innovative and significant importance, the students acknowledge that the tool is imperfect and accept several disadvantages, such as incorrect answers, poor quality references and the production of unsafe content, so its use must regulate and for now remain only as a complementary support tool.},

  abstract={Computer science has recently experienced a surge in popularity with the release of generative artificial intelligence models. Yet, while the popular imagination has been captured, evidence indicates that pre-college students, especially those from underrepresented populations, lack adequate education about careers in the field. Effective methods for gaining understanding include shadowing professionals or acquiring internships, yet these means are often not attainable or realistic for many students. Overall, this insufficient education can lead to future disadvantages, including future workforce disparities. To address these problems, Computer Science Next (CSNext) is an organization that was founded in early 2024 to convey insights from the current to the next generation of computer scientists. CSNext's first project will be a series of video interviews with leaders in artificial intelligence intended for a high school student audience. Video interviews will be released for free, and responses will be synthesized to share meaningful and insightful commonalities and responses. In addition, a list of the resources discussed in the interview will be cataloged alongside the videos and indexed for the site in its entirety. Particular attention will be focused on inclusivity, including underrepresented minorities, when selecting interview candidates.},

  abstract={With the rapid growth of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), we began to see the rise of deepfake content. This study aims to answer how exposure to GAI deep-fake content impacts digital consumers in psychological, social, and behavioral aspects, and how these impacts are represented in the literature, as well as to expose the potential social implications that GAI deepfake content has through a systematic literature review. The systematic literature review is done by summarizing 30 relevant articles from 2019 to 2024 that were methodically selected. VOSviewer is then used to create visualizations using the extracted data to help synthesize answers for the research question. The result of this study shows that the impact GAI deepfake content has is pre-dominantly negative, contributing to misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda. The research also identifies that deepfake is a relatively new technology that is ever-evolving, indicating that further research is needed.},

This study presents an architectural framework that combines these technologies to improve decision making in systems. Through case studies we explore how integrating AI with RL enhances performance in real world applications. By incorporating RL strategies, our approach ensures parameter settings and successful operation of the AI model leading to results. This framework can be applied in multiple software applications like information synthesis and creative simulation. Despite challenges like training instability and limited resources that generative models face, our research recognises the potential that this approach can effectively addess these issues. Our innovative framework uses RL techniques to improve the models performance during training. The results suggest that combining RL with AI not overcomes existing limitations but also opens up possibilities, for data driven applications.

  abstract={The near field scanning method specified in the international standard IEC-61967 is an important international diagnostic method for detecting electromagnetic compatibility problems. The near-field probe, as an important part of near-field scanning, mainly detects the magnetic field or electric field. The measurement accuracy of the near field probe directly affects the measurement accuracy of the electromagnetic field on the surface of the device, affecting the accuracy of electromagnetic compatibility diagnostics. To ensure measurement accuracy, it is essential to carry out near-field probe calibration. In this work, we proposed an artificial intelligence probe calibration method based on the generative adversarial networks, which helps improve the difference of calibration parts’ quality difference measurement field and eliminate the unnecessary influence field on the probe performance. Based on the proposed method, we effectively calibrate two kinds of electric field probes, which overcomes the problem of the difference of calibration parts’ quality difference measurement field, and eliminate the influence of unnecessary field to the probe performance.},

For far too long, leaders have focused on developing technology and AI at the expense of human intelligence &#x2013; and even humanity itself. Ultimately, AI represents a pinnacle of technological advancement. Headlines abound about how AI is coming for most workers today, with many experts projecting profound job loss. The leadership model of the future will be grounded in behaviors that help to develop human skills and create environments that promote human flourishing, despite and because of the increased role of AI. To stay ahead in the digital age, leaders will not only have to upskill workers, especially those considered gray&#x2010;collar, but redefine what it means to engage a workforce with an increased say and growing expectations for leaders themselves.</p>},

  abstract={As an important artistic creation form and national heritage, painting shows the features of human culture and conveys human thoughts and feelings through beautiful forms of expression, which is a unique form of human understanding of the world. Image generation algorithm is actually the transformation from one image to another, and image synthesis is an important research direction in the field of computer vision. In this paper, the AI (artificial intelligence) art image synthesis algorithm based on generation model is studied. By studying the development of GAN (Generative Adversary Networks), this paper proposes an AI art image synthesis algorithm based on GAN. An hourglass-shaped CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with layer hopping connection is designed, which consists of coding and decoding. By adding corresponding interval convolution layers, the underlying texture information of the image is preserved, and the identity loss is maintained, so that the original image and the generated image are consistent in color. The results show that all three CNN models have high recognition accuracy for data sets, and the recognition accuracy for both data sets is higher than 99%. The algorithm in this paper is superior to other comparison algorithms in RMSE and PSNR. Experimental results show that this method improves the quality of generated images.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the augmented responsibility of human Artificial Intelligence experts in the era of empowered pre-made Artificial Intelligence (AI). The responsible and ethical use of pre-made AI is of paramount importance in this evolving technology. AI systems have the potential to impact numerous aspects of society, ranging from healthcare and finance to education and IoT. The decisions made by AI algorithms can have significant consequences for individuals, communities, and even entire industries. Using a comparison to the way widely available medicines require a prescription from medical doctors, human AI experts assume the role of evaluating, recommending, and overseeing the implementation of AI systems, even when pre-built AI solutions may seem user-friendly on the surface. The paper has explored the expanded responsibilities of human AI experts within two contemporary scenarios involving pre-made AI, encompassing LLMs and ChatGPT. These AI technologies are applied in two principal manners: initially, as standalone AI products readily accessible to a wide audience, and secondly, as elements undergoing exploration for integration into other AI-driven software and Intelligent Information Systems (IIS), with the goal of enhancing natural language processing (NLP) features within user interfaces. In all cases, the expertise of human AI professionals is indispensable, and their role is augmented. These professionals bear an increased responsibility for ensuring the responsible and ethical deployment of AI technologies, with a focus on human-centered design, bias mitigation, validation and accuracy estimation of the results, transparency promotion, and the necessary balance between automation and human oversight.

  abstract={The advancement of digital technologies has introduced significant challenges to educational systems, affecting both primary and higher education institutions. While the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital tools in education, the transformation largely remained superficial, focusing primarily on converting materials to digital formats and conducting virtual classes rather than implementing comprehensive digital pedagogical reform. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence technologies has introduced both unprecedented opportunities and complex challenges to educational environments, potentially exacerbating existing systemic issues. These AI-powered tools offer substantial benefits, including customized learning experiences, real-time analysis of student responses, and streamlined administrative processes. However, students have rapidly adopted these technologies independently, often utilizing them for various academic purposes without proper guidance. Despite the transformative potential of generative AI and its widespread availability, educational institutions have been slow to develop comprehensive responses to this technological shift. A significant gap exists in quality resources that would enable educators to effectively harness these tools while maintaining a balanced perspective on their capabilities and limitations. Furthermore, there are insufficient professional development opportunities focused on helping teachers guide students and parents in understanding and appropriately using these emerging technologies. This study, conducted in late 2024, investigates the current state of AI tool adoption among educators, examining their classroom applications, implementation challenges, and overall experiences. The research aims to provide insights into how teaching professionals are currently engaging with generative AI technologies and to identify the barriers they face in effectively integrating these tools into their pedagogical practice.},

We conducted user experiments to compare the design quality and efficiency of advanced design methods with that of junior designers. The conclusion is advanced intelligent design methods are comparable with junior designers on painting. Besides, intelligent design uses only 10% of the time spent by the junior designer in the tasks of layout design, color matching, and video editing.},

  abstract={With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), a lot of spheres in life and work have been introduced to a new stage, and English literature cannot be an exception here. It proposes an investigatory research paper that tries to unmask the intersections between AI technologies and literary creativity, delving into how, in fact, such digital novelties are turning the scenery of English literature upside down. This paper will, at first, make an attempt to give some sort of comprehensive overview of the current state of AI technologies. Among the AI tools and algorithms, it is the special attention of somehow making their applications within the realm of literary creation, analysis, and interpretation. The core of these studies plunges into the details of what AI has to do with generating literary content, be it through algorithms writing poems, short stories, and even novels in the style of famous authors or totally from scratch. This study expands the scope of consideration to the collaborative processes between human authors and AI, focusing on synergetic potential for creative exploration and emergence of hybrid authorial identities. In addition, implications of the use of AI in literary analysis were described due to the fact that it is being applied to reveal new critical insights into classic texts using machine-learning models, predicting the future direction of literature, and even critiquing—again using a similar style generator—works of literature with a degree of insight thought previously exclusive to human scholars. Another important focus area will be the pedagogical implications for integrating AI into English literature education.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) can be broadly described as an artificial intelligence system capable of generating images, text, and other media types with human prompts. GAI models like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Bard have recently caught the attention of industry and academia equally. GAI applications span various industries like art, gaming, fashion, and healthcare. In healthcare, GAI shows promise in medical research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and is already making strides in real-world deployments. There has yet to be any detailed study concerning the applications and scope of GAI in healthcare. Addressing this research gap, we explore several applications, real-world scenarios, and limitations of GAI in healthcare. We examine how GAI models like ChatGPT and DALL-E can be leveraged to aid in the applications of medical imaging, drug discovery, personalized patient treatment, medical simulation and training, clinical trial optimization, mental health support, healthcare operations and research, medical chatbots, human movement simulation, and a few more applications. Along with applications, we cover four real-world healthcare scenarios that employ GAI: visual snow syndrome diagnosis, molecular drug optimization, medical education, and dentistry. We also provide an elaborate discussion on seven healthcare-customized LLMs like Med-PaLM, BioGPT, DeepHealth, etc.,Since GAI is still evolving, it poses challenges like the lack of professional expertise in decision making, risk of patient data privacy, issues in integrating with existing healthcare systems, and the problem of data bias which are elaborated on in this work along with several other challenges. We also put forward multiple directions for future research in GAI for healthcare.},

  abstract={Utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in medical imaging has completely changed how early disease screening is done, leading to big gains in accuracy, speed, and patient results. This essay looks at how AI can improve medical images. It focuses on deep learning algorithms, computer vision, and machine learning models that can make complicated diagnosis tasks easier to do automatically. These technologies make it possible to find and study small trends in medical pictures that a person might miss. This helps doctors make faster and more accurate diagnoses, especially in cancer, heart, and neurology. AI can find problems in X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and its performance is on par with or even better than that of expert doctors. The paper also looks at how AI can be used to predict diseases by looking at old image data along with clinical factors. Researchers are looking at techniques like reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to see if they can improve picture quality and help make fake data for rare diseases. This will help make diagnosis tools that are more accurate. The study also shows how AI is becoming more and more important for solving problems like inconsistent data, picture noise, and wrong interpretations. As healthcare continues to go digital, adding AI to medical imaging systems could help with personalized treatment plans, lower the number of mistakes made during diagnosis, and speed up work processes.},

  abstract={This work-in-progress innovative practice paper describes a novel integration of Generative AI with Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs). CUREs integrate research activities into the curriculum, allowing all students in a course to participate in inquiry-based research projects. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are advanced AI designed to generate human-like responses by processing natural language inputs. These applications leverage machine learning models to produce outputs that can assist users in a variety of tasks from writing to coding. The integration of Generative AI with CURE had been adopted in a text-based machine learning course during the Fall 2023 semester. A comparative analysis had been conducted on student survey responses from Fall 2022 and Fall 2023 to evaluate the effectiveness of Generative AI in a CURE integrated course. Descriptive statistics and statistical tests were conducted to assess differences in student perceptions between the two semesters. Although the differences were not statistically significant, the results indicate a promising trend towards improved student perceptions of both the overall course effectiveness and the benefits of Generative AI in enhancing various aspects of the research process, especially the literature review.},

AI's impact on the field of fine arts focuses on three main areas including machine learning analysis for artwork understanding along with AI-generated art production as well as deep learning approaches for artwork restoration. Experimental studies analyze how AI performs regarding artwork restoration precision as well as artistic coherence maintaining and conservation speed while proving that AI improves upon traditional restoration techniques in terms of precision and scalability. The authentication of AI art creates ethics tests so do biases in databases and issues about cultural preservation. The paper presents the human-AI collaborative model which demonstrates AI functions as a creative enhancement instead of replacing artists. This study delivers a detailed view of AI's changes in artistic practices through research of present-day uses as well as hurdles and upcoming strategies. These findings enhance research about AI and human artistic collaboration by helping both technology development and ethical considerations related to artistic preservation.},

  abstract={The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed natural language processing (NLP) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications. However, deploying these transformer-based models in resource-constrained environments poses a significant challenge due to their high computational and memory demands. To address this, we introduce in this article generative AI (GenAI) on the Edge, a comprehensive benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs deployed on edge devices. Leveraging a distributed testbed of Raspberry Pi 5 devices orchestrated with lightweight Kubernetes (K3s), the dataset captures a broad range of performance metrics essential for assessing the feasibility of local inference in constrained environments. These metrics include detailed measurements of throughput, inference latency, memory utilization, and computational efficiency, along with granular timing data for key stages of the inference pipeline—sample, prefill, and decode phases. We systematically evaluate LLMs of varying sizes under real-world deployment scenarios, with a particular emphasis on CPU-based edge platforms. By conducting multiple runs of conversation-based evaluations, GenAI on the Edge provides actionable insights into the tradeoffs between performance and resource efficiency, enabling better decision-making for LLM deployment in edge environments.

  abstract={The capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) evolve rapidly and affect almost all sectors of society. AI has been increasingly integrated into criminal and harmful activities, expanding existing vulnerabilities, and introducing new threats. This article reviews the relevant literature, reports, and representative incidents which allows to construct a typology of the malicious use and abuse of systems with AI capabilities. The main objective is to clarify the types of activities and corresponding risks. Our starting point is to identify the vulnerabilities of AI models and outline how malicious actors can abuse them. Subsequently, we explore AI-enabled and AI-enhanced attacks. While we present a comprehensive overview, we do not aim for a conclusive and exhaustive classification. Rather, we provide an overview of the risks of enhanced AI application, that contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the issue. Specifically, we suggest four types of malicious abuse of AI (integrity attacks, unintended AI outcomes, algorithmic trading, membership inference attacks) and four types of malicious use of AI (social engineering, misinformation/fake news, hacking, autonomous weapon systems). Mapping these threats enables advanced reflection of governance strategies, policies, and activities that can be developed or improved to minimize risks and avoid harmful consequences. Enhanced collaboration among governments, industries, and civil society actors is vital to increase preparedness and resilience against malicious use and abuse of AI.},

  abstract={Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are a strategic sector in the economy that requires continuous innovation in digital marketing strategies. As the need for attractive, professional, and easily accessible promotional content increases, generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) technology is a potential solution to support the efficiency and quality of visual design. This study explores how design thinking and generative AI can be used to create attractive and professional visual content. This study uses a design thinking method with seven stages including understand, observe, define point of view, ideate, prototype, test, and reflect. Each step uses specific tools such as persona profile canvas, feedback capture grids, and retrospective boards, as well as generative AI tools used in prototypes such as Canva AI, Prome AI, Leonardo AI and others to create faster and more optimal designs. The results of the study show that the use of AI in promotional materials significantly improves the efficiency and branding of MSMEs, enabling the production of high-quality content at a lower cost. However, challenges remain, related to the limited scope of the study which only focuses on one sector, namely Muslim fashion MSMEs and the lack of AI's ability to understand the nuances of brand identity in depth. This study contributes to increasing the understanding of the synergy between design thinking and generative AI, as it can provide practical guidance for MSMEs in optimizing digital marketing, and suggests future research that focuses more on assisting MSMEs directly in implementing AI in their businesses.},

  pages={1796-1799},
  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have rapidly risen to prominence in the sphere of deep learning. This is especially true when it comes to image generation, where GANs have displayed impressive capabilities. Over time, as researchers have grappled with the challenges posed by the original GAN model, a plethora of GAN variants have been introduced. These are tailored to counteract training instability, mode collapse, and various other challenges intrinsic to the base GAN model. Despite the extensive variety of GAN techniques available, there is still a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding their relative performances on specific datasets. For many practitioners, choosing the right GAN model for a given dataset remains a trial-and-error endeavor. In an attempt to shed light on this matter, our research undertakes a deep dive into three of the most notable GAN techniques: the classic GAN, the one built upon Wasserstein Distance, often abbreviated as W-GAN, and its subsequent evolution, WGAN-GP.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a novel framework for architecting enterprise AI, emphasizing the integration of three frameworks-TOGAF, BADIR, and INSIGHT-to create a robust and comprehensive methodology. This integrated approach addresses the unique challenges and considerations inherent in designing, implementing, and managing AI systems within an enterprise context. This approach leverages the strengths of three distinct frameworks, TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework), offers a structured approach to designing the data, application, and technology architecture necessary for AI implementation. Decisions Analysis, like BADIR (Business Question, Analysis Plan, Data, Insight, Recommendation), guides the translation of business objectives into data-driven decisions, ensuring AI initiatives are driven by clear business needs and result in actionable recommendations. Insights analysis is started by identifying key questions related to business processes and activities, guiding the design process with a focus on user feedback and iterative refinement, and promoting stakeholder engagement and data-driven decision-making. Simulated approach is provided in the paper as well as sample cases, integration considerations to legacy system, AI governance considerations and future directions.},

  abstract={In industrial production, Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers the opportunity to better understand AI models, not only to understand their decisions but also to be able to improve processes, which is possible even without the necessary experience. There are several widely used methods to implement this for Artificial Intelligence models, but no uniform standards and definitions. There are also still some hurdles on a technical and legal level as well as trust on the human side. Ultimately, the application of such techniques is particularly important in this area, but this is often not possible without the well-functioning and widespread use of Artificial Intelligence in manufacturing industry. However, it is a further step towards intelligent manufacturing and the acceptance of Artificial Intelligence in this area. The publication not only shows the latest developments, but also some use cases of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in manufacturing. Not only legal aspects but also ethical aspects are highlighted. In conclusion, it can be stated that Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods per se are well established, but their implementation and use in practice is lagging behind. A major point here in the future will be the explanation of generative artificial intelligence and user-centred explanations for non-domain experts. A standardised definition of explainability and standards for evaluating the individual methodologies must also be created.},

  year={2023},

  abstract={As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly popular, so too does the frequency it is attacked. One area where artificial intelligence models are being embraced heavily is avionics, where it is used in a variety of areas including intrusion detection, surveillance, radar, navigation, and more. These networks are vulnerable to a number of attacks, one of which being the adversarial attack. Adversarial attacks aim to perturb the input to the image classification model, which can lead to output misclassifications, lowering the overall model accuracy. This paper will demonstrate how such an attack can lower the accuracy of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on an aircraft image dataset. The perturbed inputs will be generated by a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on the same dataset as the CNN. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator. The generator will continually create new images based off of the dataset, while the discriminator decides whether or not the image is generated or from the reference dataset. This forms a feedback loop, where the generator continues to improve based on the output of the discriminator. Once trained, the outputs of the GAN will be used to misclassify the trained CNN in an attempt to lower the model’s accuracy. Following this, adversarial defenses such as feature squeezing and random smoothing will be discussed. These defenses attempt to mitigate the damage done by an attack, usually by adapting the model, modifying the input, or modifying the data the model is trained on. This can cause the accuracy of the model to slightly fall from its original accuracy, but with the benefit of being more resilient to adversarial attacks. We analyze this tradeoff and highlight the advantages of adversarial training in learning-enabled avionics systems.},

  abstract={Engineering systems globally face mounting demands for efficiency, sustainability, and resilience due to climate change, aging infrastructure, and limited resources. Locally, inefficiencies-such as reactive maintenance, inadequate design, and insufficient real-time monitoringdrive up costs and system failures. Traditional engineering methods, largely manual and rule-based, lack flexibility and predictive insight. Although artificial intelligence offers substantial promise, its integration is hindered by complexity, expense, and a scarcity of domain expertise, revealing a pressing research gap. To address this, a modular AI-based framework is proposed incorporating machine learning, generative design, predictive analytics, and sensor data. This framework aims to advance automation in design, enable predictive maintenance, optimize energy use, and enhance structural health monitoring. The anticipated result is greater efficiency, reduced downtime, and improved reliability, ultimately transforming conventional engineering into a smart, data-driven discipline suited to contemporary challenges.},

  year={2025},
  volume={13},
  number={},
  pages={62506-62526},
  abstract={This paper explores the application of Generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in urban energy management, assessing human users’ trust in AI systems that, while often accurate, can still make mistakes. It examines how different stakeholder groups—AI experts, energy domain experts, and non-experts—develop trust, distrust, or overtrust in AI-generated outputs and highlights the risks associated with these trust states. While overtrust can lead to blind reliance on incorrect AI outputs, distrust can result in the unnecessary rejection of accurate AI recommendations, ultimately reducing the effectiveness of AI-assisted decision-making. Using the VIRTSI (Variability and Impact of Reciprocal Trust States towards Intelligent Systems) methodology, this research monitors human-AI trust evolution through Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and quantifies trust behaviors using user-adapted Confusion Matrices, addressing a critical gap in AI trust dynamics that traditional acceptance models overlook. The findings validate VIRTSI’s ability to track trust transitions. The study reveals that AI experts exhibit skepticism due to their awareness of AI’s limitations, energy experts tend to overtrust AI, likely influenced by its confident and seemingly reliable responses, and non-experts display inconsistent trust, highlighting decision-making challenges. These findings confirm VIRTSI’s premise that trust in AI is dynamic, varies by user expertise, and must be continuously monitored and assessed. Ultimately, this study strengthens VIRTSI as a necessary framework for assessing and optimizing trust in AI-driven sustainability solutions, ensuring that AI systems are not only trusted but also used effectively and responsibly in energy applications. Unlike other models of technology acceptance that focus solely on adoption, VIRTSI provides a continuous and quantifiable approach to trust calibration, identifying harmful trust patterns and guiding improvements in AI-human interaction over time.},

  year={2024},
  volume={17},
  number={},
  pages={1327-1340},
  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is widely recognized as one of the most influential technologies for the future, having sparked a paradigm shift in scientific research. The field of education has also been greatly impacted by this transformative technology, with researchers exploring the applications of generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, in education. However, existing research primarily focuses on generating text from text, and there remains a relative scarcity of studies on leveraging multimodal generation capabilities to address key challenges in multimodal data supported instruction. In this article, we present a technical framework for generating Tang poetry situational videos, emphasizing the utilization of generative AI to address the need for multimedia teaching resources. Our framework comprises three main modules: textual situational comprehension, image creation, and video generation. Moreover, we have developed a situational video generation system that incorporates various technologies, including text-to-text generation models, text-to-image generation models, image interpolation, text-to-speech synthesis, and video synthesis. To ascertain the efficacy of the modules within the Tang poetry situational video generation system, we undertook a comparative analysis utilizing the prevalent text-to-image and text-to-video generation models. The empirical findings indicate that our approach is capable of generating images that exhibit greater semantic similarity with the poems, thereby enabling a better comprehension of the poem's connotations and its key components.

  abstract={Significant progress has been achieved in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) in recent years. Nevertheless, a significant gap continues to exist in the effective surveillance of human actions, activities, and the recognition of human movements or poses. Machines and computers are fundamentally incapable of comprehending human activities without user intervention. Consequently, we now depend on technology to record and archive human actions through live broadcast data, videos, or images. The field of pose estimation, which is a critical area of research with applications in fields such as Augmented Reality, Animation, Gaming, Healthcare, and Sports, is expanding due to the rapid advancement of computer vision technology. This project implements innovative methods to train models and deter- mine poses, utilizing random inputs from internet images, videos, and live streaming. In particular, models that have been trained with artificial intelligence have been created for daily physical activities that necessitate intricate pose estimation. The initial step in the project is to utilize MediaPipe to estimate the poses of the human body. Subsequently, the angles between the body joints are calculated to create the desired models. Additionally, a web-based user interface (WEB-UI) was developed to enable access from any location. The methodology involves the extraction of data from critical body locations, the framing of models, and the utilization of the MediaPipe model due to its superior performance and features in comparison to other models. The objective of this method is to develop a web application for end-users, train AI models for daily physical activities, and establish an efficient system for single human pose estimation. This approach provides a cost-effective alternative to physical trainers and enables the monitoring of health and sports activities to be enhanced.},

  abstract={This study uses Generative Artificial Intelligence (gAI) to advance industrial digitization. Although the use of gAI looks promising for industrial digitization, there are significant gaps in current Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, which limit their applicability to such applications. By developing a theoretical framework, the aim is to provide explanations for gAI to improve decision-making processes with actionable insights and explanations for their intended outcomes. The proposed work has an impact on facilitating inspection, monitoring, optimization, and maintenance of industrial equipment and machinery. The theoretical framework proposed in this paper will address this challenge by following a three-step approach: 1) learning prior and posterior from data, 2) feature attribution and counterfactual explanation-based methods, and 3) integrated XAI. While the current study is theoretical, future work will focus on applying the approach to real-world industrial scenarios.},

  abstract={The introduction of synthetic intellect in the processes and procedures also termed artificial intelligence (AI) has risen as a disruptive catalyst across many different sectors. AI has found widespread application in automated systems, financing, and healthcare. With the increasing use of AI, models and algorithms have started surpassing the significant ideals of human performance. The significance of generative AI (GenAI) lies in its concentration on the realms of knowledge work and creative labor, which encompasses a significant number of humans, totalling billions. Procreative AI or GenAI has the potential of enhancing the efficiency and creativity of people by at least 10%. It can also improve their speed, efficiency, and overall capabilities to some extent. GenAI possesses the capability of generating immense economic value up to trillions of dollars. AI systems used to be rule-based and had limited capabilities. The emergence of algorithms for deep learning toward the century’s end paved the way for more sophisticated GenAI models. GenAI is a specialized branch of AI that specifically concentrates on the production of novel content, including audio, video, and writings, through the utilization of artificially intelligent deep learning algorithms. Implementing AI for decision- making in sustainable project life cycle operations remains difficult. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has empowered developers to engage with generative algorithms, effectively transforming natural language queries into code for diverse programming languages. Highly advanced technologies such as Codacy and OpenAI Codex are widely utilized to assist LLMs and their adoption is steadily growing. GenAI solutions leverage aspects such as “completion” to significantly improve the creation of software. AI is extensively used in a number of manufacturing organizations, including those in healthcare, finance, robotics, and automation. However, using AI to make decisions in sustainable project life cycle management is still a difficult undertaking. The present research explores the utilization of AI techniques for decision-making to promote sustainable operations throughout the various phases of a project life cycle. This chapter compares the existing GenAI project life cycles and also suggests the practical framework, as also provides the various futuristic recommendations for sustainable project life cycles.},
