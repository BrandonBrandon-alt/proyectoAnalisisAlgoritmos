  abstract={This work in progress, innovative practice paper proposes a Learning and Teaching Impact Assessment Tool (TALIAT) that would help in assessing the sways of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) on important aspects of Learning and Teaching (L&T). The focus of TALIAT is to identify the most relevant elements of GAI grammar and establish how they would reflect on Learning and Teaching practices. GAIsupported systems are generally perceived beneficial as they ensure resource availability, quick and ongoing feedback, higher level of interactivity, and continued engagement. GAI tools also inculcate the ability to perform independent research through progressive and systematic probing and consequent delivery of information. Nonetheless, issues pertaining to trust, liability, transparency, honesty, fairness in judgement and trustworthy reporting of student success need to be addressed for proper adoption of GAI applications. It is being acknowledged now that various stakeholders like system developers, administrators, policymakers, psychologists, educators, sociologists, and legal experts need to work together and agree upon standards and frameworks for producing professionally, ethically, and legally acceptable GAI systems. For these stakeholders to work together, an easy to follow and adopt assessment tool needs to be designed. This would facilitate establishing methods, and processes for confidently determining impacts of GAI technologies on Learning and Teaching. The current literature has yet to provide such facilitation. Such enablement would: improve teacher's perception of, and users' confidence in, GAI systems as tools like TALIAT would assist in assessing impacts of GAI tools prior to their deployment. The proposed TALIAT could also safeguard quality of information, student competence reporting, academic culture, and social and ethical values. TALIAT projects sixteen elements of grammar on seven important aspects of GAI implications namely, handling biases, prompt tuning and evaluation, output fairness, regulatory compliance, error detection, accountability and explainability. These seven aspects are deemed important for investigating the purpose, impetuses, scope, and L&T impact mitigation strategies of GAI applications. A set of thirty-two questions is included in TALIAT for GAI tools' impact assessment. TALIAT will be useful for the GAI stakeholders to work together as it enables informed decision making about adopting GAI systems and places rail guards for development of trustworthy GAI systems.},

  abstract={Semantic communication (SC) leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to extract task-relevant semantic information based on specific requirements, enabling more efficient communication, which is regarded as one of the critical components for future 6G intelligent networks. Meanwhile, generative AI (GAI), a significant technological breakthrough in recent years, is renowned for its semantic extraction capabilities and data generation creativity. Inspired by this, in this paper, we explore the integration of GAI into SC, focusing on technological intersection and security risks. We begin with a comprehensive overview of SC and GAI, analyzing the current challenges. Subsequently, we elaborate on how GAI can optimize SC from multiple perspectives, including semantic extraction, data transmission, and cloud-edge deployment. In particular, we focus on security and privacy issues within the GAI-enhanced SC architecture. Finally, we validate the feasibility of our theory through a case study and outline potential directions for future research.},

  abstract={With the growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into higher education, learners’ trust in AI systems has attracted increasing attention. This meta-analysis synthesized 78 independent effect sizes from 42 empirical studies (N = 28 970) to examine key antecedents and consequences of AI trust. Four categories of antecedents were assessed: technological performance, user experience, ethics and safety, and sociodemographic and individual differences. Trust in AI was also analyzed in relation to behavioral intention, learning outcomes, and AI acceptance. Results showed that technological performance was the strongest predictor of trust, followed by user experience and individual differences, while ethics and safety had a relatively weaker impact. Trust in AI significantly predicted all three outcomes, underscoring its mediating role. Moderator analyses revealed that high-level feedback enhanced the effects of technological performance and ethics on trust, and that trust was generally higher in learning-support tasks than in academic writing tasks. These findings offer theoretical and practical insights for optimizing educational AI design and promoting adaptive, trustworthy systems.},

  abstract={The introduction and rapid adoption of particular Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as Large Language Models, where among other, Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a prominent one, have caused a significant increase in research interest for prompt engineering. Prompt engineering can be loosely described as a new emerging field where one attempts to develop particular methods, strategies, and frameworks with the main aim of organizing and structuring inputs in such a way that sophisticated AI systems can perform different tasks. These methods, techniques, and frameworks can be concepts like in-context learning, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Retrieval Augmented Generation, ReAct prompting, and Directional Stimulus Prompting. These approaches are mainly developed so users can communicate more effectively and accurately with AI language models and enable obtaining better outputs or responses tailored to queries or goals they set. As an extension and new contribution to the mentioned research field, this conceptual paper aims to introduce, propose, and theorize the notion of ‘educational promptization’. This will be done by connecting prompting to a particular social scientific practice perspective, sociomateriality. The rationale for arguing, however, is related to a need to develop an alternative research perspective to those that already dominate the mentioned research field, a research stream this conceptual paper also aims to engage with. Educational promptization is suggested as there is a demand to develop a more student-centric media literacy, especially as students and teachers engage with AI language interpreters on a daily basis. This means that the proposed educational promptization can arguably be considered to be part of a future AI literacy. An essential component of it is that one has to encompass the relational and symmetrical engagement with AI models. This is perhaps required because students will most likely be challenged to master the knowledge and skills in designing prompts, while simultaneously being capable of critically and meaningfully assessing the output of the prompts they created. In other words, mastering the complex input-and-output engagements with an AI system will be essential in students’ future learning processes.},

  abstract={With the advent of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the proliferation of deepfakes and the spread of m/disinformation have emerged as formidable threats to the integrity of information ecosystems worldwide. This paper provides an overview of the current literature. Within the frontier AI’s crucial application in developing defense mechanisms for detecting deepfakes, we highlight the mechanisms through which generative AI based on large models (LM-based GenAI) craft seemingly convincing yet fabricated contents. We explore the multifaceted implications of LM-based GenAI on society, politics, and individual privacy violations, underscoring the urgent need for robust defense strategies. To address these challenges, in this study, we introduce an integrated framework that combines advanced detection algorithms, cross-platform collaboration, and policy-driven initiatives to mitigate the risks associated with AI-Generated Content (AIGC). By leveraging multi-modal analysis, digital watermarking, and machine learning-based authentication techniques, we propose a defense mechanism adaptable to AI capabilities of ever-evolving nature. Furthermore, the paper advocates for a global consensus on the ethical usage of GenAI and implementing cyber-wellness educational programs to enhance public awareness and resilience against m/disinformation. Our findings suggest that a proactive and collaborative approach involving technological innovation and regulatory oversight is essential for safeguarding netizens while interacting with cyberspace against the insidious effects of deepfakes and GenAI-enabled m/disinformation campaigns.},

  year={2023},
  volume={27},

  pages={5634-5643},
  abstract={Although the concept of digital twin technology has been in existence for nearly half a century, its application in healthcare is a relatively recent development. In healthcare, the utilization of digital twin and data-driven models has proven to enhance clinical decision support, particularly in the treatment and assessment of chronic wounds, leading to improved clinical outcomes. This article proposes the implementation of a digital twin in the domain of healthcare, specifically in the management of chronic wounds, by leveraging artificial intelligence techniques. The digital twin is composed of data collection, data processing, and AI models dedicated to wound healing. A novel AI pipeline is utilized to track the healing of chronic wounds. The digital twin, serving as a virtual representation of the actual wound, simulates and replicates the healing process. Furthermore, the proposed wound-healing prediction model effectively guides the treatment of chronic wounds. Additionally, by comparing the actual wound with its digital twin, the system enables early identification of non-healing wounds, facilitating timely adjustments and modifications to the treatment plan. By incorporating a digital twin in healthcare, the proposed system enables personalized and tailored treatments, potentially playing a crucial role in proactive problem identification.},

  year={2025},
  volume={12},
  number={12},
  pages={20757-20772},
  abstract={As a cutting-edge technology of low-altitude Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), autonomous aerial vehicle object detection significantly enhances the surveillance services capabilities of low-altitude AIoT. However, the difficulty of object detection is exacerbated by the high proportion of small and obscure objects in the captured images. To address the mentioned challenges, we present an efficient multiband infrared small object detection approach for low-altitude intelligent surveillance services. First, we propose the multiband infrared image fusion algorithm based on cascade-GAN (MIF-CGAN), which produces fused images with high information entropy and high contrast. Then, the Transformer-based multiscale dense small object detection (MsDSOD) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm consists of the global-local object detection (G-LOD) network, the object dense area extraction (O-DAE) module, and the weighted boxes fusion (WBF) module. It extracts small objects features at different scales from infrared images and fuses the global and local detection results to accurately identify small objects in dense scenes. Furthermore, compared to the traditional algorithms, the mean average precision (mAP) of MsDSOD is improved by 0.80% and the average precision in small object detection  $({\mathrm { AP}}_{s})$  is improved by 0.72%. The proposed algorithm is optimally suited to deal with complex scenes with dense small objects and background occlusion.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={In this research-to-practice full work, we will explore how innovative educational strategies can improve students' learning experiences. Specifically, we will focus on the early development of skills in engineering students, such as numerical manipulation for problem-solving, proficient spreadsheet management, experimental implementation, and mastery of mathematical modeling complemented by informed decision-making with graphics understanding and interpretation. The effective utilization of available technological resources helps to enhance the student learning experience and prepare them for the challenges in their engineering professional practice. Physics courses often present high rates of low academic performance, but these innovative approaches can enhance active student engagement and help nurture essential skills. However, integrating technology into innovative teaching methods can have implications; one seen recently is the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (G-AI) in many instruction courses; as a technology of easy access and manipulation, it can result in a confused tool if students don't have the appropriate instruction in its use. Therefore, educating students on the ethical and proper use of AI technology is crucial, guiding them in formulating relevant questions and accurately interpreting the results. To achieve this, we used the Learning Science and Engineering with Electronic Spreadsheets Cycle (LSEESC) methodology, which has been rigorously tested across various contexts over the last four years and has shown promising results. We will support its implementation with comprehensive guidance and use Artificial Intelligence as a prompt/chat tool (e.g., Chat GPT) as a supplementary tool. This strategy aimed to help students develop effective study habits for independent study sessions and promote autonomous learning. We examine how students ask for help from AI, including their choice of words and language. We will also investigate the effects of using casual or informal language and suggest guidelines for constructing practical questions. Our goal was to assist students in obtaining a better understanding and explanations of physics concepts and problem-solving exercises with the help of AI combined with a well-defined methodology, like the LSEESC, which promotes the development of skills like numerical manipulation, mathematical modeling, variables understanding, graphics generation, interpretation, and understanding. The learning intervention considers N = 140 students for working on the LSEESC methodology and using G-AI in physics courses during spring 2024, with students in the first year of academic engineering programs. The topics to evidence the learning process are kinematics and electrics. The results were analyzed with the Normalized Conceptual Gain (NCG) given a value of <g> = 0.75 and 0.67, the Concentration Factor (CF), Rasch's index, and qualitative students' question formulation. This is particularly important because, in some instances, the results provided by G-AI were incorrect owing to the system's inability to detect specific implications that a human can easily recognize; the teacher explained the confused results presented by G-AI and student received the corresponding feedback about these issues with artificial intelligence.},

  abstract={This innovative practice full paper describes how to integrate generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis (CS2) homework at Oklahoma State University. Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis (CS2) course covers extremely important knowledge and skills of becoming a computer scientist. However, students might fail to meet the learning outcomes of CS2 course, somewhat due to the abstract nature of concepts but also because of a misunderstanding of concepts, the selection of inappropriate data structure and algorithm, a lack of effective debugging skills, and writing inefficient code. Currently we are in an Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, and generative AI (also widely known as AI chatbots) are already popular across college and university campuses. Generative AI that are designed to learn and mimic human conversation is capable of generating, translating, or paraphrasing text and answering questions in a way that is often indistinguishable from human-generated content. We investigate the above-mentioned potential challenges faced by students while learning CS2 course at Oklahoma State University (OSU) and redesign the course homework in Fall 2023 semester. The objectives of the redesigned course homework are to provide students with opportunities to use generative AI to support their learning in the CS2 course as well as measure the effectiveness of utilizing generative AI to improve student learning outcomes in the CS2 course. At the end of Fall 2023 semester, we conducted a student perception survey in the CS2 course and collected valuable feedback from 47 out of 61 students (77% response rate). In summary, 85.1%, 76.6%, 74.5%, 63.8%, and 70.2% respondents indicated that generative AI help to understand testing and debugging better, improve coding skills and code quality, design and implement efficient data structures and algorithms, select appropriate algorithms and data structures with the assistance of generative AI, and under-stand the importance of designing and implementing efficient data structures and algorithms, respectively. In this paper, we summarize the experience of redesigning CS2 course homework at OSU, share lessons learned, and provide candid suggestions for utilizing course homework in CS2 courses at other institutions.},

  abstract={Using Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Business Development and Opportunities is a ground-breaking concept that is changing how businesses formulate their strategies and content, how they can improve existing decisions and/or foster new market initiatives. Marketing can be enhanced by the use of advanced model AI in generating more profound approaches that can be adopted in creating marketing material in order to take up a business a notch higher. Thus, this paper aims at proposing a new method that complements the use of GPT-4 and Variational Autoencoders (VAE) in generating good business content and synthetic data as compared to conventional approaches. The applied in this paper is a python-based methodology that comprises of data collection process which involves Kaggle datasets encompassing market trends, customer behavior, and competitors analysis. Specifically, web scraping and data augmentation are used in preprocessing with the help of BeautifulSoup, Scrapy as well as SMOTE to improve the quality and variability of the dataset. Feature engineering employs PCA and TF-IDF to select and transform the features for improving the decision boundary of the dataset and to obtain the textual patterns. The GPT-4 model is used for the generation of contextualised and business relevant text, which helps the VAEs in the creation of synthetic data that improves the models capability in data sparse situations and for various business scenarios. The procedure of fine-tuning of the parameters of the model to enhance accuracy and relevance of the AI generated outputs is known as Bayesian Optimization. The suggested approach performs better than the existing literature including better BLEU scores, cross-validation accuracy, and runs faster. Essentially, this research offers a strong basis for employing generative AI in business while presenting notable improvements over prior models and improving business strategy implementation.},

However, the styles of anime character portrait are quite different and Generative Adversarial Networks is also prone to cause problems including mode collapse, which makes it hard to generate good anime character portrait samples. In this paper, DRAGAN model will be optimized and the improved version of the basic structure of Conv-BN-Relu-Pooling will be applied reasonably. The optimized DRAGAN is trained by using alternating gradient updates procedure to achieve high-quality generation samples. At the same time, through the experimental comparison with other generative adversarial networks of deep learning, it is finally verified that the optimized DRAGAN performs better than the experimental comparison group in terms of image visual quality, FID and gradient penalty terms. The mode collapse problem has also been alleviated finally.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the effect of midterm and short quizzes on the success scores at the end of the course through machine learning methods. Data from 3,427 students in the Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences of Istanbul Rumeli University, recorded from the year 2019 to 2024, were analyzed, and of that, 1,547 records were qualified for machine learning after applying specific filtering criteria. Due to insufficient data, 6,300 synthetic records were generated using the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) method. To ensure high-quality data generation and stable training, a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) was implemented, enhancing the synthetic dataset's diversity and reliability. In this paper, the algorithms of Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost, Linear Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used for the classification and prediction of course success. Among these, the most accurate performance, quantified for example by R2 score, Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error, was given by RF, with a probability of being correct at 83.81%. The results indicate that midterm exams have a significantly stronger influence on predicting course success, while short quizzes play an important role in maintaining consistent student engagement and reinforcing foundational concepts. Future studies will aim for data diverseness by adding more features and comparing new methods, such as Artificial Neural Networks with hyperparameter optimization.},

In this article, we identify the key requirements and challenges of edge-native AI in 6G. A self-learning architecture based on self-supervised generative adversarial nets is introduced to demonstrate the potential performance improvement that can be achieved by automatic data learning and synthesizing at the edge of the network. We evaluate the performance of our proposed self-learning architecture in a university campus shuttle system connected via a 5G network. Our result shows that the proposed architecture has the potential to identify and classify unknown services that emerge in edge computing networks. Future trends and key research problems for self-learning-enabled 6G edge intelligence are also discussed.},

  abstract={In this work, we build a QuizGPT web interface for learners to learn Python via quizzing and chatting. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of generative AI on learning. To effectively evaluate learners’ learning achievements, the quizzes must be diverse, and the options should be challenging to ensure a complete understanding of the material. It is a time-consuming challenge for teachers to create adaptive quizzes based on learners’ levels for individual learning needs. This study generates 366 quiz questions automatically via generative AI in three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), based on Python knowledge points. A positive correlation observed between the QuizGPT platform activities and learners’ test scores. These activities include the number of quizzes attended, the correctness rates, and the frequency of participation in generative AI sessions. Additionally, QuizGPT platform activities could predict learners’ test scores with a Root Mean Squared Error percentage (%RMSE) of 3.58%. Remarkably, interaction with generative AI proves to enhance Python programming skills more effectively than the number of quiz attempts. Survey analysis reveals that QuizGPT can reduce learning anxiety and enhance learning interest. Our findings suggest that generative AI, as implemented in the QuizGPT platform, is a potent tool for academic improvement, significantly enhancing self-regulation and engagement in learning Python programming.},

  abstract={In the past two years, technology has undergone significant changes that have had a major impact on healthcare systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a key component of this change, and it can assist doctors with various healthcare systems and intelligent health systems. AI is crucial in diagnosing common diseases, developing new medications, and analyzing patient information from electronic health records. However, one of the main issues with adopting AI in healthcare is the lack of transparency, as doctors must interpret the output of the AI. Explainable AI (XAI) is extremely important for the healthcare sector and comes into play in this regard. With XAI, doctors, patients, and other stakeholders can more easily examine a decision's reliability by knowing its reasoning due to XAI's interpretable explanations. Deep learning is used in this study to discuss explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in medical image analysis. The primary goal of this paper is to provide a generic six-category XAI architecture for classifying DL-based medical image analysis and interpretability methods.The interpretability method/XAI approach for medical image analysis is often categorized based on the explanation and technical method. In XAI approaches, the explanation method is further sub-categorized into three types: text-based, visual-based, and examples-based. In interpretability technical method, it was divided into nine categories. Finally, the paper discusses the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of each neural network-based interpretability method for medical imaging analysis.},

  abstract={Pathology is the most important branch of Medical Science which fundamentally concerns the origin, cause, and nature of the disease. This domain contributes the most important part of the diagnostic infrastructure. The pathological examination includes examining, Tissues, Organs, Body fluids. In this examination, the tissue is fixed on a glass slide by certain procedures and then observed under a microscope for disease. Now with technological advancement, the traditional pathological operation is getting evolved and emerged as Digital pathology. Digital pathology comprises the digitalization of Histopathological slides using a Whole-slide scanner which is a microscope under robotic and computer control and analysing these digitalized images or whole-slide image using a Computational approach. This digitalization creates a high-resolution, enhanced pixel image of pathological specimen that ultimately generates a tremendous amount of data up to gigabytes per biopsy. Because of algorithmic advancement and more convenient computing power, in the past few decades, Artificial Intelligence and machine learning have spread their roots into healthcare and clinical applications. And artificial intelligence and digital pathology synergy is one of the examples of these two fields intersection. This synergy will have majestic results in Diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive analysis of Whole-slide images.},

  abstract={The rise in usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT emphasizes the significance of exploring how prompt inputs influence response quality. This research analyzed 308 prompt-response pairs sourced from students taking Project-based classes like AI, machine learning, and Game design. Prompt quality was assessed based on specificity, clarity, and tone, while response quality was measured based on accuracy, relevance and complexity using a 5-point Likert scale. Our study explored correlation between various factors such as prompt specificity, response accuracy and relevance using Pearson analysis. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of ChatGPT across each prompt type to determine which prompt class generated the best and worst results. Through the adoption of a prompt engineering approach, the paper identifies practical recommendations that students can employ to improve their interactions with ChatGPT. The research emphasizes that advanced methods such as prompt chaining and knowledge-augmented prompts are more effective than simple prompts in generating precise and comprehensive outputs successfully. This study shows ChatGPT's performance across various domains. The outcome of this study aims to help educators and learners to understand how to use generative AI effectively for programming problems and to support the development of efficient AI -enhanced learning environments.},

  abstract={The authors clarified in 2020 that the relationship between AI and security can be classified into four categories: (a) attacks using AI, (b) attacks by AI itself, (c) attacks to AI, and (d) security measures using AI, and summarized research trends for each. Subsequently, ChatGPT became available in November 2022, and the various potential applications of ChatGPT and other generative AIs and the associated risks have attracted attention. In this study, we examined how the emergence of generative AI affects the relationship between AI and security. The results show that (a) the need for the four perspectives of AI and security remains unchanged in the era of generative AI, (b) The generalization of AI targets and automatic program generation with the birth of generative AI will greatly increase the risk of attacks by the AI itself, (c) The birth of generative AI will make it possible to generate easy-to-understand answers to various questions in natural language, which may lead to the spread of fake news and phishing e-mails that can easily fool many people and an increase in AI-based attacks. In addition, it became clear that (1) attacks using AI and (2) responses to attacks by AI itself are highly important. Among these, the analysis of attacks by AI itself, using an attack tree, revealed that the following measures are needed: (a) establishment of penalties for developing inappropriate programs, (b) introduction of a reporting system for signs of attacks by AI, (c) measures to prevent AI revolt by incorporating Asimov's three principles of robotics, and (d) establishment of a mechanism to prevent AI from attacking humans even when it becomes confused.},

This paper explores the potential of generative AI in enhancing teaching methodologies and learning experiences, addressing challenges, and proposing solutions for its effective integration into education systems. The generative AI tool, ChatGPT, has captivated global attention with its remarkable ability to perform sophisticated and complex tasks. Its advanced capabilities, particularly within the field of education, have elicited mixed reactions among educators, as this breakthrough in AI technology is poised to revolutionize traditional educational practices. This exploratory study synthesizes recent literature to examine the potential benefits and challenges of ChatGPT in enhancing teaching and learning. On the positive side, ChatGPT offers opportunities to foster personalized and interactive learning experiences, support the creation of prompts for formative assessments, and provide ongoing feedback to inform teaching and learning processes. However, the study also identifies significant limitations inherent to ChatGPT, such as the generation of inaccurate information, potential biases stemming from its training data, and privacy concerns that may exacerbate existing inequities. To ensure the constructive and safe integration of ChatGPT into education, the study presents recommendations for its effective use. These include encouraging collaboration among policymakers, researchers, educators, and technology experts to address the risks and ethical implications of generative AI. By initiating proactive discussions and developing comprehensive guidelines, stakeholders can harness the potential of ChatGPT to enhance education while safeguarding the interests of learners and educators alike.},

  pages={297-301},
  abstract={The telemetry data of spacecraft is an ultra-high dimensional time series used to indicate on-orbit operation status, and anomaly detection can effectively ensure safety and reliability. Aiming at the characteristics and complex correlation of high dimensional telemetry data, this paper proposes a novel anomaly detection method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for telemetry data anomaly detection. Instead of treating each variable independently, our proposed method captures the latent representation amongst multi-dimensional time series. For normal data, the GAN-based anomaly detection method can obtain a reconstructed time series similar to the original time series, learning the probability distribution model of normal data. For abnormal data, the reconstructed time series deviates greatly from the original time series. In the GAN framework, we use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as the network structure of generator for time series reconstruction and discriminator for calculating the probability of being the real time series, which can learn the temporal features of telemetry data. We also propose a novel anomaly score called GDScore, which comprehensively considers the reconstruction error of the generator and the output of the discriminator. We conduct experiments with two telemetry datasets, which verifies that our proposed GAN-based anomaly detection method can effectively detect outliers.},

  abstract={In the era of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC), conditional multimodal synthesis technologies (e.g., text-to-image) are dynamically reshaping the natural content. Brain signals, serving as potential reflections of how the brain interprets external information, exhibit a distinctive one-to-many correspondence with various external modalities. This correspondence makes brain signals emerge as a promising guiding condition for multimodal synthesis (e.g., image, text, and audio), which is crucial for developing practical brain–computer interface systems and unraveling complex mechanisms underlying human perception. This survey comprehensively examines the emerging field of brain-conditional multimodal synthesis, termed AIGC-brain, to delineate the current landscape and future directions. To begin, related neuroimaging datasets and generative models are introduced as the foundation of AIGC-brain decoding and analysis. Next, we present a comprehensive taxonomy according to AIGC-brain methodologies, followed by task-specific representative work and implementation details to facilitate in-depth comparison and analysis. Quality assessments are then introduced for both qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Finally, this survey explores insights gained, outlining current challenges and prospects of AIGC-brain. As a pioneering survey, this article paves the way for future advances in AIGC-brain research.},

  abstract={In order to estimate the model using the method it is necessary to train two different models simultaneously. The first model, called the model (D) is responsible, for determining whether a particular sample is from the training data or generated by another model called G. On the hand G aims to understand the underlying distribution of the data. By training G to maximize the likelihood of D making mistakes a competitive environment is established. There are applications for G and D but one particularly notable solution emerges. D consistently evaluates any input as if it came from training data while G effectively captures the details of that training data distribution. Notably this system can be trained using known techniques like backpropagation when implementing G and D as multilayer perceptrons. This eliminates the need for inference networks or intricate Markov chains, during both training and sample generation processes. Thorough evaluations of the generated samples confirm the potential of this framework as demonstrated through testing. This innovative approach offers an efficient means to capture data distributions, which could potentially revolutionize generative modeling.},

  abstract={Conventional autoencoder-based systems, comprising a neural-network encoder at the transmitter and a neural-network decoder at the receiver, often face limitations in re-alistic signal transmission due to its reliance on differentiable channel models. In response to this limitation, an end-to-end framework has emerged, employing a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for channel learning. The CGAN not only learns to represent channel effects through feature extraction but also facilitates gradient back-propagation between the receiver and the transmitter, thereby enhancing the system's adaptability. This paper extends the CGAN-based end-to-end system from single input single output channels to multiple input multiple output (MIMO) scenarios. This CGAN-based MIMO system demonstrates promising performance comparable to the autoencoder communication systems, highlighting the potential of CGANs as effective alternatives for original channels.},

  abstract={Due to the randomness and time correlation of photovoltaic (PV) power output, the PV data obtained by conventional short-term point or interval prediction methods cannot support the robust scheduling and reliable operation of the power system under the condition of high proportion of PV integration. A photovoltaic random scenario prediction model based on Time - generative adversarial network (TimeGAN) is proposed. Firstly, the photovoltaic samples are decomposed into static and time-series data, and the network structures of embedding, reconstruction, generation and discrimination are constructed. Secondly, taking the static and time-series data as samples, the embedding and reconstruction networks are jointly trained. Finally, taking the output of the embedding network as samples, the generation and discrimination networks are trained adversarially, and the output of the generation network is fed back to the embedding-reconstruction training to test the fitting effect of the time series. Aiming to minimize the reconstruction, supervised and unsupervised losses, the model conducts in-depth learning of the photovoltaic time characteristics and predicts random scenarios. The validity of the proposed model is verified by the example calculation.},

  abstract={Face image super-resolution reconstruction is a crucial task for enhancing low-quality surveillance videos. Most state-of-the-art approaches employ generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs are known to suffer from training instability issues. We propose a single face image super-resolution method called Single Face Image Super-Resolution Reconstruction (SFSR), based on Wasserstein GANs and residual dense networks. Without requiring any prior information, our model can directly generate high-resolution face images at 4x or 8x scale from arbitrary low-resolution inputs, outperforming traditional bilinear upsampling. To further enhance image quality, we utilize a multi-level residual dense generator with skip connections. Our loss function combines pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial losses to simultaneously optimize fidelity and realism. Extensive experiments on CelebA and CNBC datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance, validating the efficacy of our approach for stabilizing GAN training and producing sharp, artifact-free super-resolved face images.},

  abstract={Underwater image enhancement is a crucial technology for supporting underwater exploration and rescue operations. With the continuous development of the ocean, underwater activities such as archaeology, pipeline inspection, and dredging have been increasing. Nevertheless, owing to the unique complexity of the underwater environment, captured underwater images often face the challenge of information loss, manifested as blurry images, low signal - to - noise ratios, and poor color quality. These issues significantly limit the effective utilization and value of high - quality underwater images in scientific research and engineering practices. Currently, common problems in the field of underwater image enhancement research include high algorithm complexity and insufficient feature extraction capabilities. Therefore, to address the problems of insufficient feature extraction of the target information under test, we adopted the generative adversarial network (GAN) as the main architecture and incorporated an attention mechanism into the network generator. This enables us to centre around the key information of the image during feature extraction, resulting in clearer images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing underwater image enhancement methods, validating the effectiveness and the proposed approach.},

  abstract={In haze weather, visible light is scattered and absorbed when it passes through the atmosphere, causing significant degradation in image quality. To address this issue, we propose a multi-scale fusion dehazing algorithm based on an improved Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). In the generator part, we design a multi-scale fusion attention network (Grid-G) with a three rows, multi-column structure. The network first extracts and strengthens local and global features in the image through a feature enhancement module, effectively solving the problem that traditional dehazing methods cannot fully capture image details and global semantic information. Then, channel attention and coordinate attention are introduced to process the dense fog area and high-frequency area of the image from different angles. Finally, a multi-scale fusion module is designed to replace the original ordinary feature splicing operation and enhance the detail fidelity of the image.In the discriminator part, a fusion discriminator (FDG-D) is constructed to enhance the ability to distinguish the source of the image by introducing the high-frequency and low-frequency information of the image as additional priors. The experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper not only has natural colors and clear details subjectively, but also outperforms the existing mainstream algorithms in objective indicators.},

  abstract={English has become the most widely used language in the world. In the fields of English education and cultural dissemination, traditional teaching methods and materials are no longer able to meet the growing demand for cultural understanding and communication. This study constructed a Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) model, which generates highly realistic and diverse cultural communication materials by training generators and discriminators. The generator generates data from random noise, while the discriminator distinguishes between generated data and real data. The experimental results show that the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) value of the material generated by GANs is much lower than that of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), exhibiting higher image realism; its Mode Coverage (MC) value is also higher than other methods, averaging 90.428%. In addition, the audience showed high click through rates and engagement with the materials generated by GANs, verifying their effectiveness in cultural communication and confirming the potential of GANs in generating diverse English cultural communication materials.},

  abstract={This paper explores the applicability of conditional generative adversarial networks in audio-to-audio translation problems and proposes a neural network architecture capable of doing so. Recent advances have shown that causal convolutions can be effective for modeling raw audio when their kernel is dilated by many factors, in contrast to previous techniques that utilized recurrent approaches. Embedding such convolutions within a conditional GAN architecture allows the targeted generation of raw audio given a certain input. This architecture can then be used to learn and simulate certain translative operations applied to an input signal. This creates the defined problem of converting one audio signal into another, which has different characteristics. We also propose a novel discriminator structure for the evaluation of generated audio.},

  abstract={The research led by AI specialist, Andre Cia, stated that ChatGPT would immediately extinguish the profession of copywriter, translator, and proofreader and, within 12 months, the profession of journalist. The eventual extinction of such professions, through the transfer of imminently human tasks to a Generative AI technology, will increase structural unemployment in Brazil, due to the need for these unemployed workers to seek greater qualifications so that they can obtain their reinsertion into the job market. The purpose of this article is to analyze and determine whether the exterminating predictions mentioned were materialized, including the worsening of Brazilian structural unemployment, with repercussions on public spending for the payment of unemployment insurance. Using the quantitative research method to approach numerical data and public statistics on the subject, as well as descriptive qualitative for the purpose of understanding the phenomenon under study and the technique of reviewing accessible literature, supporting literature and reviewing the legislation, it was found that the use of ChatGPT did not exterminate the professions studied and was not even responsible for the high Brazilian unemployment rate or high public spending.},

Secondly, autoencoder-based techniques focus on learning optimal embeddings for questions and images, achieving comparable results with GAN due to better ability on complex questions. Lastly, attention mechanisms, incorporating Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB), address language priors and attention modeling, albeit with a complexity-performance trade-off.

  abstract={The aviation business encounters difficulties in correctly and swiftly predicting flight fares due to the dynamic nature of the sector. Factors such as variations in demand, fuel costs, and the intricacies of various routes have an impact on this. This work presents a new method to tackle this issue by utilizing generative artificial intelligence (GAI) approaches to accurately forecast airfares in real-time. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates generative models, deep learning architectures, and historical pricing data to improve the precision of future flight price predictions. The study employs a GAI within a cutting-edge web engineering framework. This approach is designed primarily to gather knowledge about complex patterns and relationships present in historical airline data. Through the utilization of this methodology, the model is able to accurately perceive complex connections and adjust to ever-changing market conditions. Our model utilizes deep neural networks to effectively handle various circumstances and extract vital information, so facilitating a comprehensive comprehension of the intricate elements that impact flight cost. Moreover, the suggested approach places significant emphasis on precisely predicting upcoming occurrences in real-time, facilitating prompt reactions to market volatility and offering a valuable resource for airlines, travel agents, and customers alike. In order to enhance the accuracy of real-time forecasts, we utilize a web-based platform that allows for smooth interaction with live data streams and guarantees swift updates.

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving significant breakthroughs in computer vision and image processing. However, there are still many challenges in rendering complex scenes, particularly generating and controlling images for extreme weather conditions. In this work, we propose a novel generative model based on ControlNet and achieve precise control and high-quality rendering of extreme weather features by combining a sparsely connected Squeeze-and-Excitation module with a zero-convolution design. The proposed model excels in generating highly realistic extreme weather scenes, including heavy rain and snow, while significantly enhancing the ability to fine-tune weather characteristic parameters. Experimental results validate the model's exceptional generation quality and robust control stability, which not only realistically reproduces complex weather scenes but also allows flexible adjustments to weather characteristics such as rainfall intensity, snowflake density, and flame range. Compared to previous methods, the model demonstrates substantial improvements in image detail fidelity, weather feature consistency and generation efficiency. This technology shows immense potential for applications in disaster simulation and early warning systems.},

  pages={2743-2747},
  abstract={Cross-modal hashing has achieved significant progress in recent years. However, how to effectively learn more discriminative hash codes of each modality and simultaneous alleviate the loss of modality information is still a challenging problem. Focusing on this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-modal hashing approach named Semantic Preserving Generative Adversarial Network (SPGAN). The overall network architecture consists of two sub-networks, i.e., a semantic preserving generative adversarial network module and a discriminative hashing module. The generator maps text features into the image feature space. And the discriminator judges whether the feature representations are real image features or generated image features. The adversarial learning process can effectively reduce modality difference and preserve information of the image modality as much as possible. The discriminative hashing module projects the real and generated image features into a Hamming space to obtain hash codes, and explores semantic similarities for enhancing the discriminant ability of hash codes. Experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that SPGAN can outperform state-of-the-art related works.},

  abstract={The exponential expansion of generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) has led to a marked increase in energy usage and carbon emissions. This exploratory study hypothesizes that enhancing the mental health of AI systems can mitigate energy consumption. By drawing parallels between AI challenges, such as attention scatter, computational dyscalculia, and overfitting-and human mental disorders, we seek to develop novel strategies for optimizing AI efficiency. We propose that incorporating psychiatric expertise during AI training and development could steer models towards more energy-efficient operations, potentially revolutionizing training methodologies in the forthcoming years. These AI-related issues contribute to operational inefficiencies, prompting frequent algorithmic adjustments and heightened computational resource demands. Improving the management of these challenges within AI could reduce errors and redundant processes, refine decision-making, and lessen the necessity for retraining. We assessed the environmental impact of Gen-AI, focusing on energy expenditures during training and inference phases. For instance, training models like GPT-3 reportedly consume approximately 1,287 megawatt-hours, with ongoing inference contributing to even higher emissions. We contend that enhancing AI mental health and utilizing algorithms such as CarbonMin-which allocate computational tasks to regions with lower carbon footprints-can significantly reduce emissions by an estimated 35% currently and up to 71% by 2035. Advancements in hardware and software efficiencies could further diminish the carbon footprint by as much as a thousandfold compared to traditional models. This preliminary research suggests that integrating psychiatric principles into AI development could optimize performance and substantially lower energy consumption and carbon emissions, unveiling new avenues for future investigation.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can significantly improve cyber security operations if tasks and responsibilities are effectively shared between human and machine. AI techniques excel in some situational understanding tasks; for instance, classifying intrusions. However, existing AI systems are often overconfident in their classification: this reduces the trust of human analysts. Furthermore, sophisticated intrusions span across long time periods to reduce their footprint, and each decision to respond to a (suspected) attack can have unintended side effects. In this position paper we show how advanced AI systems handling uncertainty and encompassing expert knowledge can lessen the burden on human analysts. In detail: (1) Effective interaction with the analyst is a key issue for the success of an intelligence support system. This involves two issues: a clear and unambiguous system-analyst communication, only possible if both share the same domain ontology and conceptual framework, and effective interaction, allowing the analyst to query the system for justifications of the reasoning path followed and the results obtained. (2) Uncertainty-aware machine learning and reasoning is an effective method for anomaly detection, which can provide human operators with alternative interpretations of data with an accurate assessment of their confidence. This can contribute to reducing misunderstandings and building trust. (3) An event-processing algorithm including both a neural and a symbolic layer can help identify attacks spanning long intervals of time, that would remain undetected via a pure neural approach. (4) Such a symbolic layer is crucial for the human operator to estimate the appropriateness of possible responses to a suspected attack by considering both the probability that an attack is actually occurring and the impact (intended and unintended) of a given response.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is derived from the application of AI to produce works of original art including music, films, and images. Moreover, tailored Ads that are more suitable to specific viewers are produced using generative AI. But it is crucial to think about the moral complications of utilizing generative AI in streaming video. There are some issues that include data security, privacy, and the possibility of manipulating or misusing AI -generated information. So, we developed an effective Ad generation model using deep learning to tackle the existing challenges. Initially, the data is taken from the benchmark sources and given into the FAST process. Here, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model is used for the FAST process to generate Ads. The model offers the effectual outcome after completing the process. Then, the effectiveness of the developed model is compared with several existing models to showcase the superiority over other models accurately.},

  abstract={Recent artificial intelligence (AI) developments in the way machines learn have now made it possible for AI to generate media content-image, sound, and text. The highly realistic output of AI-generated media content implants the question of whether we can still tell the difference between what is AI or human. In consequence, this paper explores the socio-ethical implications of this type of content. As a starting point for the discussion, an illustrative experiment packaged as a game of trivia was conducted and played by 2383 participants which generated a total of 24502 guesses in differentiating between AI or humans. The socio-ethical analysis provides insights into how this phenomenon unfolds and its implications for our future.},

  abstract={The emerging concept of delivering Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) foresees the deployment and reconfiguration of the next-generation networks, such as 6G, in a dynamic and elastic manner, tailored to the respective stakeholder’s intention. Taking this into account, the efficient management and orchestration of both telecommunication and computational resources across the network domains, i.e. access, transport and core presents a considerable challenge, even for network experts. To tackle this complexity, this paper explores the implementation of an intent-based management framework. The framework receives a high-level description of the desired network capabilities along with supplementary files, e.g. deployment descriptors, and translates them into configuration files consumable by the network itself. In order to achieve this, the paper establishes a translation pipeline that leverages the employment of emerging multimodal generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), and open industry-ready standard templates. The adoption of those two emerging technologies offers high dynamicity on the interpretation process of the user’s intent, while ensuring that its outcome is compatible with every orchestrator or next-generation Operating Support System (Next-gen OSS) that adheres to those standards.},

  abstract={A unique cognitive capability of humans consists in their ability to acquire new knowledge and skills from a sequence of experiences. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence systems are good at learning only the last given task without being able to remember the databases learnt in the past. We propose a novel lifelong learning methodology by employing a Teacher-Student network framework. While the Student module is trained with a new given database, the Teacher module would remind the Student about the information learnt in the past. The Teacher, implemented by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), is trained to preserve and replay past knowledge corresponding to the probabilistic representations of previously learnt databases. Meanwhile, the Student module is implemented by a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) which infers its latent variable representation from both the output of the Teacher module as well as from the newly available database. Moreover, the Student module is trained to capture both continuous and discrete underlying data representations across different domains. The proposed lifelong learning framework is applied in supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised training.},

  abstract={This study explores the application of intelligent Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in illustration design and cultural and creative product design in Liaoning. It aims to enhance design efficiency and quality while promoting the inheritance and innovation development of local cultural heritage. The study employs CycleGAN combined with self-attention mechanisms to conduct style transfer experiments on cultural illustrations featuring Liaoning’s regional characteristics. It compares the performance of six models, including traditional GAN, CycleGAN, and CycleGAN + Self-attention, in terms of image quality and training efficiency. The results show that the CycleGAN + Self-attention model outperforms others in image quality indicators (PSNR and SSIM). On the Liaoning illustration dataset, this model achieves a PSNR of 30.5 dB and an SSIM of 0.96, which are 10 dB and 0.21 higher than traditional GANs. Tests across diverse datasets also demonstrate its robust generalization and adaptability. The proposed CycleGAN + Self-attention model performs well in illustration and cultural product design, generating high-quality illustrations with local cultural features. Beyond enhancing design efficiency, this model offers new technical means for cultural inheritance. Overall, this study furnishes novel ideas and methods for integrating intelligent GANs into art design practices. It helps promote Liaoning’s cultural heritage and innovation, and supports the development of the cultural and creative industry.},

  abstract={Since the public release of ChatGPT in late 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) as a form of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) have emerged as a transformative technology with the potential to create value across diverse domains. A central new practice is prompting: articulating requirements in the form of instructions to conversational agents via natural language. The challenges faced by innovators, especially non-technical ones, in adopting these new tools are unknown. Social workers, professionals who serve society’s most vulnerable members, have historically been reluctant to embrace new technologies. This paper presents examples and lessons learned from introducing social work students to LLMs, and prompting specifically, via the development of custom conversational agents. Participants (n = 28) created CustomGPTs tailored to their professional use cases, engaging in a guided process to design and refine the prompts. We describe our approach, report the cases, and examine challenges. These insights can inform the training of future innovators, the evolution of conversational agent platforms to better support the creation of robust, trustworthy AI tools by non-technical users, and serve as empirical data for innovator involvement in the requirements engineering process.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been a proliferation of Edge Intelligence (EI) services, especially within Internet of Vehicles (IoV) scenarios, accompanied by a growing demand for multi-modal content generation. In response, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has emerged as a promising solution, equipping EI to produce diverse Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) for ubiquitous edge services. However, existing cloud-based GAI capabilities, which are mostly provided via the web and the Internet, introduce unacceptable latency overhead and heightened security risks for vehicular services. To address the above shortcomings and the lack of endogenous mechanisms for applying GAI to IoV scenarios, in this paper, we propose a layered vehicular GAI framework that seamlessly integrates GAI and EI. Within this framework, we devise a distributed collaborative inference mechanism between Road-Side Units (RSUs) and vehicles. Furthermore, we formulate the shared and local inference splitting problem, a pivotal challenge influencing both GAI service latency and content-generation capability. To tackle this issue, we introduce a backward induction-based algorithm, which enables the system can make splitting decisions using a simple threshold-based policy. Simulation results underscore the remarkable performance of the proposed system and vehicular collaborative inference mechanism, promising to facilitate diverse content generation within vehicular networks.},

Accretor demonstrates a tangled continuity between digital and physical domains, where the constraints and affordances of matter inform both formal processes and aesthetic interpretations. Drawing on Arp's notion of the concrete artwork and McCormack and Dorin's notion of the computational sublime, the article finally argues that Accretor demonstrates what might be called a processual sublime, evoking expansive processes that span both computational and non-computational systems.},

  abstract={Data-driven fault diagnosis of high impedance fault (HIF) has received increasing attention and achieved fruitful results. However, HIF data is difficult to obtain in engineering. Furthermore, there exists an imbalance between the fault data and non-fault data, making data-driven methods hard to detect HIFs reliably under the small imbalanced sample condition. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel HIF diagnosis method based on conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WCGAN). By adversarial training, WCGAN can generate sufficient labeled zero-sequence current signals, which can expand the limited training set and achieve the balanced distribution of the samples. In addition, the Wasserstein distance was introduced to improve the loss function. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can generate high-quality samples and achieve a high accuracy rate of fault detection in the case of small imbalanced samples.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) trends vary significantly across global regions, shaping the trajectory of innovation, regulation, and societal impact. This variation influences how different regions approach AI development, balancing technological progress with ethical and regulatory considerations. This study conducts a comparative analysis of AI trends in the United States (US), the European Union (EU), and Asia, focusing on three key dimensions: generative AI, ethical oversight, and industrial applications. The US prioritizes market-driven innovation with minimal regulatory constraints, the EU enforces a precautionary risk-based framework emphasizing ethical safeguards, and Asia employs state-guided AI strategies that balance rapid deployment with regulatory oversight. Although these approaches reflect different economic models and policy priorities, their divergence poses challenges to international collaboration, regulatory harmonization, and the development of global AI standards. To address these challenges, this paper synthesizes regional strengths to propose an adaptive AI governance framework that integrates risk-tiered oversight, innovation accelerators, and strategic alignment mechanisms. By bridging governance gaps, this study offers actionable insights for fostering responsible AI development while ensuring a balance between technological progress, ethical imperatives, and regulatory coherence.},

  abstract={The future of Requirements Engineering (RE) is increasingly driven by artificial intelligence (AI), reshaping how we elicit, analyze, and validate requirements. Traditional RE is based on labor-intensive manual processes prone to errors and complexity. AI-powered approaches, specifically large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), and generative AI, offer transformative solutions and reduce inefficiencies. However, the use of AI in RE also brings challenges like algorithmic bias, lack of explainability, and ethical concerns related to automation. To address these issues, this study introduces the Human-AI RE Synergy Model (HARE-SM), a conceptual framework that integrates AI-driven analysis with human oversight to improve requirements elicitation, analysis, and validation. The model emphasizes ethical AI use through transparency, explainability, and bias mitigation. We outline a multi-phase research methodology focused on preparing RE datasets, fine-tuning AI models, and designing collaborative human-AI workflows. This preliminary study presents the conceptual framework and earlystage prototype implementation, establishing a research agenda and practical design direction for applying intelligent data science techniques to semi-structured and unstructured RE data in collaborative environments.},

  title={ICoT-GAN: Integrated Convolutional Transformer GAN for Rolling Bearings Fault Diagnosis Under Limited Data Condition}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={72},
  number={},
  pages={1-14},
  abstract={Limited operating data resulting from complex and changeable working conditions significantly undermines the performance of deep learning-based methods for rolling bearing fault diagnosis. Generally, this problem can be solved by using the generative adversarial network (GAN) to augment data. Most GAN-based methods, however, seldom comprehensively consider the global interactions and local dependencies in raw vibration signals during data generation, leading to a decline in the quality of the generated data and compromising the diagnostic accuracy. To address this problem, a fault diagnosis method based on integrated convolutional transformer GAN (ICoT-GAN) is proposed to improve the diagnostic performance under limited data conditions by generating high-quality signals. First, a new data augmentation model ICoT-GAN is developed. In ICoT-GAN, a novel ICoT block is designed to construct the generator and discriminator. The ICoT block achieves the integration of attention-based global information capture and convolution-based local feature extraction through the incorporation of convolution within the transformer encoder. This design allows the ICoT-GAN to comprehensively extract both global and local time-series features of raw signals and generate high-quality signals. Second, a novel data evaluation indicator, referred to as the multiple time-domain features indicator (MTFI), is designed to quantitatively evaluate generated signals’ quality by calculating the similarity of time-domain features between the real and generated signals. The MTFI can complement probability distribution indicators and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the data augmentation model’s generation ability by considering both time-series feature similarity and probability distribution differences. Finally, the effectiveness of our proposed method has been successfully demonstrated under limited data conditions using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and Center for Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS) bearing datasets. With only 16 training samples per class, our proposed method achieves diagnostic accuracy of 99.99% and 99.70%, respectively. Additionally, the data generation time is only 1163.31 s, indicating the efficiency of our proposed method.},

  abstract={Throughout the history of education, one of the most important questions has been whether we can detect whether students are cheating on exams or whether we are really assessing their knowledge. One way to solve this dilemma is to adopt an approach where professors spend more time helping students to learn rather than finding out whether students are cheating on exams. It should also be remembered that the exam is a time to learn, not just a time to check what has been learnt. Based on these approaches, an analysis of the use of generative AI applications and tools in engineering education was carried out on the subject of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). Students are allowed to use generative AI applications and tools to solve tasks in exams and colloquia. Some of the results of using generative AI applications and tools are presented in this paper.},

  abstract={The application of AI, or artificial intelligence, offers a novel opportunity to advance generative design in a number of mobility-related fields. The method allows for the creation of parts to be completed in a shorter time frame and has the objective of achieving multiple sustainability goals with minimal information provided at the outset. This article will present a practical case study of this method on an automotive Engine mounting bracket, a complex part that must meet a range of requirements, including those related to rigidity, strength; and sustainability. The initial 3D model will define the space constraints (design space), operating conditions, and objectives to be achieved. These may include, for example, improvements in rigidity, lightweighting and fatigue, reductions in CO2 impact, and improvements in autonomy. The result is a set of designs that respect the constraints and maximize the objectives. Subsequently, the designer may select the design that is most aligned with their preferences, taking into account additional considerations such as manufacturing simplicity, or cost. A comparative analysis was conducted between generative design and traditional design, which relies on human expertise, CAD (computer-aided design) tools, and algorithms. The weight, deformation, stress, fatigue, CO2 emissions and self-sufficiency performance of the two methods were evaluated. It was found that generative design allows for a 30% reduction in the weight of the part compared to traditional design, while simultaneously improving its rigidity and strength. The total weight reduction of many brackets for the same vehicle also results in a decrease in CO2 by 3.5 g/km and an increase in autonomy by 2.8 km.},

  abstract={In recent years, text-to-image as an important research direction of multimodal technology, are widely used in design, education and other fields. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has become a mainstream method due to its powerful generative capability, but still faces problems such as mode collapse, semantic consistency and image quality. In this paper, we propose an improved DF-GAN model that introduces a word-level attention mechanism to enhance textual information utilization, and adds diversity loss to the generator loss function to mitigate mode collapse. Experimental results show that the improved model significantly improves image generation quality and semantic consistency on the CUB and COCO datasets, and the FID is reduced by 7.29% and 4.55% respectively compared to the baseline model. The ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of the diversity loss and word-level attention mechanisms. Future research can further explore more efficient attention mechanisms and more stable training methods.},

  year={2021},
  volume={30},

  pages={3650-3663},
  abstract={Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) is a useful but challenging task. It is a promising idea to design BIQA methods by mimicking the working mechanism of human visual system (HVS). The internal generative mechanism (IGM) indicates that the HVS actively infers the primary content (i.e., meaningful information) of an image for better understanding. Inspired by that, this paper presents a novel BIQA metric by mimicking the active inference process of IGM. Firstly, an active inference module based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) is established to predict the primary content, in which the semantic similarity and the structural dissimilarity (i.e., semantic consistency and structural completeness) are both considered during the optimization. Then, the image quality is measured on the basis of its primary content. Generally, the image quality is highly related to three aspects, i.e., the scene information (content-dependency), the distortion type (distortion-dependency), and the content degradation (degradation-dependency). According to the correlation between the distorted image and its primary content, the three aspects are analyzed and calculated respectively with a multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) based quality evaluator. As a result, with the help of the primary content obtained from the active inference and the comprehensive quality degradation measurement from the multi-stream CNN, our method achieves competitive performance on five popular IQA databases. Especially in cross-database evaluations, our method achieves significant improvements.},

  abstract={This study examines the privacy implications associated with the intersection of Gen-AI in wearable health devices. Wearables have the potential to revolutionize healthcare for predictive diagnoses. This technological intersection has privacy concerns. Generative AI is trained using a large amount of data that has ethical considerations. The objective of this research is to explore the privacy implications using Generative AI in wearable healthcare devices where consumer trust is concerned. The study is based on mixed method approach. Through a thorough review of literature and primary data collected from 90 wearable device users, the study highlights the dual nature of Gen AI, wearables of health monitoring and privacy concerns. The results indicate that there are security implications for the use of Generative AI in wearables. The study summarizes that users should be made aware of the privacy implications of their data collection when they use the devices regularly as the collected information is personal. It is suggested that companies developing wearable devices should aim to build transparent privacy policies in the context of consumer awareness of data protection for the use of data generated by smart devices. The study contributes to the literature on wearable devices and their data usage by revealing the impact of privacy concerns.},

  abstract={The evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds colossal promise for automating tasks, driving innovation, and positively impacting industries. However, as AI becomes increasingly pervasive, it is crucial to establish trust in algorithmic decision-making, eliminating bias and ensuring fair outcomes. Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to AI systems, with backdoor attacks emerging as a potent form of attack. Consequently, it becomes imperative to focus research efforts on mitigating discrimination and bias in AI models, emphasising ethical considerations and model interpretability. Adversarial machine learning (AML) is a critical field within AI that specifically addresses the vulnerabilities and countermeasures associated with the manipulation and subversion of machine learning models by adversarial actors. Previous research on AML focused on model vulnerabilities, attacks, and defences. However, the next phase of AML should incorporate human elements into AI design to address inherent social and demographic bias. The primary goal of this paper is to study to the field by conducting a systematic analysis of current trends, identifying future research directions, and proposing strategies to address and mitigate racial bias in generative image models. Furthermore, our aim is to foster social diversity and promote fairness in AI-generated outcomes.},

  abstract={The emergence of autonomous driving vehicles provides a more convenient and comfortable transportation experience for human society, but it also brings some safety hazards. In recent years, due to the inherent limitations of autonomous driving algorithms, self-driving cars have been involved in multiple traffic accidents during lane-changing scenarios. To address this issue, there is a need to propose a method for generating lane-changing trajectories with specific risk levels to assist autonomous driving algorithms in conducting safety tests, thereby enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles. This paper utilizes a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to extract risk features from lane-changing scenarios and applies an autoencoder along with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to learn from and generate lane-changing data with specific risks. Additionally, an evaluation method has been proposed to verify the authenticity, diversity, and similarity of the generated data.},

  abstract={In an era where generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping industries, public understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. This study addresses this gap by analyzing public beliefs about GenAI using the Technology Acceptance Model and Diffusion of Innovations Theory as frameworks. We adopted a big-data approach, utilizing machine-learning techniques to analyze 21,817 public comments extracted from an initial set of 32,707 on 44 YouTube videos discussing GenAI. Our investigation surfaced six pivotal themes: concerns over job and economic impacts, GenAI's potential to revolutionize problem-solving, its perceived shortcomings in creativity and emotional intelligence, the proliferation of misinformation, existential risks, and privacy decay. Emotion analysis showed that negative emotions dominated at 58.46%, including anger (22.85%) and disgust (17.26%). Sentiment analysis echoed this negativity, with 70% negative. The triangulation of thematic, emotional, and sentiment analyses highlighted a polarized public stance: recognition of GenAI's transformative potential is tempered by significant concerns about its implications. The findings offer actionable insights for engineering managers and policymakers. Strategies such as awareness-building, transparency, public engagement, balanced communication, governance, and human-centered development can address polarization and build trust. Ongoing research into public opinion remains essential for aligning technological advancements with societal expectations and acceptance.},

By constructing a dynamic knowledge space network, the system combines multimodal data (learning behaviors, physiological signals) for high-precision diagnostics and employs reinforcement learning algorithms to dynamically plan personalized learning paths. Leveraging the open-ended problem-solving and resource-generation capabilities of generative AI, the system significantly enhances content adaptability and interactive flexibility. Experimental validation demonstrates that the system effectively optimizes learning efficiency and knowledge mastery while supporting teachers in making precise decisions. The system exhibits broad cross-domain applicability in basic education, corporate training, and special education. Future research will further integrate explainable AI and brain computer interface (BCI) technologies to advance educational intelligence toward transparency and real-time adaptability.},

  title={A Novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Framework for an In-Vehicle Controller Area Network Intrusion Detection}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={96081-96092},
  abstract={In-vehicle controller area network (CAN) is susceptible to various cyberattacks due to its broadcast-based communication nature. An attacker can inject false messages to a vehicle’s CAN via wireless communication, the infotainment system, or the onboard diagnostic port. Thus, an effective intrusion detection system is essential to distinguish authentic CAN messages from false ones. In this study, we developed a hybrid quantum-classical CAN intrusion detection framework using a classical neural network (NN) and a quantum restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). The classical NN is dedicated to feature extraction from CAN images generated from a vehicle’s CAN bus data. In contrast, the quantum RBM is dedicated to CAN image reconstruction for classification-based intrusion detection. The novelty of the study lies in utilizing the generative ability of an RBM to reconstruct the pixels in a CAN image, a portion of which is dedicated to labeling. Then, that portion of the reconstructed image is used to classify the image as an attack image or a normal image. To evaluate the performance of the hybrid quantum-classical CAN intrusion detection framework, we used a real-world CAN fuzzy attack dataset to create three separate attack datasets, where each dataset represents a unique set of features related to the vehicle. We compared the performance of our hybrid framework to a similar but classical-only framework. Our analyses showed that the hybrid framework performs better in CAN intrusion detection compared to the classical-only framework. For the three datasets considered in this study, the best models in the hybrid framework achieved 97.5%, 97%, and 98.3% intrusion detection accuracies and 94.7%, 93.9%, and 97.2% recalls, respectively. In contrast, the best models in the classical-only framework achieved 92.5%, 95%, and 93.3% intrusion detection accuracies and 84.2%, 89.8%, and 88.9% recalls, respectively.},

  abstract={Generative adversarial networks (GAN) are an emerging technology in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). It is an unsupervised learning framework that involves automatically learning a model from input data to produce a synthetic output that closely resembles the original input. GANs create datasets by making copies of false outputs based on specific inputs. GANs allow machines to generate unique content that is different from human-generated data. GANs are widely used in various image-related fields, such as image-to-text conversion, next-generation faces, high-resolution image conversion, etc. The general growth of artificial intelligence and its medical applications is increasing the efficiency of the healthcare system for patients who need rapid care. Chronic diseases, especially stroke, are now the leading cause of death worldwide. Diagnosis of stroke is often based on imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, CT scans are more common and readily available in many African hospitals, especially in Senegal. However, the need for rapid image interpretation of stroke is sometimes problematic due to variable image quality, highlighting the need for improvements to achieve better image quality. This article focuses on improving the resolution of CT images, a commonly used method in medical imaging. However, obtaining a high-quality CT scan often requires lengthy wait times and the use of limited laboratory equipment. In addition, radioactive radiation poses health risks and results in poorer image quality. Super-resolution GAN has the potential to solve this problem. Super-resolution is a method of generating high-resolution images from low-resolution images. We use the input CT dataset to generate higher quality images while keeping parameters unchanged. We found that using ResNet with GANs produced higher quality images than the original input images.},

  abstract={Deep generative vision models are now able to synthesize realistic-looking satellite imagery. However, the possibility of hallucinations prevents their adoption of risk-sensitive applications, such as generating materials for communicating climate change. To demonstrate this issue, we train a generative adversarial network (GAN, pix2pixHD) to create synthetic satellite imagery of future flooding and reforestation events. We find that a pure deep learning-based model can generate photorealistic flood visualizations but hallucinate floods at locations that are not susceptible to flooding. To address this issue, we propose to condition and evaluate generative vision models on segmentation maps of physics-based flood models. We show that our physics-conditioned model outperforms the pure deep learning-based model and a handcrafted baseline. We evaluate the generalization capability of our method to different remote sensing data and different climate-related events (reforestation). We publish our code and dataset which includes the data for a third case study of melting Arctic sea ice and >30 000 labeled HD image triplets—or the equivalent of 5.5 million images at  $128 \times 128$  pixels—for segmentation guided image-to-image (im2im) translation in Earth observation.

  year={2023},
  volume={11},

  pages={5144-5160},
  abstract={Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly being explored and used for a variety of classification tasks in medical imaging, but current methods for post hoc explainability are limited. Most commonly used methods highlight portions of the input image that contribute to classification. While this provides a form of spatial localization relevant for focal disease processes, it may not be sufficient for co-localized or diffuse disease processes such as pulmonary edema or fibrosis. For the latter, new methods are required to isolate diffuse texture features employed by the CNN where localization alone is ambiguous. We therefore propose a novel strategy for eliciting explainability, called Feature Interpretation using Generative Adversarial Networks (FIGAN), which provides visualization of features used by a CNN for classification or regression. FIGAN uses a conditional generative adversarial network to synthesize images that span the range of a CNN’s principal embedded features. We apply FIGAN to two previously developed CNNs and show that the resulting feature interpretations can clarify ambiguities within attention areas highlighted by existing explainability methods. In addition, we perform a series of experiments to study the effect of auxiliary segmentations, training sample size, and image resolution on FIGAN’s ability to provide consistent and interpretable synthetic images.},

  abstract={Commercial utilization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is expanding rapidly. However, few studies have investigated the transformative impact of GAI on business operations, with a specific focus on research and development (R&D) and advertising facilitated by AI-generated content (AIGC) empowerment; particularly, there is a lack of analysis on the impact of AIGC iteration on firms’ decision-making. The study uses the optimal control and learning-by-doing method to examine two types of AIGC strategies, the single AIGC (enhancing R&D exclusively) and the dual AIGC (simultaneously boosting R&D and advertising), to delve into their dynamic iteration effects on firms’ performance. Our findings reveal that, under the single AIGC strategy, focusing on investments in the AI training R&D sector alone can enhance the GAI smartness level more effectively than adopting the dual AIGC strategy. Conversely, under the dual AIGC strategy, firms initially tend to select GAI empowerment toward the downstream advertising sector more than the upstream R&D sector. Both strategies demonstrate enhanced profits and increased demand with higher rates of AIGC self-learning. Notably, considering the limited budget, firms prioritize allocating AI training resources to the R&D sector under the dual AIGC strategy, guaranteeing their long-term success.},

It reveals prevalent issues such as exogenous learning motivation, inefficient strategy execution, and inadequate reflection mechanisms. Based on Zimmerman's Self-Regulated Learning Model, three-stage application strategies are proposed: activating learning interest and establishing personalized learning paths in the forethought stage; recommending intelligent learning resources and adjusting learning strategies in the performance stage; and evaluating autonomous learning effects and reflecting on the learning process in the self-reflection stage. To validate the effectiveness of these strategies, a controlled experiment and qualitative interviews were designed. The research confirms that GAI-enabled application strategies for autonomous learning can provide personalized guidance and support to university students, enhancing their autonomous learning outcomes.},

  abstract={Learning programming in higher education faces significant challenges, including high dropout rates and difficulties in understanding abstract concepts. Previous studies have explored various teaching methods, but the effectiveness of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in this context has not yet been widely investigated. This study compares the efficacy of GenAI with video-based active learning methods for teaching programming to university students. Through an experimental design with 40 computer engineering students, academic performance, perception of usefulness and ease of use, and satisfaction and motivation were evaluated. The results showed no statistically significant differences between the groups in academic performance, perception of usefulness and ease of use, or satisfaction and motivation. Both methods proved equally effective in improving learning and maintaining student motivation. These findings suggest that GenAI can be a viable alternative to traditional methods, offering opportunities to diversify pedagogical strategies in programming education. Educators are encouraged to consider integrating GenAI to complement existing methods, ensuring implementation that maintains high levels of perceived control, immersion, and curiosity among students.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), with its powerful text generation capabilities, has shown significant potential in the field of education. This study focuses on the application of GAI in programming education, aiming to explore its impact on enhancing students' computational thinking.

To address this gap, this study proposes a project-based learning model that integrates GAI to enhance students' computational thinking. The model is constructed by analyzing the components of computational thinking, the key elements of project-based learning, and the potential roles of GAI in this context. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a quasi-experimental study was conducted. Independent samples t-tests were used to compare pre- and post-test results. The findings revealed a significant improvement in students' computational thinking after participating in the GAI-enhanced project-based learning activities. Specifically, significant differences were observed in the sub-dimensions of creativity, algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving ability. However, no significant differences were found in the sub-dimensions of collaborative ability and critical thinking.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of the digital creative industry, there has been a dramatic surge in the demand for processing massive amounts of data and generating personalized visual content. Traditional visual image generation technologies struggle to meet these demands, particularly in terms of detail representation, semantic consistency, and the efficiency of image generation. In this study, we propose a method based on a Dynamic Attention-enhanced Generative Adversarial Network (DA-GAN). By constructing a network architecture that includes a progressive upsampling generator embedded with a CBAM module and a discriminator combining PatchGAN with global average pooling, we optimize the model using an improved Wasserstein GAN adversarial loss, a perceptual loss based on a pre-trained VGG-19 model, and a style loss calculated via the Gram matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to methods such as StyleGAN2 and SAGAN, DA-GAN achieves significant improvements in metrics like PSNR and SSIM, exhibits a lower FID value, and generates images with richer details and stronger semantic consistency. Additionally, DA-GAN offers notable advantages in computational efficiency and exhibits lower growth in memory consumption. This study provides an effective solution to the challenges faced by traditional visual image generation technologies in detail representation, semantic consistency, and generation efficiency, with broad application prospects.},
