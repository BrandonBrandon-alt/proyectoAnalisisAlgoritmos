  pages={480-489},
  abstract={The unprecedented circumstances encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic in a variety of life aspects such as health, economy, and environment have urged the humanity to devise new solutions to control and mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Motivated by the high-accuracy decision-making capabilities of artificial intelligence, this article aims to highlight the effectiveness of artificial intelligence applications in the areas of virus detection, health monitoring, face mask detection, crowd sensing, and satellite-based environment monitoring. One of the most promising deep learning techniques presented in the literature is the convolutional neural network (CNN) that has shown remarkable classification accuracy. The reason for using artificial intelligence in this area is the inherent difficulty of these applications such as detecting COVID-19 infections using lung images due to its resemblance with other respiratory diseases. While the lack of sufficient training data is considered one of the main difficulties, it has been alleviated with the aid of specialized artificial intelligence techniques such as generative adversarial networks and transfer learning. Satellite-based imagery along with deep learning have shown an improvement in the air quality due to the imposed mobility restrictions during the pandemic. Apart from the technical challenges, some applications faced social and ethical challenges that are mainly related to the patient privacy. The latter factor have made dataset availability more limited, and restricted the implementation of some applications such as contact tracing. This work examines state-of-the-art studies and shows the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in solving the most challenging technical problems encountered during the pandemic.},

  abstract={In the pursuit of a more inclusive, equitable, and diverse workplace, many organizations are turning to artificial intelligence as a transformative approach to enhance hiring practices. By automating resume evaluations, AI systems can reduce the impact of human biases that often lead to the underrepresentation of certain demographic groups. However, the use of AI in recruitment presents its own set of challenges, including the potential for biased algorithms, lack of transparency, and over-reliance on automation. This paper explores the benefits, challenges, and limitations of using AI to assess resumes, with a particular focus on how AI can enhance EDI in hiring practices. Through the review of various AI tools and case studies, the paper examines how AI can be leveraged to promote fairness, consistency, and access to diverse talent pools. Additionally, the paper discusses solutions to mitigate the risks of bias, such as diversifying training datasets, increasing transparency through explainable AI models, and ensuring human oversight in decision-making. Ultimately, this paper provides recommendations for organizations seeking to integrate AI into their recruitment process while ensuring that it fosters an inclusive and equitable hiring environment.},

  abstract={The gaming industry continually faces the challenge of high costs and extensive time requirements for producing 2D assets. Gaming studies hire and pay high costs to artists to create images for the game which is also time consuming. With the pervasive integration of artificial intelligence across various sectors, the application of AI in game development presents a promising solution to these challenges. This study focuses on the comparison and outcomes of two advanced generative AI tools, DALL-E and Midjourney, to reduce the time and cost associated with the creation of dynamic 2D game assets. The comparison process for both the AI tools involves creation of a Unity based game that integrates DALL-E and Midjourney to generate dynamic game assets which were used in the gameplay to get the user feedback inside the game. The findings reveal that both DALL-E and Midjourney significantly reduce the time and financial barriers traditionally associated with game asset creation, democratizing game development and allowing smaller studios to produce competitive content. DALL-E was found to be highly effective in rapidly transforming textual descriptions into high-quality visual assets, making it superior in terms of speed and cost-efficiency compared to Midjourney. Player feedback indicated a higher level of satisfaction and engagement with DALL-E-generated assets, particularly due to its superior performance in handling prompts and generating contextually relevant images.},

  abstract={The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to reshape the creative landscape of filmmaking, particularly in the domain of screenwriting. Once relegated to speculative fiction, AI now emerges as a practical co-creator, offering tools capable of generating compelling narratives from minimal input. This study explores the evolving role of AI in screenwriting by evaluating story outputs generated by Bard AI against those written by human screenwriters. Using a structured, two-phase research design, the investigation compares the narratives based on five qualitative variables: plot, narration, character development, dialogue, and cultural relevance. A three-tiered input strategy—ranging from basic to extended prompts—was adopted to assess the AI's creative flexibility and responsiveness. Results show that while AI-generated stories demonstrate coherence, stylistic fluency, and efficient scene setting, they fall short in emotional depth, cultural nuance, and imaginative progression. Human-written scripts, though less structured, excel in dialogue and subtextual character portrayal. The findings highlight the potential of AI as a valuable tool in early-stage ideation and structural support, especially for Gen Z creators, while reaffirming the irreplaceable role of human imagination in storytelling. This research advocates for a hybrid screenwriting model, where AI serves as a creative assistant rather than a substitute for human authorship.},

  abstract={This work explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve research skills in engineering education, specifically at the time of conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). While AI has previously been employed for basic tasks related to SLRs, such as relevant paper screening and classification within scope, there is still limited research on information retrieval from the full texts of scientific papers. This study focuses on the next phase in the SLR, which involves scientific documentary analysis. The methodology presented in this work compares the AI tools in the market to facilitate scientific documentary analysis and enhance and refine research skills in engineering students. Also, this paper addresses the challenges to automatically run documentary analysis during a SLR. To do so, several techniques to extract information from AIs are presented, including Application Programming Interfaces (API) or Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). According to the results, most of the AI tools have a limitation in the operations students can perform per day. Only PDFgear offers a no-cost solution with unlimited usage, while some other AI tools allow limited usage for not so high prize. In conclusion, this paper presents a contribution during the documentary analysis of a SLR. It is important to keep in mind the constraints associated with the limited usage of AIs, the accuracy of AI tools, or the complexity of the developed scripts for automating the process. Due to the rapidly changing market for artificial intelligence, the validity of this study is limited to the current state of the tools. Similar studies will be necessary as AI tools continue to evolve.},

We ask: can these tools administer some overdue shock treatment to the neglected domain of electricity grid aesthetics? At a moment when artificial intelligence’s role in mainstream creative professions is hotly debated, we target instead the uncontested design backwater that is the aesthetics of physical energy infrastructure. Can these destablising new tools of visual propaganda upend the negligent status quo within electrical engineering; might they infuse (some artificial approximation of) creativity, beauty and panache into the staid paradigm of “least cost/technically acceptable” grid infrastructure design? Creative professionals seem largely uninterested in the question of how to construct attractive energy infrastructure; how might we deploy generative artificial intelligence against this aesthetic abdication, to (synthetically) imagine power systems beyond the drab hegemony of grey steel? Can flawed artificial imagination goad human designers into applying authentic creativity?},

  abstract={Hotels have benefitted from increased operational effectiveness, personalization and decision making brought on by Generative AI. This advance has enabled distinct industries the operational effectiveness they desperately needed. This research uses the motivational and job satisfaction impact of the Generative AI on employees in Contexts looking at early stage versus long established hotels. Incorporated style hotels have differing operational challenges than open hotels. For example, hotels that are already operational must focus on maintaining the same if not better service consistently, while new hotels are unclear on their workflows and have stricter timelines to meet. Efforts involving predictive analytics, automated content generation, and AI driven decision making may transform the landscape by ensuring effective modernization, boosting innovation, and minimizing the workload and operational challenges. This particular research uses the mixed methods strategies incorporating methods like in depth interviews and surveys with pre opened and more established hotels. With both qualitative and quantitative data sets collected to meet research objectives, the team used standard instruments to gather data on employee job satisfaction and motivation. The key metrics which one will focus on include role clarity, task efficiency, perceived career growth opportunities, and stress levels. The team significantly notes that the incorporation of Generative AI greatly adds value through efficiency in newly established hotels.},

  abstract={The new generation of generative artificial intelligence, represented by ChatGPT, is becoming a key engine to promote the digital economy by virtue of its excellent natural language interaction function and the convenience of multidomain generalization application. At the same time, the wide application of generative artificial intelligence in the fields of finance, medical care and industry makes it difficult for the traditional governance paradigm to adapt to the speed of its expansion and iteration, thus triggering ethical risks such as human subjectivity digestion, new alienation of human thinking, technology abuse, and digital exploitation. As a new governance paradigm in the post-public management era, holistic governance meets the needs of generative artificial intelligence ethical governance, and plans the generative artificial intelligence ethical governance with the overall concept and systematic thinking. Starting from the four logics of stakeholders, governance process, governance technology and governance rules, it constructs a holistic ethical governance framework led by the government, actively participated by scientific and technological innovation subjects, actively participated by scientific and technological social organizations, and spontaneously supervised by the public and the media, so as to jointly improve the ethical risk governance system and capacity modernization of generative artificial intelligence.},

  pages={49261-49274},
  abstract={Image-generating AI provides diverse sources for ideation in fashion design education. This study explores how collaborative fashion ideation with AI influences image thinking and creativity in a changing media environment. The research method employed design workshops and in-depth interviews with 10 students. The findings reveal that collaborative fashion ideation with AI influences image thinking through visual expansion, exploration of its applicability in fashion, and identifying and lack of sociocultural understanding and identity in idea combination. Collaborative fashion ideation with AI emphasizes creative properties, such as originality, fluency, and flexibility. The results of design workshops, evaluated by experts, indicate higher originality and novelty compared to the control group. The results imply that various factors, such as individual aesthetic presence and the identity of fashion brands, contribute to fashion ideation. Therefore, in collaborative ideation with AI, rather than relying solely on AI tools, it is essential to perceive and approach them as auxiliary tools. This study contributes to elucidating students’ image thinking and creative attributes in fashion ideation, highlighting the impact of collaborative ideation with AI.},

  abstract={How will national cybersecurity stakeholders react to increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) products in the decision-making loop? Diverse AI applications, already a component of military operations, stand to further revolutionize threat-intelligence analytics, curation, and presentation in years to come. In doing so, they portend heightened efficiency and higher tempos of security operations while minimizing risk potential. And yet, challenges abound. AI inputs to deliberative processes may be perceived as more or less robust, accurate, or generalizable according to a range of factors that influence decision-makers. Then these habits and preferences might be reintroduced to the information loop in several ways, as the algorithm, the design/implementation process, and institutions adapt to accommodate the human element. Malicious actors are even likely to target this action-reaction loop to influence AI systems. This two-phase cycle is perhaps most worrisome in relation to cyber conflict, where informational ambiguity, functionally diverse workforces, and an expansive and fragmented threat environment combine to produce an immense opportunity for baking bias into the loop. This paper presents the results of two experiments designed to explore different manifestations of AI systems in the cyber conflict decision-making loop. Though findings suggest that technical expertise positively impacts respondents’ ability to gauge the potential utility and credibility of an input (indicating that training can, in fact, overcome decision-maker bias), the perception of human agency in the loop even in the presence of AI inputs mitigates this cautionary effect and makes decision-makers more willing to operate on less overall information.},

  abstract={In recent years, generative AI models such as ChatGPT, based on Transformer architectures, have developed rapidly and become a hot topic in society. They are widely used in programming, audio, and video processing fields, significantly enhancing productivity in these areas. However, various problems have also arisen during their application. At its core, generative AI still relies on symbolic formal logic and lacks the ability to simulate human cognitive patterns of understanding the world through prior logic or even dialectical logic. As such, it is impossible for these systems to achieve strong artificial intelligence as we know it. Currently, computer systems are founded on discrete mathematics and symbolic logic. This paper proposes an idea that combines prior logic theory with object-oriented programming techniques, using categorical judgment methods as a foundation to mimic human cognition patterns and discusses a possibility of approaching the realization of strong artificial intelligence.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present the results achieved by performing a test addressed to evaluate the capabilities of the so-called AI content Detectors or AI Detection Systems. Such systems promise to find out whether a given text was written by a human or created by an artificial intelligence (AI). The ability to identify the “synthetic” nature of a text is paramount in many workplaces as well as in the educational field, where we focused our research. More specifically, we considered the academic environment and the frequent request by faculty to students to write term papers on a wide variety of topics. Then, it is essential for teachers to be able to evaluate content quality as well as their authenticity. Until now, anti-plagiarism tools have been widely used to verify that homework assignments were not copied, but the recent advent of generative artificial intelligence-based tools changed the game, moving the focus to automatic generation. In both cases, we are facing a violation of the educational pact by a student, versus a teacher, if not outright an offence. Conversely, an unfounded accusation of fraud by a teacher toward a student would be equally serious. Therefore, to use automatic detection tools one must have a guarantee on the reliability of their output.},

  abstract={In recent years Artificial Intelligence (AI) has found its way into the creative and cultural industries, opening up new challenges and opportunities, poorly sufficiently explored today. However, when it comes to culture and creativity, many social and political cost factors should be taken into account. It is crucial to identify the opportunities that AI can offer in terms of the preservation, use, promotion, and accessibility of Cultural Heritage (CH). However, ethical concerns should be outlined when applying AI in cultural settings, such as for the digital replica of official UNESCO heritage sites or an unbiased explanation and interpretation of a work of art. This paper provides a first attempt to define the main ethical findings on this topic and propose it as an ethical framework to assess different risks arising from the use of AI in the CH domain. The application of this disruptive technology in the arts is evaluated through the lens of ethical principles for trustworthy AI and it explores whether the wider accessibility and improved preservation techniques enabled by AI come at some cost in terms of interpretation, social and cultural inclusion, subjectivism, or other forms of bias. The main ethical principles that emerge from the literature for the application of AI in the cultural domain are the following: Shared Responsibility, Meaningful Participation, Explainability, Accessibility, Sustainability, Reliability and Dignity. The findings underline the importance of establishing specific sectoral ethical guidelines for AI in the field of tangible and intangible CH to support and enhance its sustainable development without compromising its values, significance, sense of belonging and strong social impact.},

  abstract={Summary <p>In response to the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), during the 2022&#x2013;2023 school year, educators voiced concerns over plagiarism, cheating, and the futility of many of their traditional assignments. Conventional plagiarism detection methods became obsolete as generative AI produced individual responses for each student. The development of generative AI technology offers a path to offloading much of the workload that happens behind the scenes of instructional time. AI can help outline curriculum, draft lesson plans, generate assessments, and draft communication and feedback for teachers. One of the fears echoing from most industries is about the future of the workforce in the age of AI. This chapter offers a framework for thinking about how to integrate AI into the educational systems. As AI technologies continue to advance and become more prevalent, educators will need to be prepared to show examples of successful AI integration in education and preemptively answer questions and concerns from stakeholders.</p>},

  abstract={The advancements in automated problem-solving were explored by the agents of Artificial Intelligence (AI)Generated Content (AIGC). Although existing AIGC-based AI Agent systems can solve simple tasks, it is complicated to handle complex tasks due to inconsistent work logic. In this research, the operating mechanism of AI Agents was dissected to elucidate why AIGC is suitable as the foundation for AI Agents. Based on this technology, we proposed an AI Agent framework named SOP-GPT which has integrated the concept of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) from human workflow into AI Agents. SOP-GPT comprises three main elements: process, role, and skills. By combining the generative capability of AIGC with human SOP mechanisms, the quality of generation was enhanced to meet the expectations of human work requirements. We further explored how to assemble an AIGC engineering process for the division of labor and collaboration methods between various functional departments or units in enterprises in this framework. This research results provide a perspective for human management experience to enhance the capabilities of AI Agents and provide direction for future research.},

  abstract={This study was made possible by the University of La Laguna. The Educational Technology courses within the Bachelor’s degrees in Early Childhood Education and in Physical Activity and Sports Sciences (n = 103) were redesigned, integrating AI agents such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Perplexity into six phases for the critical use of these tools—questioning, comparison, critical dialogue, verification, re-elaboration and reflection—which guided students’ reflective interaction with AI. After the intervention, a mixed 23-item questionnaire was administered; descriptive statistics and thematic analysis of the “Evaluation and use of AI” dimension revealed that 88% of students believe AI should be didactically promoted in higher education and 42% identified ChatGPT as the agent providing the best answers. The most developed competencies were comparing outputs from different AI systems (66%), designing effective prompts (63%) and critically analysing responses (52%). The main potentialities highlighted were rapid access to information and time saving, while perceived risks centred on plagiarism and cognitive dependence. The findings corroborate the pedagogical validity of the model for strengthening prompt-engineering skills and critical thinking, yet underscore the need to deepen ethical training and rigorous verification frameworks to address concerns about academic integrity and AI reliability. It is concluded that a reflective and regulated integration of these technologies can significantly enhance teacher education in higher education.},

  abstract={This research explores the transformative role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAl) for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) software developers. KSA is transforming from an oil-dependent economy to a diversified one to achieve Vision 2030. Technological advancement is among the strategic objectives of the Kingdom, facilitating the achievement of the ambitious vision. GenAl's ability to undertake tasks like code generation, debugging, and documentation may threaten developers whose jobs could be replaced. However, instead of replacing software engineers, GenAl will create more opportunities for programmers, increase the demand for more experienced developers, and evolve the role of software engineers. While the benefits of GenAl in software engineering are immense, the Kingdom should address the ethical challenges, inadequate transparency, accountability problems, and data privacy issues. This paper recommends the establishment of a National AI Ethics Board, the government to mandate explainable AI (XAI), investments in more localised models like the Arabic Large Language Model (ALLaM), extensive training for GenAl engineers, cross-sector collaboration, and continuous monitoring.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The pervasive spread of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has borne increasing security risk, with static defense falling to dynamic, smart attacks. The Hybrid Adaptive AI Security Framework (HAASF), a novel framework that combines reinforcement learning (RL), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and swarm intelligence (SI) to provide strong, adaptive security for IoT ecosystems, is what this paper offers. HAASF employs a DQN-based RL defender to acquire dynamic defense prioritization, GANs for strong proactive learning through realistic attack model generation, and PSO-induced SI for IoT node distributed threat mitigation. Evaluated on an NS-3 simulated testbed smart home with 50 devices of diverse hardware, HAASF was compared with five types of attacks, i.e., DDoS, Man-in-the-Middle, Sybil, Data Tampering, and Replay attacks. Against baselines—single RL, signature-based IDS, and CNN-based anomaly detection—HAASF achieved a 95% detection rate, 4% false positive rate, 1.9-second response time, and 40 mW energy consumption. These are HAASF's capabilities in new threat detection, predicting attack patterns, and resource optimization combined against traditional IoT defenses. Through the combination of hybrid AI approaches, HAASF offers scalable, energy-efficient, and responsive security upon which scalable IoT systems can be based in increasingly interconnected and vulnerable systems.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the interaction of non-expert stakeholders with Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the energy urban domain, using the VIRTSI model and focusing on the capabilities of ChatGPT. VIRTSI (Variability and Impact of Reciprocal Trust States towards Intelligent systems), is a rigorous computational model for human-AI Interaction that simulates human trust states, spanning from overtrust to distrust, through user modelling and quantifies the efficiency of the interaction in VIRTSI-adapted confusion matrices. The research employed an 16-question survey, evaluating the accuracy and usefulness of ChatGPT's responses regarding energy consumption, cost-effective solutions, and renewable energy production for residential buildings in Greece. Each answer was assessed by human stakeholders who were non-expert in the energy Urban Domain (e.g house owners, building managers, etc.), who either accepted or rejected the responses based on validation processes. The analysis highlighted key aspects such as repetition, specification, and objections in the interaction with ChatGPT, offering insights into the effectiveness of AI in supporting energy-related decisions. The findings reveal that while AI can provide valuable information, user validation and expert consultation are critical for practical implementation. This highlights both the potential and limitations of integrating AI tools like ChatGPT in enhancing non-expert stakeholder engagement and decision-making in urban energy management, emphasizing the ongoing need for human expert involvement.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) image generation techniques have proved to be potential techniques in the development of the digital creative product design. However, integrating digital culture with modernity while classifying AI image generation technology was a major concern. In this research, the hyper parameter tuned Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Stochastic Gradient (DCNN-SGD) is proposed to overcome these drawbacks, by classifying $A I$ images of product design. The open source AI images are collected and pre-processed to achieve noise free images by applying Gaussian filter. The pre-processed images are then fed to the CNN to extract features. The creative product design process is analysed which includes research and analysis, design expression and the final evaluation. The DCNN with convolutional, pooling and fully connected layers are used for the classification and identification of cultural symbols. For the effective identification of cultural heritage, the hyperparameters of the DCNN are finetuned with SGD. The experimental results showed that the proposed DCNN-SGD achieved better performance with classification accuracy of $\mathbf{9 8. 6 7 \%}$, precision of $\mathbf{9 5. 7 7 \%}$, and recall of $94.26 \%$ when compared to the existing methods improved Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).},

The algorithm can use most of the unlabeled samples and a small part of the labeled samples to realize the abnormal detection of uncivilized speech, which solves the problems that the experimental samples are not easy to obtain and the cost of marking is high. In order to make full use of the latent representation learned by the encoder module in the auto-encoder, a new representation term is added to the anomaly score function part; in order to improve the problem of the traditional convolution local receptive field, a self-attention mechanism is introduced into the generative adversarial network Modules that help models learn long-range dependency representations of data. Experiments on self-made datasets show that the method proposed in this paper can improve the ability of model anomaly detection and improve the accuracy of anomaly detection.},

A comparison is made between experimental groups that follow AI-integrated teaching methods and control groups that follow a traditional approach to instruction. As part of the study, scores of pre- and post-assessment questions were collected, learning progression patterns were analyzed, and instructors and students provided qualitative feedback. As a result of the experimental data, it has been possible to discern which AI tools have strengths and limitations within the context of higher education. A variety of adaptive learning platforms are evaluated for their ability to adjust content to individual learning styles, while intelligent tutoring systems are assessed for their impact on comprehension, retention, and problem-solving skills. Automated grading tools are tested for their efficiency gains in assessment processes and their ability to improve feedback promptness and quality. A substantial amount of empirical evidence is provided by the findings of this study to the ongoing discourse on AI integration in higher education. This study provides a wealth of actionable insights for academic staff, technicians, and administrators seeking evidence-based strategies for implementing AI technologies in their educational frameworks.},

  abstract={Promoting student engagement in CSCL has been an important issue for educators. Previous studies have attempted to design retrieval-based conversational agents to assist students in completing collaborative tasks. However, few studies have explored how to integrate generative artificial intelligence with scaffolds to promote student engagement. Addressing the gap, this study developed a collaborative platform that integrates scaffolds with generative AI-based conversational agent. Additionally, a quasi-experiment involving 42 undergraduate students was conducted to examine the impact of this intervention on student engagement, including behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement. The results demonstrated that while the intervention did not significantly improve overall student engagement, it led to a notable increase in cognitive engagement. These findings suggest that generative AI-based agents, when combined with scaffolds, have the potential to target and enhance specific dimensions of engagement in CSCL environments.},

  abstract={Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems digitize all business processes within companies in order to enhance automation and optimize efficiency. These solutions integrate data and processes across multiple functions such as sales, marketing, finance, supply chain, manufacturing, services, procurement, and human resources, serving as a central repository of information for numerous organizations. ERP systems typically encompass tens of thousands of business processes and manage data across thousands of tables, creating significant opportunities for the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) for increasing process automatization and optimization. Nonetheless, embedding Generative AI into ERP solutions is a complex task due to the intricate nature of these systems, which consist of hundreds of millions of lines of code and cater to a wide array of industry-specific and regional requirements. Consequently, the key research question addressed in this paper is: How to systematically develop and operate Generative AI business applications in ERP systems? This article aims to answer this question by conducting a use case analysis, deriving business requirements, designing and implementing a solution framework, and evaluating its effectiveness through real-world ERP use cases.},

In this paper, we examine the interaction between developers of GAI models and design students, focusing on the nexus between ethics and functionality. Using a design class example, we show how GAI models can help students efficiently and responsibly explore design alternatives by quantitatively assessing their designs' novelty relative to the training data. Through the presented framework, it becomes apparent that the ethical use of GAI models will also require developers to implement specific network architectures. However, the joint interaction will greatly promote transparency in the creative process, support fair monetization of a student's intellectual property, and facilitate the development of high-quality training datasets for future GAI models. By addressing these considerations, we aim to promote the responsible use of GAI in design education and beyond.},

  abstract={This paper analyzes gaps in key safety issues for U.S. Food and Drug Administration and international approvals of artificial intelligence/machine learning-enabled medical devices (AIMD).

For example, NIST Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-82r3, and NIST SP 1500-202, Section 2.3.3, suggest approximate patient safety analysis approaches. Related NIST security issues are identified in NIST guidance for artificial intelligence/machine learning risk management, such as NIST's adversarial machine learning guidance. An analytical literature review was conducted within the Johns Hopkins University Sheridan Libraries Catalyst databases to support stated objectives around selected NIST common language terms related to safety and security. The resulting analysis demonstrates that, in the U.S. and on an international scale, selected AIMD literature and guidance may not include or consistently use critical, integrated terms for AIMD security or safety, such as NISTIR 8312's four principles of artificial intelligence explainability. In conclusion, AIMD safety and security could be addressed with NIST common languages.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of Generative AI technology, especially the rise of large-scale language models and diffusion models, the field of semantic communication is facing new opportunities and challenges. Traditional semantic communication systems have some limitations in conveying semantic information in a dynamic environment, but generative artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to break through this bottleneck with its ability of context understanding and data generation. This paper proposes GenAI-SC, a generative semantic communication architecture that utilizes large-scale pre-training models for semantic information extraction and adopts a diffusion model as its core. The architecture extracts and compresses semantic information through large-scale models and utilizes diffusion models to achieve high-quality image recovery, which is especially suitable for complex communication environments. To verify the effectiveness of this architecture, this paper design two task modes, plain text diffusion image generation and text-image joint diffusion generation, to flexibly cope with different transmission tasks. The experimental results show that GenAI-SC performs well under different channel conditions and inference steps, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio environment, showing that GenAI-SC has good multitasking capability and communication robustness. This paper provides an innovative path for the design and implementation of semantic communication system.},

  abstract={Generative models are an important class of models in the field of artificial intelligence. Unlike models that aim to establish a mapping between inputs and outputs by extracting features, the goal of generative models is to learn the distribution of training data and generate new samples with similar features from a latent space. In the development of generative models, efforts have been made to improve the diversity of generated samples, progressing from VAE (variational auto-encoders). VAE achieves random sampling and generation of diverse images by transforming the bottleneck layer of the encoder from predicting low-dimensional feature maps to predicting positions sampled from a normal distribution. Subsequently, vector quantized variational autoencoders(VQ-VAE) and VQ-VAE-2 models were introduced, followed by the first-generation DALL-E model, and then diffusion models. We will discuss the basic principles of each model, the strengths and weaknesses of the models, and the innovations introduced by each model compared to its predecessors. After that, an overview of the evaluation metrics specific to generation models is provided. Finally, the applications that generation model enables are summarized. This review provides creative ideas for the future development of generative models.},

  abstract={Night vision technology provides an important means for night observation by using infrared radiation of the target as the imaging basis. Recently, artificial neural network (ANN) has become a research hotspot. Realizing the classification and recognition of infrared images by ANN is helpful to the intelligent development of night vision technology, as well as improve the accurate judgment of the surrounding environment by unmanned vehicles at night, and better ensure the safety of people and vehicles. However, the existing infrared image data set contains a small number of images, and the types of scenes and targets presented in the images are single, which cannot support the training of ANN. ANN cannot obtain the classification function of infrared images through full learning. In this paper, an infrared image generative model based on generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed, which can convert the existing visible light data set into the infrared version of the data set in a short time, and then solve the problem of lack of infrared image data sets. To train ResNet by infrared version data set can realize its classification function for infrared images. The model with the existing image generative model is compared through several evaluation indexes. The results show that the model is more effective in generative infrared images. Inputting ImageNet data set into this model can generate ImageNet infrared version data set. ResNet trained by this data set has a classification and recognition accuracy of 91.28%, which is higher than the experimental results of existing image generative models. The design and implementation of infrared image generative model in this paper promote the application of artificial intelligence and depth learning in night vision technology and other fields.},

  abstract={The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, particularly large language models (LLMs), into higher education presents both opportunities for pedagogical innovation and challenges to academic integrity. While recent initiatives, such as the European Union's AI Act and UNESCO's Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, have provided frameworks for ethical AI adoption, their practical implementation at the institutional level remains uneven. This study investigates how university faculty perceive the ethical implications of AI use in academic environments. Conducted as part of the EmpowerAI Erasmus+ project, a structured focus group involving 21 lecturers from the Technical University of Sofia in Bulgaria explored faculty staff attitudes toward AI's role in areas such as critical thinking, authorship, fairness, access, and privacy. Through thematic analysis, the study identifies emerging tensions between innovation and responsibility, and between equitable access and academic rigor. The findings underscore the need for context-sensitive institutional policies and educator training on AI ethics. The paper aims to contribute empirical evidence to the growing body of literature on responsible AI integration in higher education and informs the co-creation of actionable ethical guidelines that reflect both regulatory expectations and academic values.},

  abstract={The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Generative AI, is poised to bring significant changes to various aspects of the human world. While there is ongoing debate about the use of AI for writing manuscripts, completing assignments, and other working tasks, this research takes a step back to address a fundamental question: How accurate and efficient is AI in helping to conduct research? This research focuses on the initial step of research - literature search and screening. As the volume of academic literature grows exponentially, efficient and effective methods for synthesizing existing knowledge become crucial for scientific discovery. This research aims to explore the potential of AI-driven solutions in the literature screening process and compare them with traditional labor- and time-intensive approaches. Adopting a comparative analysis approach, this research examines both traditional manual screening techniques and AI-powered approaches and evaluates AI’ s performances. Data were collected from a comprehensive review of existing literature on the multidisciplinary topic of the digital divide. The analysis focuses on the accuracy, efficiency, and usefulness of AI in processing large volumes of literature. Results suggested that AI-driven approaches can reduce substantial manual work and time investment while maintaining certain levels of accuracy in identifying relevant studies. However, the challenge of algorithmic bias remains, and this calls for human intervention. Instead of AI replacing humans, our findings suggest a hybrid approach - combining AI capabilities with human expertise. Such an approach offers the most promising solutions for future literature review and screening processes, evidencing the synergy between AI and humans.},

  abstract={This article unveils CodeBlizz, an innovative AI-powered add-on for IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) like Visual Studio Code. This software program makes use of generative AI to provide developers with seamless access to educational assets along with support for real-time debugging, and context-aware code suggestions. Compared to various code completion tools on the market, CodeBlizz takes a complete strategy to dramatically lower the learning curve for inexperienced workers while simultaneously increasing coding productivity. This is achieved through the direct integration of learning resources into the working environment. CodeBlizz utilizes proficient transformer-based models, such as CodeBERT for comprehending syntax and producing useful snippets and GPT-3 to generate context-aware code referrals. Also, the plugin employs T5 models to provide real-time problem detection and debugging support by turning malfunctioning code into error messages and possible fixes. Added to that, adaptive learning from user feedback is feasible with reinforcement learning models such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which boosts the accuracy of the model over time. Together, these machine learning elements allow CodeBlizz to provide developers with solid and dynamic support from within the IDE, which helps to boost accuracy and speed up code completion. Without pushing users to leave the IDE, the plugin renders functionalities encompassing dynamically generated code snippets, syntax correction, error pattern identification, and real-time tutorials for learning at ease. On the survey, users reported a thirty percent reduction in time spent on error correction and tutorial seeks from online websites, which further validates the benefit of incorporating AI that generates code for immediate guidance within the coding routine. Early testing demonstrates a significant boost in coding accuracy.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming our world, and education is no exception. The growing popularity and use of AI systems calls for a new understanding of what it means to be literate in the modern world. Thus, it is crucial for individuals to develop AI-driven critical thinking skills to effectively interact with these technologies. However, existing research focuses mainly on the "how" of AI integration, with limited exploration of the "why" and "how" of fostering critical engagement with AI tools. In this article, we propose an extension to DigCompEdu that aligns with the UNESCO pillars of education. This extension highlights five key elements that challenge critical thinking capabilities in relation to AI: "know-what," "know-who," "know-where," "know-how," and "know-why". By combining critical thinking skills with AI functionalities, educators can empower students to become responsible and informed digital citizens in the era of generative AI.},
