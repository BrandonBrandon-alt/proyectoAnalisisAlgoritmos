  abstract={This study investigates the transformative impact of predictive and generative artificial intelligence (AI) on the education workforce in developing countries, focusing on its challenges, opportunities, and implications. Utilizing a qualitative case study approach, we explored the AI's impacts, challenges, and opportunities on work within the education sector in ten educational institutions across three countries, through qualitative data collection methods, including semi-structured interviews, observations, informal discussions, and focus group discussions with students, lecturers, and administrative staff. The findings highlight the role of AI in revolutionizing pedagogy, enhancing student engagement, and optimizing administrative workflows. Educators reported improvements in teaching strategies driven by AI-powered adaptive learning platforms and AI-generated resources, which enable personalized and dynamic learning experiences. However, the research also revealed key challenges, such as resistance to AI adoption, concerns over data privacy, and infrastructure limitations that hinder effective integration. A cross-case analysis emphasized the evolving role of educators, highlighting shifts in teacher-student dynamics and potential increases in job satisfaction, tempered by new responsibilities. While students benefit from personalized learning paths, they also face hurdles related to digital literacy and unequal access to AI-driven resources. Ethical considerations around AI deployment emerged as critical, underscoring the need for clear guidelines and strong policies. The study concludes by offering recommendations for educational institutions, policymakers, and AI developers to collaborate in fostering an innovative, inclusive, and ethically responsible educational landscape. Future research is encouraged to expand on these findings across different educational contexts and explore the long-term effects of AI on teaching, learning, and workforce dynamics.},

  title={Design of an Improved Model for Music Sequence Generation Using Conditional Variational Autoencoder and Conditional GAN}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-4},
  abstract={Whilst the task of creating music sequences through artificial intelligence has been met with a lot of attention, current approaches tend to stumble when it comes to capturing rich structures and subtle detail in musical compositions. Conventional models lack the capacity to build temporal dependencies as well as incorporate condition mechanisms (such as genre or mood), counteracting in less-ideal generation quality. In this work we address the above limitations and propose a hybrid model incorporating Dynamic Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) [15] and Generative Adversarial Network for music sequence generation from MIDI files. Our proposed approach utilizes a piano-roll representation and an event-based encoding for pre-processing, retaining structural as well as temporal complexities of music samples at the level of events. Meanwhile, the CVAE part (in a Seq2Seq architecture) is introduced to model conditioned latent distribution over music sequence attributes such as genre or composer identity in order contribute both generation and reconstruction of realistic musical samples. Furthermore, a Conditional GAN (cGAN) along with Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) is utilized for generating sequences of better quality by creating more realistic and conditionally plausible music samples. The results we show demonstrate that this hybrid CVAE-GAN framework can not only significantly improve the quality of generated music sequences (in terms like FAD) but also allow for a better listening experience, outperforming state-of-the-art evaluation methods. The work sets up a potential future in which AI helps musicians compose more nuanced music that is almost indistinguishable from the product of human creativity.},

  abstract={Generating fine-grained, realistic images from text has many applications in the visual and semantic realm. Considering that, we propose Bangla Attentional Generative Adversarial Network (AttnGAN) that allows intensified, multi-stage processing for high-resolution Bangla text-to-image generation. Our model can integrate the most specific details at different sub-regions of the image. We distinctively concentrate on the relevant words in the natural language description. This framework has achieved a better inception score of $3.58\pm .06$ on the CUB dataset. For the first time, a fine-grained image is generated from Bangla text using attentional GAN. Bangla has achieved 7th position among 100 most spoken languages. This inspires us to explicitly focus on this language, which will ensure the inevitable need of many people. Moreover, Bangla has a more complex syntactic structure and less natural language processing resource that validates our work more.},

  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={In recent years, evolutionary computation has signif-icantly advanced in processes related to machine learning. How-ever, the reciprocal integration of machine learning techniques into evolutionary computation remains relatively unexplored. Machine learning can substantially enhance the understanding of processes within Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) by harnessing its proficiency in identifying patterns and employing data-driven approaches. Existing studies lack a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interaction between machine learning models and evolutionary algorithms, necessi-tating prioritized investigation to ensure the efficacy, reliabil-ity, and compatibility of integrated models within optimization frameworks. This paper addresses this gap by examining the behavior of using Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models as a population variation operator in Multi-objective Optimization Problems. Our experimental results reveal that Generative AI, particularly Distributional Adversarial Networks (DANs), sur-passes the performance of a traditional Generative Adversarial Network. Furthermore, DANs improve the population by gen-erating novel non-dominated solutions and augmenting overall performance and diversity. This study reveals the potential of the integration of Generative AI in evolutionary computation, presenting a pathway for advancements in addressing common challenges within multi-objective optimization problems.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way programming is taught and learnt and is redefining t he way programming skills are assessed in the continuously changing field of computer science education. This paper introduces a novel approach for teaching and evaluating programming knowledge by reversing Bloom's taxonomy in order to accommodate AI-powered learning. Traditionally, Bloom's taxonomy progresses from basic cognitive skills like remembering and understanding to advanced skills like creating. With AI tools such as WebSim.ai and Anthropic Artifacts now capable of generating sophisticated outputs, the focus shifts away from students' ability to create, as these tools handle that task effectively. Instead, this paper proposes placing a higher emphasis on students' ability to understand and critically analyze AI -generated solutions, assessing their comprehension and ability to reverse-engineer existing work. We call this the Reverse Bloom Taxonomy, where students begin with creation and then move toward deeper understanding of the subject matter. This paper outlines the methodology for applying this reversed framework in programming education and presents a promising concept for improving student learning outcomes. The discussion addresses challenges in implementation and emphasizes the strategic integration of AI -driven learning to prepare students for a technology-driven workforce.},

  abstract={Counterfactuals can explain classification decisions of neural networks in a human interpretable way. We propose a simple but effective method to generate such counterfactuals. More specifically, we perform a suitable diffeomorphic coordinate transformation and then perform gradient ascent in these coordinates to find counterfactuals which are classified with great confidence as a specified target class. We propose two methods to leverage generative models to construct such suitable coordinate systems that are either exactly or approximately diffeomorphic. We analyze the generation process theoretically using Riemannian differential geometry and validate the quality of the generated counterfactuals using various qualitative and quantitative measures.},

  title={A Realistic Image Generation of Face From Text Description Using the Fully Trained Generative Adversarial Networks},

  pages={1250-1260},
  abstract={Text to face generation is a sub-domain of text to image synthesis. It has a huge impact on new research areas along with the wide range of applications in the public safety domain. Due to the lack of dataset, the research work focused on the text to face generation is very limited. Most of the work for text to face generation until now is based on the partially trained generative adversarial networks, in which the pre-trained text encoder has been used to extract the semantic features of the input sentence. Later, these semantic features have been utilized to train the image decoder. In this research work, we propose a fully trained generative adversarial network to generate realistic and natural images. The proposed work trained the text encoder as well as the image decoder at the same time to generate more accurate and efficient results. In addition to the proposed methodology, another contribution is to generate the dataset by the amalgamation of LFW, CelebA and locally prepared dataset. The dataset has also been labeled according to our defined classes. Through performing different kinds of experiments, it has been proved that our proposed fully trained GAN outperformed by generating good quality images by the input sentence. Moreover, the visual results have also strengthened our experiments by generating the face images according to the given query.},

  year={2025},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={The emerging 6G-IoT paradigm is driving communication toward intelligent services, semantic communication enables efficient semantic sharing via artificial intelligence (AI), significantly boosting communication efficiency. However, current semantic systems suffer from black-box decision-making, while existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods face two key challenges: explicability granularity mismatch and closed-loop optimization gap. To address these, we propose a semantic communication framework integrated with XAI (XAI-SCS). Specifically, we first design an explainable semantic codec architecture enhanced by Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KAN), where traditional fixed activation functions are replaced with learnable and parameterized ones, enabling function-level visualization to improve model explainability. Second, we develop an explainable semantic transmission module driven by contrastive learning that enhances the robustness of semantic transmission, and incorporating a semantic separability metric to quantify channel impacts on semantic integrity. Third, we introduced a KAN-enhanced causal semantic decoder, which integrates counterfactual interventions to generate pixel-level difference maps. We also propose a contrastive explanation consistency metric to evaluate the sensitivity of key features, enhancing the quality of the reconstruction. The experimental results show that our approaches enhance explainability across the entire decision process, achieve a significant accuracy improvement of up to 55% on the CIFAR-10 dataset with a bandwidth compression ratio of 1/25, and also obtain competitive image reconstruction quality in increasing compression levels.

  abstract={The objective of video anomaly detection is to distinguish events within videos that deviate from expected normal behavior. An effective anomaly detection model requires strong spatio-temporal feature extraction capabilities to capture both appearance and motion information from the video. We utilize a generative adversarial networks model to perform anomaly detection by predicting future frame. The model is trained with multi-objective loss function for appearance and motion constraints. We introduce multi-objective optimization algorithm to guarantee the convergence of training objectives, including intensity loss, gradient loss for appearance constraints, optical flow loss for motion constraints and adversarial loss for adversarial training. By ensuring corresponding generative outcome for both normal events to confirm to expectation and anomaly events not to do so, we obtain an anomaly detection model with satisfying experimental result on video anomaly detection datasets, showing the success of the proposed training strategy.},

  pages={57-70},
  abstract={In the wave of technological innovation, generative artificial intelligence tools provide college students with personalized learning experience, promote autonomous learning and exploratory learning, and improve learning outcomes through intelligent tutoring and instant feedback. However, existing research shows that generative artificial intelligence tools still face multiple obstacles in practical application, such as differences in students' acceptance of new technologies, privacy protection challenges, and difficulties in integrating with the existing education system. This study is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a technology acceptance model, and specifically introduces perceived risk as a moderating variable. Combining key factors such as college students' cognitive characteristics and technological environment, this study constructs a theoretical model that affects college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools.The study found that performance expectations, effort expectations, social influence, and convenience conditions have a significant positive impact on college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools; effort expectations have a positive impact on performance expectations; convenience conditions have a positive impact on effort expectations; effort expectations mediate the relationship between convenience conditions and willingness to use; and perceived risk negatively moderates the impact of convenience conditions on willingness to use. It is expected that through this empirical study, the key factors that affect college students' willingness to use generative artificial intelligence tools will be deeply explored, and valuable suggestions and references will be provided for guiding technology optimization and education integration practices, which will help develop generative artificial intelligence tools that better meet the needs of college students and promote innovation and improvement of online education models.},

  abstract={Before CNN, image recognition methods mainly relied on artificial design features, which can only represent the medium and low-level information in the image, and it is difficult to extract the deep-level information of the image. CNN simulates the human brain by establishing a deep neural network to analyze, learn and interpret data. It has strong expression ability and generalization ability, and can better represent the deep-seated information of images. At present, CNN has been widely used in many scenes, including image classification, speech recognition, video analysis, document analysis and so on. Most of the existing artificial intelligence image recognition systems are implemented by software and often accelerated by GPU. However, GPU has high power consumption and is not suitable for CNN reasoning, so it can not make use of the parallel computing power of CNN. To solve the above problems, this paper studies the application method of CNN image recognition acceleration and Optimization Based on FPGA, designs and optimizes the CNN forward model by using Intel FPGA board. The experimental results show that FPGA has low power consumption, the power consumption of CPU is 2.1 times, while the power consumption of GPU is 6.5 times. The average recognition time of the algorithm is 50% shorter than that of Lenet-5,AlexNet and VGG16, and the recognition time of 10000 sample pictures is 165μs. Compared with 426.6μs required by DSP chip system. Compared with the methods proposed in the literature in related fields in recent years, the proposed method has higher throughput and computational performance.},

  abstract={Educators have raised concerns about the utilization of ChatGPT in generating unoriginal text and the possibility of plagiarism. To address these concerns, various AI text detection software tools have been developed to evaluate whether a text is AI generated or human generated. The aim of this research is to empirically examine the accuracy of AI detection tools in identifying AI-generated texts. An experiment was conducted using textual data generated by ChatGPT, which was assessed using Turnitin and four other AI detection tools. Through multiple iterations and interventions, the text was paraphrased by ChatGPT until it appeared original and could not be detected as AI-generated by Turnitin’s AI detection tool. The findings revealed that all the AI detection software tools that were examined failed to detect the AI-generated text by ChatGPT in the final iteration. The findings provide valuable insights that have implications for various stakeholders, including educators, researchers, and AI text detection software developers. Based on the tools examined, educators and researchers do not need to set a specific threshold or percentage, including 0%, to determine what qualifies as acceptable AI-generated text. This is because establishing such a threshold can be misleading, considering the current limitations in the algorithms of these tools. Furthermore, the data generated in this paper can provide a solid basis for replicated research or software testing and assessment. It can be utilized to evaluate the accuracy of alternative AI detection tools and any future advancements in the tools mentioned in this investigation.},

  abstract={Recent studies have indicated that the private client images in federated learning can be restored through the shared global model by gradient based inversion attacks. These attacks often employ gradient matching strategy to align the gradients of the reconstructed dummy data with the real data, thereby bringing the dummy images look similar to the actual private images. However, due to the inherent characteristic of high dimensional search space, directly optimizing the dummy images is easy to cause reconstruction failure. In addition, the quality of restored images is significantly sensitive to the data initialization method. Therefore, in this paper, we would like to introduce a novel generative gradient inversion, named GGI, attack algorithm where the dummy images are generated on low-dimensional latent vectors through a pre-trained generator. Compared to the common entire data reconstruction, optimizing the random vectors dramatically reduce the dimension of search space. Our empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively enhance the quality of restored images.},

  abstract={This research-to-practice full paper aims to analyze the public's comments on generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in computer science (CS) education, by the BERT-based model and Large Language Model (LLM) approaches to sentiment analysis and contextualize the results within broader educational and technological landscapes. Artificial intelligence (AI) has played a crucial role in advancing technical development throughout many areas. Evidence points toward the likelihood of major developmental breakthroughs unfolding soon in those sectors. Education is one such area. While there is certainly a possibility for hype and unfulfilled promises, the advent of available GAI platforms, such as ChatGPT, has caused a surge of scholarly interest in the impact of these technologies on CS education. Amid the growing debate, both the potential benefits and concerns of GAI in this sector are increasingly coming to the fore as people grapple with the tradeoffs associated with these technologies when applied in education settings. One can imagine the range of conversations around the topic, but that is difficult to use as input for policymakers and administrators without a more concrete understanding. To wit, there remain open questions about which benefits and concerns people tend to focus on when discussing GAI in education. This large-scale qualitative study addresses that gap by exploring the public's perspectives on GAI in CS education. We engage in this work by collecting and analyzing data from social media platforms, specifically Reddit comments. The social media dataset was analyzed using machine learning (ML) techniques to identify topics based on sentiment analysis. The study's objective was to document and characterize the public's perspectives concerning the general characteristics of GAI, its features related to learning, and its usability in educational settings. Through sentiment analysis using Large Language Models (LLM), the study revealed an overall positive public perception toward using generative AI in CS education, with over 57% of comments being favorable, while also identifying prominent topics of interest and concerns, such as the potential benefits of personalized learning support and automated grading, as well as issues like academic dishonesty, perpetuation of biases, over-reliance on AI hindering critical thinking, displacement of human instructors, and the need for updated curricula. The insights gleaned from the analysis will be instrumental in computing educators gaining a more profound comprehension of GAI 'srole in education and the subsequent development of GAI -enriched curricula.},

  abstract={The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in cyberattacks poses critical challenges to organizational cybersecurity as traditional defense mechanisms become increasingly obsolete. Despite this growing threat, there is limited systematic understanding of how organizations can effectively respond. This study conducts a systematic literature review to analyse organizational defense strategies against AI-driven cyber threats. We examined 26 peer-reviewed articles published between 2019 and 2024, selected from key databases, including Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, and Google Scholar, using PRISMA methodology. We identified three primary defense mechanisms through thematic analysis: AI-enhanced threat detection systems, adaptive security frameworks, and human-AI collaborative approaches. Our findings indicate that organizations implementing AI-based defense systems showed a 40% improvement in threat detection rates. However, 73% of organizations needed help maintaining up-to-date AI models against evolving threats. The review reveals a critical need for dynamic defense architectures that combine real-time AI adaptation with robust human oversight. These findings contribute to theory and practice by providing a comprehensive framework for organizational resilience against AI-driven cyber threats. Future research should address the identified gaps in real-time threat response systems and explore the ethical implications of AI-driven cybersecurity measures.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), IoT devices find applications in various domains. The data generated by these devices is utilized for analysis and services, especially in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to IoT, known as AI of Things (AIoT). The enhancement of edge device computing power in the IoT has led to the emergence of research areas like edge–cloud synergy AI theories and application services. In the context of lifelong learning and real-time processes in AIoT edge–cloud synergy services, addressing unseen tasks becomes crucial. Unseen tasks arise when inference requests from edge devices involve models not present in the cloud’s model repository. Addressing these challenges involves generating data to either augment small sample problems or alter the data distribution for heterogeneous sample issues. As the application of large language models (LLMs) for data generation gains traction, challenges emerge in the context of AIoT edge–cloud synergy services. First, fine-tuning LLMs with heterogeneous data exacerbates model bias issues. Second, the substantial data requirements for training LLMs pose a contradiction. Finally, the involvement of manual annotation in LLM-based data generation introduces complexity and cost. This article proposes a framework Seafarer to these challenges using generative adversarial networks and self-taught learning. Seafarer avoids model bias, reduces data requirements, and eliminates the need for manual annotation. The design demonstrates effectiveness theoretically and is validated on the Cityscapes data set, achieving an 80% reduction in training loss and improved validation loss stability.},

  abstract={Despite AI transforming algorithmic trading, the lack of transparency in these systems, sometimes referred to as “black boxes,” hinders wider confidence and acceptance. This proposed research presents a novel approach to uncovering the decision-making process of AI-driven trading strategies. It utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce visual explanations that are easy to understand. This methodology surpasses conventional methods of explain ability by transforming the intricate, data-derived understandings of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement-learning agent into easily understandable visual representations. More precisely, we utilize saliency maps to emphasize the crucial market elements that affect the agent's actions, offering an unparalleled level of understanding of its operational reasoning. Our assessment highlights the effectiveness of these visualizations in improving human comprehension, thus closing the gap between advanced AI capabilities and practical financial experience. This work not only promotes increased clarity and trust in algorithmic trading but also establishes a standard for using visual explanations in intricate AI systems. This has ramifications for adhering to regulations, creating algorithms, and involving stakeholders in the financial sector.},

  abstract={Based on emerging artificial intelligence (AI) tasks, cloud-edge–terminal architecture can provide powerful computing, intelligent interconnection, and real-time response, which can also be regarded as AI-driven network. Unfortunately, multiple network layers in the AI-driven network usually face various types of network threats, such as malicious network reconnaissance, side-channel attacks, and distributed denial of service (DDoS). Traditional security solutions respond to network threats after the occurrence of attacks. To solve this problem, the concept of moving target defense (MTD) has been proposed as a proactive defense mechanism that aims to defend against cyber attacks before they occur. In this article, we first provide a thorough analysis of the threats in the cloud-edge–terminal network. Then, we conduct a comprehensive survey to discuss the concept, design principles, and main classifications of MTD. Next, we further introduce the development potential in terms of AI-powered MTD on each network layer. Meanwhile, we also explore how MTD improves the security of AI algorithms. Lastly, we describe the existing challenges and research directions of MTD. The aim of this article is to provide an in-depth understanding for the readers on how to realize the integration between MTD and AI-driven network.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) stands at the forefront of the banking sector's technological revolution, promising enhancements in decision-making, risk management, and customer interaction. This paper examines Gen AI's potential to inject innovation and efficiency into banking services, with an estimated value addition of up to $340 billion annually. Grounded in advancements in NLP through Transformer architecture and evolving GPT models, Gen AI's applications in the banking industry are extensive. They range from personalizing customer service with AI-driven chatbots to revolutionizing credit scoring and trading strategies. However, alongside these opportunities, the paper addresses the significant challenges of regulatory compliance, ethical data usage, and the technical integration of AI systems. With the impending release of the EU's AI Act and existing GDPR and DORA, financial institutions must strategize to align with new standards while harnessing Gen AI's capabilities for process optimization and enhanced service delivery. The role of international standards such as ISO/IEC 42001:2023, ISO 31000:2018, ISO/IEC 23894:2023, NIST AI 600-1 and ISO/IEC 23053:2022 is considered to be beneficial in establishing a common framework for managing AI systems, ensuring data integrity and promoting transparency. By adopting these standards, banks can facilitate compliance across various jurisdictions, enhancing operational consistency and reliability – but certain significant limitations in addressing specific regulatory requirements must be taken into account. The paper concludes that Gen AI's future in banking will be transformative, driven by the industry's need to balance technological innovation with ethical and regulatory requirements and process standardization, which will lead to more transparent, personalized and efficient banking services.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence tools are getting increasingly incorporated into journalism workflows globally. Despite growing concerns among journalists about the privacy risks of AI tools, there is limited scholarly research on how journalists understand AI-related privacy, security, and data protection, particularly in Africa. To address this gap, this study investigates journalists' mental models around privacy policies and data handling by Artificial Intelligence companies responsible for the tools they use. We conducted a qualitative study which interviewed 20 journalists working in Nigeria about their use of GenAI tools in fulfilling their duties, ranging from information verification to reporting. The data collected was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis to draw patterns in the journalists' assumptions about GenAI privacy and the security of their data when interacting with these AI tools. Nigeria was chosen as our case study due to its significance as Africa's largest democracy, and as a country whose AI policy acknowledges and seeks to promote data privacy and security. Our interviews found that journalists have a less-than-ideal mental model of privacy policies and data handling practices by AI companies, leading to potential risk in AI-assisted journalism. We also noted a willingness to share data with AI companies in exchange for some form of value, including better technology, and journalism-specific agentic AI. We conclude that the journalists are willing to do the right thing but lack the time, resources and guidance to do so.},

  abstract={Deep fakes are becoming increasingly realistic because to the quick development of artificial intelligence, especially with the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This presents serious threats to security and privacy. Since deepfakes can be used maliciously to distort photos, movies, and sounds, it is imperative that they are detected as soon as possible. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning model that combines the advantages of Residual Neural Networks (RESNET) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Channel-Wise Attention Mechanisms is presented as a comprehensive method for deepfake detection. The suggested model seeks to precisely detect regions of the face that have been altered and classify faces as authentic or modified. To focus on important facial traits, the model combines the generative capacity of GANs with the discriminative skills of RESNET, which are enhanced by Channel Wise Attention Mechanisms. DFDC, FaceForensic++, CelebDF, and other benchmark datasets are used to assess the performance of this hybrid model. With a precision of 0.79, recall of 0.88, F1-score of 0.83, accuracy of 0.83, and ROC AUC Score of 0.825, it has high performance characteristics. Furthermore, the model undergoes testing against hostile attacks and proves its resilience in actual situations. In addition to accurate deepfake identification, our method offers comprehensive localization of changed regions, which provides important information about which specific facial features have been altered. This feature improves the model’s usefulness in cybersecurity, social media content moderation, and identity verification. This research extends the field of deepfake identification and helps to build more dependable and secure digital systems by tackling the detection as well as the localization of fake characteristics.},

  abstract={The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology into satellite-based Internet services offers a new method for optimizing predictive beamforming that will boost both ease of use and cost efficiency.Old-fashioned beamforming technique is based on determinism and historical information methods which often cannot adapt to environmental change, network congestion or user mobility. This article explores how generative AI models (like variational autoencoders [VAEs], generative adversarial networks [GANs], or transformer-based architectures) can help to forecast optimal level settings for a beam in real-time.Using huge amounts of satellite telemetry, weather patterns and user traffic data, generative AI can synthesize realistic future network states, cut down on latency and improve signal coverage.AI-driven beamforming entails architectural considerations, training methodologies, and deployment issues. In addition to our review of the performance metrics such as beam alignment accuracy or spectral efficiency, we match nextgeneration predictive models against traditional methods based on statistical analysis and other data manipulation techniques. The results suggest that generative AI can bring a great enhancement to satellite Internet services. This new technology will not only improve coverage but also reduce handover failure rates and power allocation, establishing the groundwork for nextgeneration satellite communication systems that are AI-first.},

  abstract={As an acute disease, facial paralysis has high requirements for the point of treatment, and if we cannot accurately grasp the period in which the patient is suffering from the disease, we may miss the optimal time for treatment, which may affect the condition. We need to establish intelligent auxiliary diagnosis methods for facial palsy, in which AI-based methods rely on a large number of training samples. However, facial paralysis image samples are small, resulting in low model accuracy, which cannot meet the needs of clinical applications. Therefore, we plan to expand the facial palsy samples through data augmentation methods to reduce the training sample requirements and improve the accuracy of facial palsy grading. We propose the method of fusing generative adversarial networks, where the collected facial paralysis samples are trained by DragGAN model to expand the sample space, and then input into ResNet152 model for classification training. The classification effect of facial palsy images is effectively improved by the principle of data augmentation before classification. The accuracy of this experimental method on the MEEI facial palsy dataset is 85.5%, the recall is 81.4%, and the F1-score is 80.7%, which are 13.1%, 16.7%, and 15.8%, respectively compared to the method without data augmentation. A facial palsy classification model incorporating generative adversarial networks achieves higher classification accuracy compared to methods without data augmentation, providing a new approach to facial palsy classification.},

  abstract={Recent deep learning network models have been enhanced dramatically to generating images, removing objects, and improving resolution of images. From a pragmatic purpose, we must utilize it to solve some occurrent real-world problems, for example, facial mask removal. People's frequency of wearing masks has increased rapidly due to the pandemic. The objective of this research is to remove the facial mask on face images using generative adversarial network, or GAN, model. We set up three different training process to explore how to remove a facial mask effectively. By comparing among these training processes, we find out that adding an additional binary mask segmentation is conducive to both the generation quality of face region other than mask and inpainting quality of missing mask region. Moreover, our customized GAN model outperforms the Pix2Pix GAN model in both region inpainting.},

  abstract={Generating image and video is a hot topic in Deep Learning. Especially, generating video is a difficult but meaningful work. How to generate video which has diversity and plausibility is still a problem to be solved. In this paper, we propose a novel model of Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) which called FDGAN to generate clear contour lines. Unlike existing GAN that only use frames, our method extends to use inter-frame difference. First introduce two temporal difference methods to process the inter-frame. Then increase a frame difference discriminator to discriminate whether the inter-frame is true or not. Using the model and new structure proposed, we perform video generation experiments on several widely used benchmark datasets such as MOVING MNIST, UCF-101. Consequently, the results achieve state-of-the-art performance for clarifying contour lines. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations were made to show the effectiveness of our methods.},

This chapter discusses the milestones achieved in GenAI. It examines its increasingly widespread applications for text and images. The chapter provides an overview of the technology and its evolution and retracing its origins in natural language models, generative adversarial networks, and reinforcement learning. Besides AI models for text, some models are also capable of producing images, based on stable diffusion technology. Tokenization is a common procedure in natural language processing in order to split text into tokens and remove any less useful or confounding information. Generative adversarial networks represent another kind of deep learning technology that can give readers an even stronger illusion that the AI can display creativity. Diffusion models are another generative technology that has changed digital content creation.</p>},

  volume={36},

  pages={4054-4065},
  abstract={Zero-shot learning casts light on lacking unseen class data by transferring knowledge from seen classes via a joint semantic space. However, the distributions of samples from seen and unseen classes are usually imbalanced. Many zero-shot learning methods fail to obtain satisfactory results in the generalized zero-shot learning task, where seen and unseen classes are all used for the test. Also, irregular structures of some classes may result in inappropriate mapping from visual features space to semantic attribute space. A novel generative mixup networks with semantic graph alignment is proposed in this article to mitigate such problems. To be specific, our model first attempts to synthesize samples conditioned with class-level semantic information as the prototype to recover the class-based feature distribution from the given semantic description. Second, the proposed model explores a mixup mechanism to augment training samples and improve the generalization ability of the model. Third, triplet gradient matching loss is developed to guarantee the class invariance to be more continuous in the latent space, and it can help the discriminator distinguish the real and fake samples. Finally, a similarity graph is constructed from semantic attributes to capture the intrinsic correlations and guides the feature generation process. Extensive experiments conducted on several zero-shot learning benchmarks from different tasks prove that the proposed model can achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-art generalized zero-shot learning.},

  abstract={Recently, the rapid growth of cloud computing has created a vast attack surface for malware threats. The existing Support Vector Machine (SVM) accurately detected malwares although the dynamic nature of cloud environments led to high-dimensional data and class imbalance issues. Hence, this research proposes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to address the class imbalance by creating synthetic malware samples. Initially, the input data is collected and fed into the analysis phase with Cuckoo Sandbox to generate malware behavior report in JavaScript Objective Notation (JSON) format. After that, Trend Micro Locality Sensitive Hashing (TLSH) is employed to measure the similarity among files and then the clustering phase groups the similar files as a cluster according to hash values. Further, the features are extracted from JSON format which contains information on Application Programming Interface (API) calls and their return codes. Then, the optimal features are selected using Chi-square to calculate the statistical independence on each feature and finally, GAN model is used to detect malware in cloud environments. From the results, the proposed GAN achieved better results in terms of accuracy (99.61%) when compared to existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN).},

  abstract={Autonomous systems are making their way to the market. The transition from tasks performed by humans to tasks performed by machines begs for an answer to one of the most challenging questions in this area of research: Will humans understand and trust what a machine does? Analyzing human and machine behaviors offers the foundational steps toward finding answers to this question. This paper contributes a novel methodology for transforming low-level actions by each agent into high-level categorization of strategies to contrast the behaviors of humans and machines using a computational red teaming environment with a red (evader) and a blue (pursuer) agent. Two orthogonal sources of uncertainty were examined: the uncertainty in the blue agent's situation awareness about the red, and the red agent's uncertainty resulting from deceptive actions by the blue. For each uncertainty source, two different experiments were conducted by varying the controller of the red agent. In one experiment, the red agent was controlled by one of the 34 human subjects; and in the second, by an evolved neural network. The blue agent was controlled by a scripted rule-based system. In this time-critical task, the results revealed that humans tend to follow systemic and consistent strategies, sometimes ignoring the information available to them. On the other hand, machines tend to evolve more complex and diverse strategies. This finding calls for new computational intelligence techniques to enable the fusion of these different strategies into forms that each party can understand and use effectively.},

  abstract={This research aimed to create and evaluate a hedonic motivation model to comprehend elderly citizens’ acceptance of generative artificial intelligence. The age-related cognitive ability traits and perceived boredom of the elderly were added to the earlier technology acceptance model in the proposed hedonic motivation and flow model. The theoretical model was empirically evaluated using survey questionnaire data of 314 respondents over 55 years. The result showed that cognitive ability significantly impacted perceived ease-of-use, impacting all five hedonic variables. Flow experience was impacted by curiosity and joy but not by control. It was also found that perceived usefulness did not impact usage, while boredom and flow experience impacted usage of GAI-assisted personalized elderly care. The study stated implications for theory and practice before concluding with future research directions.},

  abstract={Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) is a rapidly growing field that focuses on making deep learning models interpretable and understandable to human decision-makers. In this study, we introduce xAAEnet, a novel xAI model applied to the assessment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) severity. OSA is a prevalent sleep disorder that can lead to numerous medical conditions and is currently assessed using the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI). However, AHI has been criticized for its inability to accurately estimate the effect of OSAs on related medical conditions. To address this issue, we propose a human-centric xAI approach that emphasizes similarity between apneic events as a whole and reduces subjectivity in diagnosis by examining how the model makes its decisions. Our model was trained and tested on a dataset of 60 patients’ Polysomnographic (PSG) recordings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model, xAAEnet, outperforms models with traditional architectures such as convolutional regressor, autoencoder (AE), and variational autoencoder (VAE). This study highlights the potential of xAI in providing an objective OSA severity scoring method.Clinical relevance— This study provides an objective OSA severity scoring technique which could improve the management of apneic patients in clinical practice.},

  abstract={Text-to-image synthesis is the task of synthesizing realistic and text-matching images according to given text descriptions. Most text-to-image generative networks consist of two modules: a pre-trained text-image encoder and a text-to-image generative adversarial network. In this paper, we propose a stronger text encoder which employs a text Transformer to extract semantically meaningful parts from text descriptions. With the stronger text encoder, the generator can obtain more meaningful text information to synthesize realistic and text-matching images. In addition, we propose a Dynamic Convolutional text-image Fusion Generative Adversarial Network (DCFGAN) which employs the Dynamic Convolutional Fusion Block to fuse text and image features efficiently. The Dynamic Convolutional Fusion block adjusts the parameters in the convolution layer according to different text descriptions to synthesize text-matching images. It improves the efficiency of fusing text features and image features in generator network. We evaluate the proposed DCF-GAN on two benchmark datasets, the CUB and the Oxford-102. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed stronger text encoder and Dynamic Convolutional Fusion Layer can greatly promote the performance of text-to-image synthesis.},

This study investigates these concerns through a comparative analysis of stakeholder perspectives. A total of 252 participants were surveyed, with the analysis focusing on 110 valid responses from parents/educators and 100 from AI professionals after data cleaning. Quantitative methods, including descriptive statistics and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, examined five validated constructs: Data Ownership and Control, Parental Data Sharing, Perceived Risks and Benefits, Transparency and Trust, and Education and Awareness. Results showed Education and Awareness significantly influenced data ownership and risk assessment, while Data Ownership and Control strongly impacted Transparency and Trust. Transparency and Trust, along with Perceived Risks and Benefits, showed minimal influence on Parental Data Sharing, suggesting other factors may play a larger role. The study underscores the need for user-centric privacy controls, tailored transparency strategies, and targeted educational initiatives.

The proposed method is experimentally proved to be capable to alleviate the data insufficiency problem and build more competitive AI programs than conventional supervised training methods.},

  abstract={The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies into the lives of young digital citizens has escalated privacy concerns and the need for critical examination. This study uses Communication Privacy Management (CPM) Theory to understand how youth and critical stakeholders navigate these concerns. A total of 306 participants were surveyed, comprising 146 AI professionals, 127 parents and educators and 33 youths (aged 16-19). Employing a mixed-methods approach, the research combined quantitative data from structured questionnaires with qualitative insights from open-ended responses. Descriptive statistics reveal distinct perspectives among different demographics regarding data ownership, education, transparency and trust, parental role and perceived risks and benefits associated with AI systems. Structural equation modelling identified key influences on youth privacy management, highlighting the significance of transparency and trust, education and awareness, and parental data sharing among AI professionals, parents, educators, and young digital citizens. The qualitative analysis further underscored unique concerns, emphasizing a lack of understanding and data misuse contributed to the feeling of helplessness shared by all stakeholders. This study underscores the importance of integrating diverse stakeholders’ perspectives in the development of AI systems to address the complex challenges faced by youth. Recommendations include collaborative policymaking, implementing user-centric design practices, and enhancing privacy education to empower young digital citizens.},

  title={Between Generating Noise and Generating Images: Noise in the Correct Frequency Improves the Quality of Synthetic Histopathology Images for Digital Pathology}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have the promise to revolutionize the field of digital pathology. However, these models demand considerable amounts of data, while the availability of unbiased training data is limited. Synthetic images can augment existing datasets, to improve and validate AI algorithms. Yet, controlling the exact distribution of cellular features within them is still challenging. One of the solutions is harnessing conditional generative adversarial networks that take a semantic mask as an input rather than a random noise. Unlike other domains, outlining the exact cellular structure of tissues is hard, and most of the input masks depict regions of cell types. This is also the case for non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer. Deciding whether a patient would receive immunotherapy depends on quantifying regions of stained cells. However, using polygon-based masks introduce inherent artifacts within the synthetic images – due to the mismatch between the polygon size and the single-cell size. In this work, we show that introducing random single-pixel noise with the appropriate spatial frequency into a polygon semantic mask can dramatically improve the quality of the synthetic images. We used our platform to generate synthetic images of immunohistochemistry-treated lung biopsies. We test the quality of the images using a three-fold validation procedure. First, we show that adding the appropriate noise frequency yields 87% of the similarity metrics improvement that is obtained by adding the actual single-cell features. Second, we show that the synthetic images pass the Turing test. Finally, we show that adding these synthetic images to the train set improves AI performance in terms of PD-L1 semantic segmentation performances. Our work suggests a simple and powerful approach for generating synthetic data on demand to unbias limited datasets to improve the algorithms’ accuracy and validate their robustness.},

  abstract={In edge computing environment, dynamic offloading complex tasks is a key issue that affects the overall system performance and user experience. In cloud-edge-end collaborative systems, efficiently offloading tasks with dependencies and data sensitivity, while maximizing resource allocation and quality of service, is a challenging problem for edge service providers.To address this, we propose an optimization method based on the Generative Adversarial Q Network (GAQN).By incorporating Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), we enhance Q-value estimation, improving the accuracy and stability of the policy. Specifically, we model complex task offloading in edge computing as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Then,We design and implement GAQN, combining a generative adversarial network with a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) to optimize task scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that GAQN exhibits good stability and convergence with proper training, yielding optimal Q values. In terms of service quality, GAQN effectively reduces total system delay and energy consumption. Additionally, GAQN adapts to different network environments and efficiently handles task dependencies and data sensitivity, ensuring data privacy and smooth task execution.},

  abstract={Background: AI-enabled digital twins (DTs) are advanced virtual models of a complex real-world system, which have the potential to transform clinical decision-making. Despite the growing interest in such DTs, the literature lacks a unified framework for their development and implementation. Objective: This study aims to map the existing knowledge on AI-enabled DTs for clinical decision-making, and develop a comprehensive framework for their development and implementation. Methods: Informed by frameworks established by Arksey and O'Malley, and the Joanna Briggs Institute, we performed a scoping review of studies on the development and implementation of AI-enabled DTs for clinical decision-making in any healthcare setting. The search strategy was developed by a librarian for three databases from the date of inception until August 2023. We also conducted a grey literature search on Google Scholar. One reviewer screened titles and abstracts, full-text articles, and charted data, and the second reviewer verified them. Quantitative data were summarized using frequency and proportions, and qualitative data were summarized using content analysis. Key steps in DT development were identified to create the DECIDE-Twin framework. Results: Eleven articles were included: seven reviews and four empirical studies. The reviews contained either a framework or information that was used to construct our comprehensive framework. The empirical studies reported the DT development, and one reported a common infrastructure for a wide range of DT applications. Conclusion: We developed the DECIDE-Twin framework that could serve as a guide for researchers and practitioners in DT development and implementation for clinical decision-making. Further research is needed to validate and implement this framework for various clinical applications.},

  abstract={Recognizing prohibited items in X-ray security checking images automatically based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has attracted attention increasingly. However, there are no suitable X-ray security checking image databases to train a reliable CNN model. Therefore, we propose a data augmentation method for X-ray security checking images. First, a lot of new X-ray prohibited item images are generated using the improved Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN). Next, a Cycle GAN based method is proposed to transform the item natural images into the X-ray images. It can enrich the diversity of the new images, including item shape and pose. Then, we combine the prohibited item images with background images to synthesize the new X-ray security checking images. Finally, two single shot multi-box detector (SSD) models are applied to verify whether the enlarged database has achieved data augmentation. Experimental results show that the performance of SSD model trained by the enlarged database is better than the SSD model trained by the original database. It implies that our method can achieve data augmentation for X-ray security checking images effectively.},

  abstract={Airborne platforms and satellites provide rich sensor data in the form of hyperspectral images (HSI), which are crucial for numerous vision-related tasks, such as feature extraction, image enhancement, and data synthesis. This article reviews the contextual importance and applications of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in the advancement of HSI processing. GAI methods address the inherent challenges of HSI data, such as high dimensionality, noise, and the need to preserve spectral-spatial correlations, rendering them indispensable for modern HSI analysis. Generative neural networks, including generative adversarial networks and denoising diffusion probabilistic models, are highlighted for their superior performance in classification, segmentation, and object identification tasks, often surpassing traditional approaches, such as U-Nets, autoencoders, and deep convolutional neural networks. Diffusion models showed competitive performance in tasks, such as feature extraction and image resolution enhancement, particularly in terms of inference time and computational cost. Transformer architectures combined with attention mechanisms further improved the accuracy of generative methods, particularly for preserving spectral and spatial information in tasks, such as image translation, data augmentation, and data synthesis. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, particularly in developing computationally efficient models for super-resolution and data synthesis. In addition, novel evaluation metrics tailored to the complex nature of HSI data are needed. This review underscores the potential of GAI in addressing these challenges while presenting its current strengths, limitations, and future research directions.},

  abstract={Partial discharge is one of the most popular fault in power system, and the popularity of 5 G makes it possible to analyze partial discharge faults using artificial intelligence algorithms. Low frequency and high collection cost of partial discharge faults lead to the problems of small sample size and imbalance sample, which bring challenges to partial discharge fault detection of 5G based power intelligence system. Hence, in this paper, an data augmentation method that named SVAEWGAN is proposed, which based on stacked variational autocoding and Wasserstein generative adversarial network for partial discharge fault samples in transmission lines to generate fault samples and improve the diversity of samples. Firstly, the stack variational autoencoder is used to extract the depth features of the fault waveform. Secondly, a partial discharge fault sample generation model is constructed by combining stacked variational autocoding and Wasserstein generative adversarial network, and a partial discharge fault detection framework based on the data augmentation method is proposed. Finally, the performance of partial discharge fault detection algorithm based on LightGBM and Bi-LSTM-Attention before and after using data augmentation method is compared and analyzed based on VSB fault detection dataset by selecting accuracy and F1 score, etc. Experiments show that the data augmentation method can effectively improve the performance of partial discharge fault detection, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Generating diverse and realistic malware variants is critical to improve the performance of deep learning-based Malware Detection Systems (MDSs) and fight against an increasing number of complex malware attacks. Traditionally, researchers construct the single generative model based on the whole dataset, which may suffer from mode collapse and scalability problem. In order to overcome these problems, we propose Multi-level Generative Pretrained Transformer (MLGPT) which organizes multiple GPTs in the tree. Each GPT in the tree can learn the unique pattern of malware language for one malware subfamily. Consequently, MLGPT has great potentials to produce more diverse and realistic malware variants than the single generative model. Experimental results show that performance improvement of MLGPT is statistically significant as compared to the single generative model while the construction time of MLGPT is comparable to the single generative model due to the parallel strategy.},

  year={2025},
  volume={44},
  number={8},
  pages={3196-3209},
  abstract={Foundation models have attracted significant attention for their impressive generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, they are demonstrated to exhibit great limitations in representing high-frequency components and fine-grained details. In many medical imaging tasks, precise representation of such information is crucial due to the inherently intricate anatomical structures, sub-visual features, and complex boundaries involved. Consequently, the limited representation of prevalent foundation models can result in considerable performance degradation or even failure in these tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pretraining strategy for both 2D images and 3D volumes, named Frequency-advanced Representation Autoencoder (Frepa). Through high-frequency masking and low-frequency perturbation combined with embedding consistency learning, Frepa encourages the encoder to effectively represent and preserve high-frequency components in the image embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an innovative histogram-equalized image masking strategy, extending the Masked Autoencoder approach beyond ViT to other architectures such as Swin-Transformer and convolutional networks. We develop Frepa across nine medical modalities and validate it on 32 downstream tasks for both 2D images and 3D volumes. Without fine-tuning, Frepa can outperform other self-supervised pretraining methods and, in some cases, even surpasses task-specific foundation models. This improvement is particularly significant for tasks involving fine-grained details, such as achieving up to a +15% increase in dice score for retina vessel segmentation and a +8% increase in IoU for lung tumor detection. Further experiment quantitatively reveals that Frepa enables superior high-frequency representations and preservation in the embeddings, underscoring its potential for developing more generalized and universal medical image foundation models.},

  abstract={Ancient buildings, as an integral part of human cultural heritage, face tilting issues that not only affect their aesthetic appeal but may also lead to structural instability or even collapse, posing serious threats to building safety and human lives. Traditional monitoring methods rely on physical sensors and manual inspections, which suffer from limitations such as data scarcity, low prediction accuracy, and poor real-time performance. To address these challenges, this study proposes a generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based tilting prediction model for ancient buildings. By leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation, diverse combinations of tilting and contributing factor data are generated, effectively resolving the issue of data scarcity. The model adopts a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture, with inputs including contributing factors such as foundation settlement, vibration frequency, temperature, and humidity, and outputs including tilt angles and tilt rates, enabling accurate capture of complex nonlinear relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that the model significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization ability, and its effectiveness is validated through a real-world monitoring system. This study provides scientific and technical support for early warning and preventive conservation of ancient building tilting, offering significant theoretical value and practical application.},

  abstract={Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated impressive performance in medical image segmentation, particularly for low-contrast and small medical objects. However, current DRL-based segmentation methods face limitations due to the optimization of error propagation in two separate stages and the need for a significant amount of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel deep generative adversarial reinforcement learning (DGARL) approach that, for the first time, enables end-to-end semi-supervised medical image segmentation in the DRL domain. DGARL ingeniously establishes a pipeline that integrates DRL and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to optimize both detection and segmentation tasks holistically while mutually enhancing each other. Specifically, DGARL introduces two innovative components to facilitate this integration in semi-supervised settings. First, a task-joint GAN with two discriminators links the detection results to the GAN’s segmentation performance evaluation, allowing simultaneous joint evaluation and feedback. This ensures that DRL and GAN can be directly optimized based on each other’s results. Second, a bidirectional exploration DRL integrates backward exploration and forward exploration to ensure the DRL agent explores the correct direction when forward exploration is disabled due to lack of explicit rewards. This mitigates the issue of unlabeled data being unable to provide rewards and rendering DRL unexplorable. Comprehensive experiments on three generalization datasets, comprising a total of 640 patients, demonstrate that our novel DGARL achieves 85.02% Dice and improves at least 1.91% for brain tumors, achieves 73.18% Dice and improves at least 4.28% for liver tumors, and achieves 70.85% Dice and improves at least 2.73% for pancreas compared to the ten most recent advanced methods, our results attest to the superiority of DGARL. Code is available at GitHub.},

  abstract={The evolution of technology and science has brought groundbreaking developments to the current visual arts, and the application of digital technology has brought significant changes to the creation and aesthetic taste of traditional art. This study, therefore, investigates the current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and applications in generating visual art while giving a brief history of the intersection of AI and art, including the milestone advancements in neural networks. Fifteen interviews were conducted with technical artists who use text-to-image AI generators to gather data. Based on the findings from the interviews, the state-of-the-art applications were reviewed and analyzed in six categories: Accessibility, Barrier to Entry, Novelty, Ethics and Morality, Control, Non-fungible tokens (NFT) and Monetization which were widely discussed along with their success and limitations. The research concludes with three main findings; (a) monetization of digital media through NFTs that has a direct impact on the advancement of art generating AI applications, (b) there is a significant change in the traditional creative process with the integration of AI applications, and AI is not just a tool but it's a creative agent that artists collaborate with (c) art generating AI applications can generate limitless possibilities within the same aesthetics as a result revolutionize the way humans create and interact with art.},

  pages={437-442},
  abstract={Robot monitoring has been widely applied to observe the operation of welding robots, but the arc generated during the welding process causes severe overexposure in local areas of robot surveillance images, significantly deteriorating the monitoring effect of the welding robots. Due to the complex background structure of robot welding images, existing methods produce poor quality images after filtering out the arc from robot welding images. In this study, we propose an arc filtering model based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), primarily aimed at filtering out the arc in robot welding images. The well-trained arc filtering model can effectively eliminate the arc in robot welding images, generating high-quality non-arcing images. Experimental studies were conducted using an industrial robot welding image dataset we built autonomously and compared with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed model.},

  year={2025},

  pages={1294-1299},
  abstract={By predicting and maintaining the failures in transportation systems such as trains and large vehicles, companies can improve operational efficiency. In particular, failures in brake-related components can lead to serious accidents, making it crucial to predict such failures. However, the data collected from transportation systems is often unstable and includes missing values due to factors such as sensor failures and battery discharge. This can lead to a lack of data for future analysis and incorrect results. Although various studies have attempted to address this issue, they have not considered the characteristics and uncertainties of the attributes that significantly impact failures. Therefore, this study applies explainable artificial intelligence to the preprocessed data to classify the attributes that significantly influence failures and uses a quantum algorithm-based stochastic differential equation to model the uncertainties by reflecting attribute characteristics in the process of handling missing values. By applying quantum algorithm to estimate the final missing data, this study enhances both the completeness of the data and the accuracy of product failure identification. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, missing values in a transportation dataset are estimated in two cases: air production unit data and air pressure system data related to the brake system in transportation. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the proposed approach, as compared with other algorithms, was demonstrated.},

  abstract={Quantum computers are next-generation devices that hold promise to perform calculations beyond the reach of classical computers. A leading method towards achieving this goal is through quantum machine learning, especially quantum generative learning. Due to the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, it is reasonable to postulate that quantum generative learning models (QGLMs) may surpass their classical counterparts. As such, QGLMs are receiving growing attention from the quantum physics and computer science communities, where various QGLMs that can be efficiently implemented on near-term quantum machines with potential computational advantages are proposed. In this paper, we review the current progress of QGLMs from the perspective of machine learning. Particularly, we interpret these QGLMs, covering quantum circuit Born machines, quantum generative adversarial networks, quantum Boltzmann machines, and quantum variational autoencoders, as the quantum extension of classical generative learning models. In this context, we explore their intrinsic relations and their fundamental differences. We further summarize the potential applications of QGLMs in both conventional machine learning tasks and quantum physics. Last, we discuss the challenges and further research directions for QGLMs.},

  pages={517-521},
  abstract={Single image raindrop removal is an extremely challenging task since the raindrop regions of various shapes and sizes are not given and the background information of the occluded regions is completely lost for most part. In this paper, a novel two-stage residual adaptive mask generative adversarial network (RAM-GAN) is developed for single image raindrop removal, in which the raindrop regions can be automatically detected and a restored image without raindrops is generated. Moreover, the residual adaptive mask block (RAMB) structures and residual dense adaptive mask modules (RDAMM) are proposed to be the main components constructing the network. The proposed RAMB structure can serve as a feature selector which adaptively enhances the effective information and suppress the invalid information. Each block is processed into two branches: soft mask branch and trunk branch. A mask is generated by the soft mask branch to softly weigh the features processed by the trunk branch. In addition, RDAMM, the residual densely connected module based on RAMB structure, is proposed to maximize the information flow among different blocks and guarantee better convergence. Our experimental results have demonstrated that our method can effectively remove raindrops while well preserving the image details, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming ophthalmology by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, optimizing treatment strategies, and expanding access to quality eye care. AI-powered machine learning and deep learning models analyze vast ophthalmic datasets, enabling the early detection of diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). These technologies improve image interpretation from fundus photography and optical coherence tomography, providing ophthalmologists with precise assessments of retinal health and disease progression. Beyond diagnostics, AI contributes to ophthalmic surgery by increasing precision in robotic-assisted procedures and enhancing preoperative planning. AI-driven teleophthalmology further reduces healthcare gaps by enabling remote screenings and consultations, particularly in low-access regions. Furthermore, AI-based automation improves clinical workflows, reducing administrative burdens and optimizing resource allocation. Despite its advantages, AI adoption in ophthalmology faces challenges, including data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, and the need for regulatory approval. For widespread implementation, it is fundamental to ensure diverse, high-quality datasets and achieve seamless integration with existing healthcare systems. This study explores AI-driven advancements in ophthalmology, highlighting current applications, benefits, limitations, and future research directions. By leveraging AI, the field of ophthalmology is poised for a paradigm shift, improving patient outcomes and revolutionizing eye care globally.},
