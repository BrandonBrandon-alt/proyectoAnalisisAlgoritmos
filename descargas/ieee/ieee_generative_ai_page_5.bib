  abstract={Edge intelligence (EI), by leveraging abundant edge resources and positioning AI algorithms closer to end-users, has long been considered a fundamental catalyst for the AI industry. As the AI realm shifts towards new Generative AI (GAI), EI offers a broader data source, reduced latency, and enhanced privacy protections, making it a more conducive environment for GAI advancements than cloud-based approaches. However, compared to traditional AI models, GAI challenges existing EI with its significantly larger model size, markedly intricate operations, and substantially heightened resource demands. This article delves deeply into the evolution of EI in the upcoming GAI era. Particularly, we first provide a thorough overview of challenges introduced by GAI, including escalated communication costs, greater computational demands, and intensified security and privacy concerns. We then extend the EI scope to encompass the entire lifecycle of GAI within EI, while jointly considering sensing, communication, and computation against these emerging challenges. Additionally, we spotlight key techniques designed to pave the way for the future of EI, elaborating on each of these in detail. To provide concrete insights into how EI adapts for GAI, we present two illustrative case studies: one focusing on diffusion model-based GAI fine-tuning in vehicular networks and the other highlighting large language model-based real-time inference offloading in wireless edge networks. Lastly, we outline three future research directions for EI, guided by the latest advancements in GAI.},

  abstract={Digital literacy plays an important role in teachers’ professional competence, especially in the context of digital transformation in education. With the advancement of digital technology, enhancing learners’ high awareness ability in digital literacy has become a key step in literacy development. On this basis, this study employed the response surface methodology (RSM) to evaluate various test indicators, including the number of words, number of answer points, and number of follow-up rounds, and evaluation indicators, including accuracy, expansion, and awareness, for generative artificial intelligence (GAI). A four-step process was followed that includes basic analysis of experiment results, factor estimation and variance analysis, multifactor response surface analysis, and indicator analysis. The findings indicate that the test factors related to the GAI-generated content had a significant impact on participants’ high awareness levels. These factors exhibited interactive effects, and the response surface model revealed an optimal approach for applying GAI to enhance awareness. Building on these insights, practical suggestions are proposed for using GAI to enhance digital literacy. On the basis of the research conclusions, practical approaches to applying GAI to enhance high awareness ability in digital literacy are proposed. These approaches include employing the critical point perturbation mechanism, role-oriented mechanism, and high awareness thinking chain mechanism. This study employed GAI to investigate learners’ high awareness ability in digital literacy, providing a case for the proper and innovative use of GAI in the context of education. Additionally, it provides information on the educational effectiveness of GAI and offers valuable references for similar studies on GAI applications.},

  abstract={Graphics algorithms for high quality image rendering are highly involved process, as layout, components, and light transport must be explicitly simulated. While existing algorithms excel in this task, creating and formatting virtual environments is a costly and time-consuming process. Thus, there is an opportunity for automating this labor intensive process by leveraging recent development in computer vision. Recent development in deep generative models, especially GANs, has spurred much interest in the computer vision domain for synthesizing realistic images. GANs combine backpropagation with a competitive process involving a pair networks, called Generative Network G and Discriminative Network D, in which G generate artificial images and D classifies it into real or artificial image categories. As the training proceeds, G learns to generate realistic images to confuse D [1]. In this work, a convolutional architecture based on GAN, specifically Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) has been implemented to train a generative model that can produce good quality images of human faces at scale. CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) has been used to train the DCGAN model. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), that measures the structural and contextual similarity of two images, has been used for quantitative evaluation of the trained DCGAN model. Obtained results shows that the quality of generated images is quite similar to the high quality images of the CelebA dataset.},

  abstract={Designing programs is a purposeful method of implementing design plans in a scientific manner, playing a key role in normative design processes, improving efficiency, ensuring quality, and guiding creativity in artistic design. However, traditional design processes are often constrained by factors such as human resources, time costs, and experience limitations, resulting in inefficiency and limited creativity. Generative artificial intelligence is providing new possibilities for optimizing design processes. This article proposes an optimized design program strategy that can improve the efficiency of design programs, reduce design costs, and enhance design quality by introducing generative artificial intelligence. In addition, the optimized design program is evaluated from aspects such as the efficiency of process execution, the quality of design results, and the participation and satisfaction of team members to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Findings of this study can help researchers and practitioners develop and optimize models that are more suitable for content output, promoting their application in the field of artistic design.},

  abstract={Since its first appearance, artificial intelligence has been ensuring revolutionary outcomes in the context of real-world problems. At this point, it has strong relations with biomedical and today&#x2019;s intelligent systems compete with human capabilities in medical tasks. However, advanced use of artificial intelligence causes intelligent systems to be black-box. That situation is not good for building trustworthy intelligent systems in medical applications. For a remarkable amount of time, researchers have tried to solve the black-box issue by using modular additions, which have led to the rise of the term: interpretable artificial intelligence. As the literature matured (as a result of, in particular, deep learning), that term transformed into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). This book provides an essential edited work regarding the latest advancements in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for biomedical applications. It includes not only introductive perspectives but also applied touches and discussions regarding critical problems as well as future insights. Topics discussed in the book include: &#x2022; XAI for the applications with medical images &#x2022; XAI use cases for alternative medical data/task &#x2022; Different XAI methods for biomedical applications &#x2022; Reviews for the XAI research for critical biomedical problems. Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Biomedical Applications is ideal for academicians, researchers, students, engineers, and experts from the fields of computer science, biomedical, medical, and health sciences. It also welcomes all readers of different fields to be informed about use cases of XAI in black-box artificial intelligence. In this sense, the book can be used for both teaching and reference source purposes.},

  abstract={Applications of artificial intelligence in medical imaging include classification, segmentation, and treatment planning. Using current deep-learning techniques, developing these systems requires large amounts of labelled training data. Obtaining this data is challenging due to costs, required expertise, inconsistency of imaging procedures and formatting, and patient privacy concerns. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) may alleviate some of these issues by supplying realistic artificial medical images. In this study, we trained progressively growing (PG)GAN to synthesize full-sized computed tomography (CT) images and succeeded. Performance of the PGGAN was evaluated using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS), and Precision (P) and Recall (R). These metrics were calculated for generated, training, and validation images. The influence of dataset size was explored by varying the number of samples used to calculate each metric; this affected FID, P, and R, but not IS, which has obvious implications for comparing studies. The FID between artificial CT images from PGGAN and real validation images was 42; interestingly, FID between real training and validation images was 24. This suggests that a further reduction of 18 could be achieved by improving the generative model. Overall, artificial CT images generated by PGGAN were almost indistinguishable from real images to the human eye, although computational metrics could identify differences between them. In future work, GANs may be deployed to augment data for training medical AI systems.},

  abstract={The utilization of Generative AI (GEN AI) has experienced a substantial increase because of investments and a variety of applications in various sectors. In 2023, the aggregate investment in generative AI exceeded $10 billion. Additionally, AI is a highly prevalent technology in China, with 83% of its companies significantly relying on it. Subsequently, India accounts for 73% of Gen AI usage, while Malaysia's data suggests that this technology is employed in the marketing sector. This investment has resulted in an increased utilization of AI tools in the areas of retail, supply chain management, and customer service. This technology enhances productivity, efficiency, and creativity in a variety of sectors. Nevertheless, it raises a few challenges that necessitate robust governance and regulation. GEN AI prioritizes transparency and accountability; AI systems could perpetuate prejudices and erode trust in the absence of regulations. In the context of contemporary concerns, this paper assesses the regulatory endeavors and issues of Malaysia and India with respect to Generative AI. This paper employs doctrinal research on primary and secondary sources. Malaysia and India have recently disclosed a variety of data breaches and unethical Gen AI practices. Therefore, even though Generative AI is streamlining marketing and assisting in numerous business sectors, the government must re-evaluate its governance, including legal and regulatory mechanisms, to determine whether it complies with international standards and contemplate reforms. The government must also look into balancing the need for innovation and evaluate data protection and privacy concerns.},

  abstract={Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) hold immense potential to revolutionize transportation, yet their deployment raises significant concerns regarding safety, security, and ethical considerations. Furthermore, the increased use of automation, edge computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), fueled by generative AI technology, has increasingly elevated the risks of AI. Most of the existing research only covers ethical components and lacks the breadth of Responsible AI (RAI), while some have presented components such as justice and solidarity but do not provide an approach or mechanism to implement those in an AI-based system. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a comprehensive RAI framework for AVs with four key contributions. First, it provides an in-depth analysis of AI risks in AVs, encompassing safety, security, ethical, and legal domains, offering a structured classification to guide developers and regulators. Second, it introduces a holistic RAI framework that spans the AI lifecycle, identifying and mitigating risks at each AV system development and deployment stage. Third, the paper focuses on bias and fairness within AV systems, outlining precise techniques for bias detection and mitigation across data collection, algorithm design, and real-time decision-making. Lastly, the research presents bias removal simulations using publicly available AV datasets, evaluating mitigation strategies such as synthetic data generation and algorithmic fairness analysis. The proposed framework and simulations provide a practical foundation for integrating RAI principles into AV development, ensuring safer, fairer, and more accountable AI-driven mobility solutions.},

  abstract={The traditional college English teaching model has the problems of insufficient classroom interaction and limited personalized feedback, which makes it difficult to meet the personalized learning needs of students. To this end, this paper proposes a multimodal teaching framework based on BERToptimized generative AI and digital twin classrooms. By enhancing language comprehension ability through BERT, combining intelligent dialogue systems and digital twin technology, it optimizes classroom interaction and improves personalized learning support. This study adopts an experimental control design and conducts a comparative analysis of 200 college students. The results show that the number of questions in AI-enhanced classrooms increased by $35 \%$, the number of teacher-student dialogues increased by $50 \%$, and the proportion of group discussion time increased by $25 \%$. In terms of learning outcomes, the writing scores of students in the experimental group increased by 1.8 points (out of 10 points), oral fluency increased by $20 \%$, and reading comprehension accuracy increased by $15 \%$, all of which were significantly better than those in the control group. Generative AI combined with multimodal teaching and digital twin technology can effectively improve classroom interactivity and learning outcomes, provide a new direction for the development of intelligent education, and provide theoretical support for the application of AI in language teaching.},

The data stored on a blockchain is immutable and secured with cryptography. The blockchain can guarantee data security without the involvement of a third party. The integration of it with AI to create distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) is increasingly being used in various areas of human activity. AI can increase the efficiency of blockchains by streamlining computations and processes, reducing the burden on miners and decreasing latency. The latter results in faster transactions and reduced carbon footprint of the blockchain technology. Blockchain can help develop explainable AI by means of accessing an immutable record of unstructured medical data and processes used by the system in its decision-making process.

  abstract={Fluorescence imaging in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) facilitates the real-time optical contrast for in vivo biomedical imaging. However, the detection noise is an inevitable byproduct of the real-time imaging process. Additionally, fluorescent probes currently approved for clinical use remain limited within the wavelength of NIR-IIa (1000–1300 nm). NIR-IIb (1500–1700 nm) imaging has the potential to deliver higher resolution than NIR-IIa, but relies on toxic fluorescent probes not approved for human use. To support clinical high-precision imaging, we propose a NIR-II fluorescence enhanced imaging method based on perception-enhanced spectrum shift generative adversarial network with explainable AI systems (xAI-PSSGAN). The proposed method tackles the problem of limited unpaired data training, and generates NIR-IIb resembling images with enhanced resolution and reduced noise. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed method effectively improves the imaging quality and surpasses competing alternatives, which is of great significance to promote the high-quality NIR-II imaging in clinical practice.},

  abstract={The integration of music and video is a pivotal aspect of creating impactful advertisements. This study explores the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in generating music tailored for video advertisements through a system we developed, named Ourmuse. By leveraging advanced Generative AI models, Ourmuse aims to enhance the synchronization between music and video content. The methodology involves extracting and analyzing still images and texture context from the video. A critical aspect of our approach is the plot-based training of the AI model by identifying transition points between video scenes, where the video is segmented into distinct parts rather than being treated as a single unit. This segmentation ensures that Ourmuse produces music that is coherent and contextually appropriate for each segment, enhancing the overall impact and cohesion of the final advertisement. By focusing on multi-modal inputs and plot-specific training, this research aims to develop a robust AI model capable of revolutionizing the music composition process for video advertisements.},

While GAI has been in effect for the past decade, the introduction of ChatGPT sparked a new wave of research and innovation in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain. This surge has led to the development and release of numerous cutting-edge tools, such as Bard, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Make-A-Video, Runway ML, and Jukebox, among others. These tools exhibit remarkable capabilities, encompassing tasks ranging from text generation and music composition, image creation, video production, code generation, and even scientific work. They are built upon various state-of-the-art models, including Stable Diffusion, transformer models like GPT-3 (recent GPT-4), variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. This advancement in GAI presents a wealth of exciting opportunities across various sectors, such as business, healthcare, education, entertainment, and media. However, concurrently, it poses unprecedented challenges such as impersonation, job displacement, privacy breaches, security vulnerabilities, and misinformation. To addressing these challenges requires a new direction for research to develop solutions and refine existing products. In our endeavor to contribute profound insights to society and advance research on GAI, we present a comprehensive journal which explores the theoretical and mathematical foundations of GAI state-of-the-art models, exploring the diverse spectrum of tasks they can perform, examining the challenges they entail, and discussing the promising prospects for the future of GAI.},

  abstract={With the prevalence of generational artificial intelligence (AI) in everyday life, there has been a recent increase in research on individuals' perceptions and attitudes towards generational AI. However, with the breadth of use cases and applications made available with the advancements in large language models (LLMs), there are increasing signs that attitudes towards LLM-based generative AI may be context or use-case dependent. We examine the contextualised trust of individuals in AI, the support for using AI, and AI adoption intentions in a survey experiment ($\mathrm{N}=306$) across three contexts (reasons): technical, mental health, and creative assistance. Participants read ostensible news articles about AI use in one of these three contexts, and completed a survey on their resultant and previous attitudes. The results show that trust and adoption were significantly higher for technical assistance, and lower for creative assistance and mental health assistance. However, support for using AI for mental health assistance was significantly higher than creative assistance, and comparable to technical assistance. Contextualised trust and support also significantly predicted AI adoption intentions, above and beyond trust scores towards AI in general. Our study suggests that contextualised attitudes towards specific AI products appear to be sufficiently differentiated from (general) AI attitudes, and instances where AI is used for technical reasons, as opposed to creative or mental health reasons, garners more favourable attitudes.},

  abstract={Satellite communication offers the prospect of service continuity over uncovered and under-covered areas, service ubiquity, and service scalability. However, several challenges must first be addressed to realize these benefits, as the resource management, network control, network security, spectrum management, and energy usage of satellite networks are more challenging than that of terrestrial networks. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, has been steadily growing as a research field and has shown successful results in diverse applications, including wireless communication. In particular, the application of AI to a wide variety of satellite communication aspects has demonstrated excellent potential, including beam-hopping, anti-jamming, network traffic forecasting, channel modeling, telemetry mining, ionospheric scintillation detecting, interference managing, remote sensing, behavior modeling, space-air-ground integrating, and energy managing. This work thus provides a general overview of AI, its diverse sub-fields, and its state-of-the-art algorithms. Several challenges facing diverse aspects of satellite communication systems are then discussed, and their proposed and potential AI-based solutions are presented. Finally, an outlook of field is drawn, and future steps are suggested.},

  abstract={The integration of gamification in educational settings has shown promise in enhancing student engagement and learning outcomes. However, educators often face significant challenges in designing and implementing effective gamification strategies due to lack of expertise, time constraints, and limited resources. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) to assist educators in creating engaging gamified learning experiences. The AI-Assisted Gamification Framework aims to simplify the process of designing, implementing, and evaluating gamification solutions across various educational domains, addressing common challenges faced by educators such as lack of expertise and resource constraints. To demonstrate its practical application, the paper presents a case study based on a first-year university business analysis course. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive prompting guide with sample AI prompts for each stage of the gamification design process. The research discusses potential benefits of the framework, including time efficiency, enhanced creativity, and improved scalability, while also addressing challenges such as the need for AI literacy among educators and ethical considerations. This structured methodology empowers educators to create impactful gamification experiences with AI assistance, potentially enhancing student engagement and learning outcomes while overcoming common implementation barriers in educational gamification.},

  abstract={In the rapidly evolving domain of healthcare, the availability of large and diverse datasets is paramount for the development and validation of advanced algorithms. However, the acquisition of such data is often hindered by privacy concerns, limited patient cohorts, and the inherent variability in medical conditions. This research delves into the potential of Deep Generative Models (DGMs) as a solution for synthetic data generation in healthcare applications. We present a comprehensive study of various DGM architectures, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Normalizing Flows, and their efficacy in generating high-fidelity medical images. Our experiments demonstrate that these models can produce synthetic data that retains the intricate features of real medical images while ensuring patient privacy. Furthermore, when used as augmentation in training diagnostic algorithms, the synthetic data generated by our proposed models showed a significant improvement in the generalization capabilities of these algorithms. This work not only underscores the potential of DGMs in addressing the data scarcity issue in healthcare but also paves the way for their broader application in medical research, training, and diagnostics.},

  abstract={Establishing endogenous intelligence capabilities within telecommunication networks in the form of native artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a significant topic of research for promoting the prospects of 6th Generation (6G) networks. In the upcoming 6G era, the network is expected to provide services for building and deploying distributed AI applications in the network infrastructure, and such applications will be used solely by the network or offered to operators or third parties as new services. This paper begins by analysing the current status of standardisation in the network AI domain, and next elaborates on the major shortcomings of the current approaches for natively setting up network AI services. On this basis, we present the concept of Native Network Generative AI (NNGAI), which builds on and further advances the concept of native AI for telecom networks. To formulate the paradigm of NNGAI, we first devise the network architecture, and then finally the underlying logical flow of network services to realize NNGAI by carefully inserting generative AI technologies into both the architecture and the service flow of 6G networks.},

  abstract={The increasing integration of ChatGPT, a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) model, into educational environments has sparked substantial ethical concerns. This paper addresses the crucial question of whether to impose restrictions or legislate the usage of Gen-AI, with ChatGPT as a pivotal case study. Through systematic literature review and frequency of occurrence analysis, 10 ethical concerns were selected for further analysis using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The analysis responses of 10 expert panels show that the top concerns, as revealed by their weights, after meeting the consistency requirement, include copyright, legal, and compliance issues (0.1731), privacy and confidentiality (0.1286), academic integrity (0.1206), incorrect reference and citation practices (0.1111), and safety and security concerns (0.1050). Evaluating the impact of these concerns on the policy alternatives (restriction and legislation), the findings revealed that “Restriction” received a higher weight (0.513712) compared to “Legislation” (0.485887). Notably, copyright, legal, and compliance issues, privacy and confidentiality, and academic integrity emerged as crucial factors influencing the decision between restriction and legislation. This study offers valuable insights for educational institutions and policymakers, suggesting the need for inclusive discussions, pilot programs to assess impacts on critical thinking, development of clear guidelines, flexible regulatory frameworks, awareness campaigns, and potential strategies for ethical and responsible use.},

Existing scientific systems, referred to as Centralized Science (CeSci), are built on centralized organizational structures and top-down institutional frameworks, which are lagging behind the development and practical requirements of AI4S. To address these limitations, AI4S needs to embrace a new scientific organizational and operational paradigm, namely Decentralized Science (DeSci). It can provide strong support to AI4S via effectively addressing issues such as information silos, biases, unfair distribution, and monopolies and promoting multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and trans disciplinary cooperation in science. Based on these considerations, this paper presents the framework of AI4S based on DeSci and explores its potential application scenarios and research issues.

  abstract={Interest has been growing over the past number of years in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to aid in cancer diagnosis. However, the requirement for extensive training data to train these AI models presents a significant challenge. This paper proposes a viable solution to this issue by synthesising images to augment the real data in the training dataset. We investigate the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in generating high-quality tissue images for both colon and prostate. The datasets we use are from the TCGA repository and contain various cancerous diseases for both colon and prostate. We outline how the data was pre-processed, and quality controlled and we also delineate the relevant experiments applied. We apply some of the most recent GAN architectures in ProGAN and StyleGAN to generate synthetic colon tissue images, achieving a literature-high Fréchet Inception Score (FID) score of 6.019 for colon tissue images and an FID score of 3.03 for prostate tissue images. Notably, the synthetic images produced were deemed indistinguishable from real samples when assessed by a practicing consultant histopathologist. By addressing the challenge of limited training data, our approach could ultimately contribute to earlier detection and improved treatment outcomes for cancer patients worldwide.},

  abstract={The increasing number of international students (IS) enrolled in Australian higher education institutions, combined with the widespread adoption of online and hybrid learning, has significant implications for understanding the factors that influence engagement among this diverse student group. Early identification of students with low engagement facilitates academic success, prevents poor outcomes, optimizes resource allocation, improves teaching strategies, increases motivation, and supports long-term success. This study's main aim is to examine the use of AI to predict student engagement. Development of a theoretically informed survey that aimed to elicit postgraduate students' engagement was developed and validated by expert judgment. In total, 200 copies of the survey were distributed, 121 responses were received, and 96 were considered for this study representing a response rate of 48%. This study promotes a multidimensional approach, utilizing AI and ML methodologies, to determine the influence of social and cultural contexts on student engagement. This approach enables educators and institutions to create effective strategies for enhancing the learning experience of postgraduate students. Multiple AI and ML techniques have been utilized including synthetic data generation methods such GaussianCopula, triplet-based variational autoencoder, generative adversarial networks, CopulaGAN, and conditional tabular generative adversarial network. These techniques are specifically employed to predict various dimensions of engagement, including personal, academic, intellectual, social, and professional engagement. The performance of AI/ML algorithms, including support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, gradient boosting machine, random forest, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and extra trees, was assessed using several metrics including F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrix, and accuracy. The models used in this study achieved up to 85% accuracy, offering a solid foundation for guidelines and support to enhance decision making processes in higher education. These findings provide valuable insights for both academics and policy makers, laying the groundwork for evidence-based strategies to improve student engagement.},

This paper introduces an innovative framework leveraging AI to address the complex demands of SoSE. The framework itself has been developed using a systematic domain analysis method. The framework incorporates a metamodel, a Matrix Chart for aligning AI technologies with specific SoS capabilities, and a systematic method for their application across different stages of the SoS lifecycle. To validate our framework, we employ a multi-case study methodology, examining diverse SoS examples across industries.

  abstract={The generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models, renowned for generating human-like text, occasionally produce “hallucinations”—outputs that diverge from human expectations. Current mitigation strategies for these GPT hallucinations largely rely on algorithmic automation, thereby overlooking the complexities of human judgment and cultural influence, particularly in fact interpretation. Addressing this issue, we have introduced a Culturally Sensitive Test that integrates language subjectivity, cultural nuances, and GPT idiosyncrasies. We have applied this test to five GPT models—OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, Google's Bard, Perplexity AI, and TruthGPT—evaluating their responses to 70 questions across seven categories designed to provoke hallucinations. The evaluated models demonstrated varying performance, with controversial topics, those lacking clear scientific consensus and the brain teasers proving more susceptible to GPT hallucinations. Our study has paved the way for a nuanced assessment of GPT hallucinations.},

Currently, there are problems such as low content production efficiency, inaccurate personalized recommendations and poor user experience. This study aims to improve the generation and optimization of digital media content through artificial intelligence technology. First, high-caliber multimedia content is produced through the utilization of generative adversarial networks (GAN) and variational autoencoders (VAE); secondly, content recommendation algorithms are optimized through reinforcement learning, and personalized recommendations are made based on user behavior data; finally, to assess and enhance content quality, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The proposed method only takes 1.3 seconds to generate 800 words of content, and the highest recommendation accuracy is 98%.

The key challenges in COVID-19 mitigation include effective immunization, treatment, and adaptable containment techniques. The promise of artificial intelligence (AI) in COVID-19 tracking, diagnostics and prognosis, medication discovery, vaccine development, and therapy of COVID-19 surveillance is the subject of this chapter. AI attempts to emulate the cognitive powers of the human brain, such as problem-solving and learning capacities, using massive data. Machine learning (ML), a subtype of AI, has particular potential in solving issues based on data-curated experiences. Advances in AI approaches have offered a previously unheard-of potential for constructing agile surveillance systems based on a flood of data gathered in a short period of time. Many publications during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of AI techniques in prioritizing, distribution, surveillance, medications, vaccines, and nonpharmaceutical therapies. This review will go over the clinical efficacy of AI-based models as well as the constraints and problems that AI systems face, such as model generalizability, explainability, and trust, which act as pillars for real-world deployment in healthcare.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has revolutionized higher education with features like instant feedback, resource and material creation, adaptive learning, interactivity, and more. However, GAI also brings with it a number of serious challenges that raise ethical and moral concerns regarding academic integrity. To carry out this transition process, it will be necessary to develop clear guidelines that adhere to integrity standards and ethical codes of higher education institutions. In addition to offering responses to a number of research questions, the purpose of this study is to further the current discourse surrounding the moral guidelines for GAI in higher education. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) technique and Bibliometric Analysis using VOSviewer, 37 related research studies were reviewed and evaluated. The results demonstrate that the number of articles published has been increasing over time, with the largest number of scientific publications occurring in 2024. This can be explained by the fact that, despite the fact that GAI offers benefits and drawbacks for the educational sector, particularly for higher education, it also makes clear how important it is for professionals and organizations to use GAI tools in order to handle ethical issues by continuously developing policies. By creating norms and policies, future ethical problems with GAI in education may be more accurately predicted. The engagement and dedication of academic experts and other relevant stakeholders are essential to achieving this goal of increasing public awareness and effectively utilizing GAI technology.},

  abstract={The rapid evolution of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational landscapes., particularly in computer science education. This study investigates research trends in generative AI applications through text network and topic modeling analyses. A comprehensive literature review across IEEE Xplore., Scopus., and Web of Science identified 151 studies published between 2023 and 2024. Text network analysis revealed that “AI.,” “student.,” “education.,” “learning.,” and “performance” were the most frequently occurring terms., highlighting key research themes. Ego-network analysis demonstrated strong interconnectivity between educational AI tools and student learning outcomes. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)., four major research topics emerged: educational chatbots (35.1 %)., AI literacy (25.8%)., exam performance (21.8%)., and technology integration (17.2%). Findings indicate a dominant focus on chatbots for student engagement., while ethical concerns and multimodal AI applications remain underexplored. The study underscores the necessity of addressing AI literacy gaps and enhancing interdisciplinary AI integration in educational settings. Despite its potential., generative AI adoption is hindered by privacy risks., uneven technological access., and the lack of standardized policies. Future research should focus on ethical AI frameworks., multimodal AI tools., and long-term learning outcomes. This study provides a data-driven foundation for understanding the evolving role of generative AI in education and its implications for educators., policymakers., and researchers.},

  abstract={AI Art Generators have recently developed in such a way that they have become accessible to everyone who has access to the internet. This paper looks into how the modern AI art generators work and identifies the various issues with AI art on technical, moral and legal grounds. Furthermore it aims to understands how the increased accessibility to AI art generators affects humans.Modern AI art generators use artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms and deep neural network algorithms to study a large amount of pre-existing artworks in portfolio and produce new art based on the prompts provided by the user. They use software such as CNN, GAN, NST.The biggest argument against AI art is that it needs the human creativity and imagination. But it has been argued that the human creativity is included in the text prompts provided by the artist. AI art generators have also been accused of stealing art works without permission of the artists which has been leading to some copyright issues. Furthermore AI art generators have been stealing artists’ commissions and work. AI art generators are not perfect yet and have several errors such as errors in the art generated such as anatomy errors(example: hands with six fingers instead of five etc). Artists have protested against the use of AI art generators. One such protest is the "No to AI generated images" movement wherein they flooded the portfolio in an AI art generator called "ArtStation" with images tagged as "trending in ArtStation in order to render all the generated images useless.},

  abstract={Generative AI transforms education by making learning experiences better and more personalized. GAI overcomes some of the problems in traditional teaching by providing tools like ChatGPT and GANs, which create smart learning systems, design instructional materials, and provide interactive, engaging experiences. GAI is the key to supporting educators to automate resources, provide personal content, and focus on creativity and critical thinking. Its size of growth and adaptability can fill in any kind of knowledge gap, specifically in distressful regions for applications related to skill development, translation of languages, medical learning, and virtual teaching. Interoperability with VR and the metaverse modernizes education further. The issues in this are data collection, biases in algorithms, and the human interaction is reduced. That would require explainable algorithms and robust data protection. Policymakers, educators, and technologists must be in a joint effort to see that GAI is used justly. Democratized education, lifelong learning, and inclusive future promises GAI as they blend technology with pedagogy to reap maximum benefits and risks.},

  abstract={The paper is dedicated to the philosophical analysis of the specifics of artificial intelligence and its relation to human intelligence, as well as of the very notion of generative artificial intelligence and its abilities and inabilities. Emphasis is placed on such feature of human thinking as openness, which is argued to clearly distinguish it from machine thinking, as well as on such aspects of human intelligence as nonlinearity, morality, emotionality and evaluation that could be described as extra-rational and thus unobtainable for the artificial intelligence. It is argued that artificial intelligence cannot think openly, “out of the box”, going beyond the boundaries of purely rational reasoning and formal logic peculiar to classical type of rationality. The authors also conclude that the development of AI-based technologies makes it necessary to shift the higher education in the direction of strengthening the emphasis on the ethical, emotional, and volitional sphere of human intelligence.},

  abstract={Mental disorders show a rapid increase and cause considerable harm to individuals as well as the society in recent decade. Hence, mental disorders have become a serious public health challenge in nowadays society. Timely treatment of mental disorders plays a critical role for reducing the harm of mental illness to individuals and society. Music therapy is a type of non-pharmaceutical method in treating such mental disorders. However, conventional music therapy suffers from a number of issues resulting in a lack of popularity. Thanks to the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially the AI Generated Content (AIGC), it provides a chance to address these issues. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work investigating music therapy from AIGC and closed-loop perspective. In this paper, we summarise some universal music therapy methods and discuss their shortages. Then, we indicate some AIGC techniques, especially the music generation, for their application in music therapy. Moreover, we present a closed-loop music therapy system and introduce its implementation details. Finally, we discuss some challenges in AIGC-based music therapy with proposing further research direction, and we suggest the potential of this system to become a consumer-grade product for treating mental disorders.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize all aspects of business, particularly new-product development (NPD). Currently, our approach to NPD has remained largely unchanged for decades, yielding stubbornly poor results: only 30% of NP development projects become commercial successes. However, the AI revolution is set to alter this landscape significantly! Leading early adopter firms demonstrate that AI not only finds many applications in NPD but also offers substantial payoffs, such as 50% reductions in development times. This article provides an outline of the diverse and powerful applications of AI in NPD, offering numerous examples from leading companies. Examples include GE's use of digital models and twins to quickly test product designs in turbine development; BASFs use of AI to identify new molecules for use in customer formulations; and AI to generate new-product ideas, identify new-product opportunities, and even create new-product concepts. Our exploratory journey begins at the idea stage and traverses the entire new-product process to the postlaunch period. While AI might still resemble science fiction to many, that future is no longer fiction—it is here now. AI has arrived in full force! With an adoption window of about 13 years, the time is now to embrace AI in NPD in your business. AI will become a major milestone in NPD, perhaps the most important, within the decade.},

  abstract={Virtual patient (VP) avatars driven by artificial intelligence (AI) could enhance healthcare training and offer flexible learning. Recent advances have developed large language models (LLMs) for more natural and contextual responses, but research into LLMs for VPs is still emerging. This research aimed to co-create prompts and training for a conversational AI system supporting a VP. The objective was to pilot the processes of prompt engineering and AI training in line with iterative development and human-centred design (HCD). Co-creation underpinned by design thinking was employed, involving collaboration between the university as User Experience designers and industry AI Engineers. Fifty-nine participants from student, academic, clinical, and technology groups were recruited for six co-creation workshops. Four versions of the VP prompts were developed and tested, with nine training samples included in the reinforcement fine tuning data set. This research adopts an HCD approach, outlining various techniques for co-creating optimal prompts that consider the VP's personality, life context and clinical situation. A definition of VPs as it relates to human-centred AI (HCAI) development and a framework for the process is discussed.},

  abstract={Social Media Systems such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter (i.e., X) are exploding. These systems need proper governance so that the users are safe and post accurate information. This paper focuses on social media governance with an emphasis on Artificial Intelligence. First, we discuss various aspects of governance of such policies, procedures and risk and then address a key topic which is detecting fake news on social media. In order for the users to be safe using social media we have to ensure that the governance aspects also include fake news detection. Many of the fake news detection techniques utilize Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and more recently Generative AI (GenAI) techniques. Therefore, the AI systems that implement the various techniques have to be trustworthy. That means these systems have to be secure as well as ensure fairness, privacy and integrity. Therefore, the paper will also discuss AI Governance as an integral part of Social Media Governance. Finally, to support the various applications and frameworks, both data and the cloud are critical. Large amounts of data are stored and managed by the social media systems as well as used to train the AI models. Furthermore, we need massive amounts of computing power that can be provided by the cloud. Therefore, we will also discuss data and cloud governance that provides the infrastructure for social media and AI governance.},

  abstract={Fields such as machine learning and artificial intelligence are proven business enablers, we have several use cases in the field of technology from basic implementations such as automated scanners, and weak forms such as Alexa and Siri that have paved the way for further development. Search for more avenues of investment in this field continues till date. It’s also evident that researchers and organizations have barely scratched the surface in terms of exploring and using AI (Artificial intelligence) as a technology. Theoretical forms of AI have not yet been implemented. This paper aims to provide some context around the various forms of AI currently used and can be explored in the near future. It’s important to be mindful that, with the use of any technology, even AI, there are challenges, regulations, and security risks that tag along. Firms need to pay close attention to the macro factors that could impact the adoption and AI in their respective businesses. This study aims to provide a brief overview of the aforementioned road blocks that could impact AI adoption, however, there are some solution strategies or approaches that could help firms along the way to overcome those road blocks. These strategies might take time to build and take effect but they will be beneficial in the long run and thus help with not only sustainable implementation, but also complete and successful adoption of AI as a technology enabler.},

  abstract={Proper artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) model implementation and training are highly reliant on quality input data. However, the high costs of clinical studies and increasing privacy concerns limit the availability of medical data to researchers. This work explores the potential of applying generative adversarial networks (GAN) for generating synthetic medical data based on publicly available real-world datasets. Synthetic data is generated based on real-world observations and used to train several contemporary ML and AI models. These models are subjected to comparison with models trained on real data. Both trained models are evaluated under identical conditions on real-world testing data. These well-known, high-quality datasets are explored in this study covering diabetes and heart disease. While models trained on synthetic data show a slight decrease in objective performance, they still demonstrate viably accurate outcomes. This suggests that the introduced approach presents a potential stepping stone towards improvising data availability for researchers while respecting patients’ best interests and patient privacy.},

  abstract={The rapid development of artificial intelligence has made an increase in the amount of generated content around the globe. Art is the most threatened field due to AI, potentially affecting the market value of an artist's creation. These generated images also affect artists who rely on their work for income as the accessibility of these models diminishes the demand for hiring real artists. As these generative models continue to evolve, it is becoming more difficult to differentiate between authentic art and generated ones. This paper addresses the need for a tool that can accurately distinguish between human-made and AI-generated artworks using a convolutional neural network (CNN) known as EfficientNetV2, ResNet50, and VGGNet. Our methodology involves using a dataset comprising images created by both human artists and AI algorithms. This aim of developing this tool is to preserve the integrity of human-made art while also protecting artists' rights and sustaining the value of art in the market. The researched produce a satisfying result with EfficientNetV2 achieving 98.7% accuracy, ResNet50 achieving 98.5% accuracy and VGG16 achieves 97.4% accuracy. This solves our problem of identifying AI-generated artworks as artists can rest assure their integrity and originality of their work can be recognize by using this model.},

  abstract={Generative adversarial network is a popular deep learning technique for solving artificial intelligence tasks, and it has been widely studied and applied for processing images, voices, texts and so on. Especially, generative adversarial network is adopted in the field of image processing, such as image style transfer, image restoration, image super-resolution and so on. Although generative adversarial networks show remarkable success in image generation, training process is usually unstable and trained models collapse where many of the generated images may contain the same color or texture pattern. In this paper, the network of generator and discriminator are modified, and the residual block is added to the generative adversarial network architecture to learn better image features. To reduce the loss of image feature during training and get more features to stabilize image generation, we use feature matching to minimize feature loss between the real and generated images for stable training. In the experiment, performance improvement can be obtained by adopting our proposed method, which is also better than some state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Modern Chatbots represent a significant advancement in human-computer interaction by integrating emotional intelligence into their design. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely on predefined rules and keyword recognition, these advanced systems use affective computing and sentiment analysis to understand and respond to user’s emotional states. By using large LLMs, this innovation brings several key benefits. It enhances efficiency by providing immediate, relevant answers without users needing to search through multiple sources. The chatbot delivers precise information tailored to the emotional context of the interaction. Additionally, these chatbots offer greater convenience by consolidating information into a single query, streamlining the user experience and reducing the need to navigate through various platforms. They have improved so much yet are so much limited. An emotion sensitive chatbots should recognize and respond to emotional cues, fostering a deeper connection with users, encouraging regular interaction, creating a more interactive and personalized experience while also offering valuable insights into user behavior and preferences, enabling organizations to refine their marketing strategies and product development efforts. Overall, emotion-based chatbots should bridge the gap for human digital interactions.

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly reshaping creative domains, offering new tools for the preservation and reinterpretation of traditional art. This paper examines how generative AI models, specifically CycleGAN and StyleGAN2, interact with Indian folk-art forms such as Madhubani, Warli, Pichwai, and Chamba. These culturally rich art traditions are not just visual expressions but living embodiments of heritage and identity. We implement a mixed-methods approach that integrates deep learning architectures with cultural evaluation to investigate the symbolic accuracy, emotional resonance, and perceptual authenticity of AI-generated artworks. Through technical benchmarking and perceptual surveys involving artisans, designers, and cultural scholars, we identify a nuanced divide: while AI excels at stylistic mimicry, it often fails to capture the emotional depth and symbolic nuances inherent in traditional art. Our findings underscore the dual potential and peril of using AI in cultural preservation—highlighting its usefulness for educational outreach and digital restoration, while also cautioning against the risks of cultural misrepresentation. We advocate for ethically guided, culturally aware AI systems that collaborate with—not replace—human creativity, ensuring respectful engagement with intangible heritage in the digital age.},
