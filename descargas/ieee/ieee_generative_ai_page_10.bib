  abstract={Human emotion synthesis is a crucial aspect of affective computing. It involves using computational methods to mimic and convey human emotions through various modalities, with the goal of enabling more natural and effective human-computer interactions. Recent advancements in generative models, such as Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, Diffusion Models, Large Language Models, and Sequence-to-Sequence Models, have significantly contributed to the development of this field. However, there is a notable lack of comprehensive reviews in this field. To address this problem, this paper aims to address this gap by providing a thorough and systematic overview of recent advancements in human emotion synthesis based on generative models. Specifically, this review will first present the review methodology, the emotion models involved, the mathematical principles of generative models, and the datasets used. Then, the review covers the application of different generative models to emotion synthesis based on a variety of modalities, including facial images, speech, and text. It also examines mainstream evaluation metrics. Additionally, the review presents some major findings and suggests future research directions, providing a comprehensive understanding of the role of generative technology in the nuanced domain of emotion synthesis.},

  abstract={The last year, we have witnessed the popularization of generative artificial intelligence. Its output includes text, code, image, audio, speech, voice, music, and video. Therefore, it impacts education courses where students are required to elaborate on any of these artifacts. In particular, the generation of code affects informatics courses, where assignments usually ask students to develop and deliver programming code. The impact of generative artificial intelligence on informatics courses has been mainly studied for introductory programming courses. These studies have shown that generative artificial intelligence is able to produce highly sophisticated programs, but also that its results and rationale can be inaccurate. Moreover, the impact of generative artificial intelligence has not been studied for other informatics subjects. In this paper, we present our preliminary experience and proposals on three advanced software courses, namely video games, advanced algorithms and language processors. For the video games course, we present the opportunities of use of generative artificial intelligence and the results of a survey conducted with students on their use to obtain different media products. For the algorithms course, we present the result of a session driven by the instructor on different design techniques, showing the merits and demerits of the answers generated. For the language processors course, a proposal of use of generative artificial intelligence is presented, broken down into the parts of a typical language processor. The paper concludes with some suggestions for instructors.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technologies have deeply changed people's daily lives. There are many AI-based applications used in industrial scenarios such as Internet of Things (IoT), smart grids, and edge computing. Although bringing AI into industrial scenarios could improve the performance in many aspects, new security and privacy issues are also introduced consequently. Subsequently, machine learning technologies require a training process which introduces the protection problems in the training data and algorithms. As many machine learning and deep learning models are vulnerable against well-designed adversarial input samples, outsourcing data and algorithms for training will require the integrity of the training data. Also, data privacy of the end users must be protected. On the other hand, traditional solutions for industrial system security could also be enhanced by these AI schemes. The papers in this special section focus on emerging privacy and security issues brought by Artificial Intelligence in industrial informatics.},

  abstract={With the intensification of conflicts in different regions, the W-band suspicious object detection system is an essential security means to prevent terrorist attacks and is widely used in many crucial places such as airports. Because artificial intelligence can perform highly reliable and accurate services in the field of image recognition, it is used in suspicious object detection systems to increase the recognition rate for suspicious objects. However, it is challenging to establish a complete suspicious object database, and obtaining sufficient millimeter-wave images of suspicious objects from experiments for AI training is not realistic. To address this issue, this paper verifies the feasibility to generate a large number of millimeter-wave images for AI training by generative adversarial networks. Moreover, we also evaluate the factors that affect the AI recognition rate when the original images used for CNN training are insufficient and how to increase the service quality of AI-based W-band suspicious object detection systems for moving persons. In parallel, all the international standardization organizations have been collectively advancing the novel technologies of AI. We update the reader with information about AI research and standardization related activities in this paper.},

  abstract={SAR image simulation plays an important role in the process of SAR target interpretation and recognition, especially when the number of SAR images is limited. Due to the restriction of acquisition process, the numbers of SAR target images are always insufficient. The traditional SAR image simulation, which is based on calculation of electromagnetic theory, is easily to be affected by parameter distortion due to the lack of joint optimization. Consequently, it makes a big effect on the quality of the simulated images. This paper presents a novel approach, end-to-end models, to simulate the desired images from the SAR image database. A series of generative adversarial networks include DCGAN, weight clipping WGAN and WGAN with gradient penalty are optimized and applied to generate typical SAR target images. Three kinds of network structures are used, include structure of DCGAN, newly proposed structure of four residual blocks networks and Resnet. Experimental results show that the proposed novel method is not only efficient for SAR image simulation, but also can generate excellent SAR images. Furthermore, we analysis the results and the characteristics of different networks, which pave a good way for SAR image simulation based on artificial intelligence method.},

  abstract={Teachers' role has evolved over the years in line with the timeline of industrial revolution of the modern world. The period of profound economic and technological change shaped the perception of society on the role of teachers as educators. From the first industrial revolution where we see mass production and growth in factories to the current fourth industrial revolution where we see the integration of artificial intelligence into our everyday living, the role of teachers has also evolved from one who delivers content knowledge to one who designs for learning and champions technology adoption in the classroom. The evolution of teachers' role demands that teachers be able to adapt to changes and equip themselves with relevant knowledge and skills to carry out their roles to the basic expectation of the modern society, and this includes equipping themselves with the knowledge and skills in navigating the highly pervasive educational technology used in classroom today, post pandemic, the Generative AI (Gen AI). Teachers are expected to have the digital competence to effectively create a conducive personalized learning environment for the students. This paper will explore how teachers' perception of their role in this era of Gen AI, influence their use of Gen AI in the classroom.},

  abstract={<p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. AI technologies attempt to mimic human intelligence in nontraditional computing tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and translation. The goal of Prompt Engineering is to maximize the performance of an AI model by providing inputs that leverage its capabilities effectively. It's a skill that combines creativity with an understanding of how AI systems process information. It's particularly relevant for Generative AI models where the input directly shapes the creation of new content, whether it be writing a poem, composing music, coding a software function, or generating a visual image. Generative AI powers conversational assistants that offer tailored financial guidance to users based on their financial behavior and goals.

  abstract={This study presents the results of an analysis on the perception of secondary education teachers in the Dominican Republic regarding the use of emerging technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), in their classroom practices. It also identifies the barriers and ethical risks associated with their integration. An online survey was administered to a sample of 754 teachers, using a questionnaire validated by expert judgment and with high reliability ${(\alpha=0.941)}$. The results showed a high level of adoption of technological tools, with the most commonly used being Quizizz, ChatGPT, Padlet, and Kahoot!. Gamification was perceived as the tool with the greatest benefits for student learning and motivation, while generative AI text raised concerns about its potential negative impact on cognitive development. The lack of access to equipment and resources, as well as the need for teacher training, were identified as the main barriers to implementation. Additionally, ethical concerns related to data privacy and security, especially in the case of generative AI text, were evident. The findings suggest the need for further reflection and discussion on the ethical risks of these technologies within the educational community, as well as the design of policies and teacher training programs that promote their effective and responsible use.},

  abstract={This work introduces House Plan AI, an AI system that generates 2D house plans automatically from user-specified requirements like room types, spatial relationships, and dimensions. T5 and LLaMA models are used to process natural language inputs, and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is used to manage the spatial layout of rooms. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) produces realistic floor plan images from structured data. The dataset used contains 1500 house plans based on AutoCAD, which were preprocessed by confirming dimensions, eliminating unwanted objects such as furniture, converting to JPG, and resizing to 512×512 via a padding technique. One of the significant features of the system is that it has a cost estimation module in which the Gemini API is employed for the extraction of text and dimension data from uploaded house plans. This information is then utilized to estimate the cost of construction, including items such as steel, RCC belts, rubble work, and fittings, and the results are displayed via a graphical split of costs. A Streamlit-based user interface facilitates login support for users, contractors, and dealers so that they can generate and download plans, see estimates of costs, and allocate work based on reviews. The suggested solution cuts down substantially the time and expense involved in conventional architectural processes, providing a cost-effective, scalable platform for custom home design.},

  pages={760-765},
  abstract={This paper aims to explore the application of computer artificial intelligence technology in the field of visual communication design, especially the research and development of intelligent poster generation system. We propose an innovative algorithm that integrates the benefits of variational autoencoders (VAE) and generative adversarial networks (Gans) to enable more efficient and flexible poster design generation. As a powerful generative model, variational autoencoders can generate new samples by learning potential representations of data. The generative adversarial network, with its excellent generative ability and adversarial training mechanism, has made remarkable achievements in the field of image generation. By integrating the two, we have built an intelligent system capable of capturing complex features of poster designs and producing diverse, high-quality posters. In the algorithm implementation, we use variational autoencoder to encode the poster design data and extract the potential feature representation. These features are then fed into a generator in the generative adversarial network to generate a new poster design through adversarial training. At the same time, we designed an efficient loss function to balance the diversity and authenticity of the generated posters. The experimental results show that the algorithm has excellent performance in poster design generation. It can not only generate creative and personalized posters, but also customize the design according to user needs. In addition, the algorithm also shows good generalization ability when dealing with different styles and themes of poster design. In the future, we will continue to optimize algorithms, explore more application scenarios, and promote the deep integration of computer artificial intelligence and visual communication design.},

This work comprehensively explores the intrinsic interaction between simulation and AI in DTs, meticulously covering the current literature status and categorizing these symbiotic interactions into three different groups that cover AI to support DT-based simulation, AI for optimization of simulation within DT, and simulation to support AI approaches in DT. In addition, a deeper look is taken at the role of simulation and $A I$ in the emerging concept of the Industrial Metaverse, which promises to extend DTs beyond discrete virtual representation of physical systems to encompass the industrial ecosystem from end-to-end. Finally, the main research challenges for achieving the full integration of simulation and AI in DTs and at the Industrial Metaverse are discussed.},

  abstract={Aiming at the problems such as insufficient brightness, blurred details and severe color cast of transmission line images in the power system, a multi-scale adaptive enhancement algorithm for transmission line images based on Retinex theory is proposed. Based on the traditional multi-scale Retinex algorithm, this algorithm introduces adaptive gamma correction to adjust brightness and color balance, achieving adaptive distribution of multi-scale weights. The experimental results show that compared with the classical multi-scale Retinex algorithm, the algorithm proposed in this paper has improved to varying degrees in multiple evaluation indicators, and the average processing time of the algorithm is also better than that of similar classical algorithms. Qualitative analysis further verified the significant effect of this algorithm in detail retention and color restoration. This method demonstrates excellent performance in both image enhancement quality and efficiency, and has high potential for engineering application.},

  abstract={This review examines the ethical, social, and technical challenges posed by AI-generated text tools, focusing on their rapid advancement and widespread adoption. An exhaustive literature search across many databases, strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, and a rigorous analysis procedure are all parts of our systematic review technique. This guarantees an impartial and complete study of the current status of AI-generated text tools. The study analyzes prominent language models, including GPT-3, GPT-4, LaMDA, PaLM, Claude, Jasper, and Llama 2, evaluating their capabilities in natural language processing and generation. The analysis reveals significant advancements, with GPT-3 demonstrating a 92% accuracy rate on standard natural language understanding benchmarks, outperforming LaMDA (88%) and PaLM (85%). To illustrate real-world implications, the review presents a case study of ChatGPT’s application in healthcare, where it achieved 80% consistency with expert opinions in assessing acute ulcerative colitis. This case highlights both the potential benefits and ethical concerns of AI in critical domains. Quantitative bias analysis shows that GPT-3 generated biased content in 15% of test cases involving sensitive topics, a higher rate than LaMDA (12%) and PaLM (10%). We provide an in-depth analysis of fairness and bias issues, particularly in image generation tasks depicting professional roles. Our research synthesizes insights from technical advancements, ethical considerations, and real-world applications across healthcare, education, and creative sectors. We address critical privacy concerns and data protection challenges, noting struggles in AI-generated text detection and investigating AI’s potential in enabling cyberattacks. We underscore the need for comprehensive governance systems and multidisciplinary cooperation. To provide a cohesive analysis of the ethical considerations surrounding AI-generated text tools, we employ a multifaceted ethical framework drawing on established theories. Utilitarianism, which seeks to maximize happiness for everyone; deontology, which places an emphasis on right and wrong; and Virtue Ethics, which analyzes the moral nature of deeds and actors, are all included in this framework. In this article, we use this approach to investigate AI ethics from a variety of angles, including privacy, prejudice, and social implications, as well as concerns of justice and fairness. Moreover, the study critically examines existing and proposed legal frameworks addressing AI ethics, identifying regulatory gaps and proposing adaptive policy recommendations to address the unique challenges posed by AI-generated text tools.

  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={133-137},
  abstract={This study proposes an algorithm for detecting suspicious behaviors in large payment flows based on deep generative models. By combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE), the algorithm is designed to detect abnormal behaviors in financial transactions. First, the GAN is used to generate simulated data that approximates normal payment flows. The discriminator identifies anomalous patterns in transactions, enabling the detection of potential fraud and money laundering behaviors. Second, a VAE is introduced to model the latent distribution of payment flows, ensuring that the generated data more closely resembles real transaction features, thus improving the model’s detection accuracy. The method optimizes the generative capabilities of both GAN and VAE, ensuring that the model can effectively capture suspicious behaviors even in sparse data conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms and other deep learning models across various evaluation metrics, especially in detecting rare fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, this study provides a detailed comparison of performance in recognizing different transaction patterns (such as normal, money laundering, and fraud) in large payment flows, validating the advantages of generative models in handling complex financial data.},

Thomson Reuters also offers GenAI&#x2010;powered contract review software called &#x201c;Document Intelligence,&#x201d; which it says can cut the amount of time spent searching for information in contracts by 50%. In particular, GenAI can be used to review legal documents and cases, analyze contracts, draft documents, prepare depositions, and write communications. Several GenAI platforms and tools are emerging to serve the legal profession. GenAI can also help to make legal advice more accessible to everyday people, thanks to new tools that offer simple legal advice, and help with translating complex legal jargon into everyday language. Such tools can even help people draw up contracts without having to hire a lawyer.</p>},

  abstract={The interest of artificial intelligence (AI) and mobile edge computing (MEC) has increased in recent years. As a fundamental building block for the development of mobile edge computing, new techniques are needed in the mobile network. Driven by the techniques of Internet of Things (IoT) and AI, MEC, as an emerging paradigm, enables cloud services and AI frontier in close proximity to users, by pushing computing and cache resources from the cloud to the network edge. With the continuous and in-depth research on intelligent mobile networks, green edge intelligence would be a new paradigm of MEC. AI is playing a more important role in the mobile edge computing. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of recent work on AI and MEC. Specially, we first review the various AI techniques. We then propose a novel concept of green edge intelligence. Finally, by using a case study on edge caching with AI techniques, we demonstrate the thrilling effectiveness of AI.

  abstract={Generative adverse Networks (GANs) have become increasingly famous for a variety of tasks in picture and audio processing, especially unsupervised getting to know. GANs encompass components, a “generator” and a “discriminator,” that are skilled adversarial. The generator is tasked with producing a pattern of statistics, and the discriminator is tasked with figuring out whether the information is “actual” or “fake.” The generator “learns” through trial and mistakes as it attempts to create samples that appear practical to the discriminator. Through the antagonistic schooling manner, the generator can create more accurate “fake” records while the discriminator can emerge as better at distinguishing between “actual” and “faux” records. GANs have been applied to various duties, which include picture era, textual content to photosynthesis, photo-to-image translation, and automatic music composition. Recent tries have been made to apply GANs to extra complicated obligations in the wild, including self-reliant use and drug discovery. GANs have inspired an ever-developing quantity of industries because of their potential to generate sensible facts with minimal human input.},

  abstract={With the development of artificial intelligence and cryptography, intelligent cryptography will be the trend of encrypted communications in the future. Abadi designed an encrypted communication model based on a generative adversarial network, which can communicate securely when the adversary knows the ciphertext. The communication party and the adversary fight against each other to continuously improve their own capabilities to achieve a state of secure communication. However, this model can only have a better communication effect under the 16 bits communication length, and cannot adapt to the length of modern encrypted communication. Combine the neural network structure in DCGAN to optimize the neural network of the original model, and at the same time increase the batch normalization process, and optimize the loss function in the original model. Experiments show that under the condition of the maximum 2048-bit communication length, the decryption success rate of communication reaches about 0.97, while ensuring that the adversary’s guess error rate is about 0.95, and the training speed is greatly increased to keep it below 5000 steps, ensuring safety and efficiency Communication.},

  abstract={The infectious disease tuberculosis (TB) continues to pose a serious risk to global health specially in developing world. There are over 10 million new cases of tuberculosis each year. Machine and deep learning models are trained to recognize specific pixels inside a medical image for the purposes of classification and disease progression tracking, however the decision-making mechanism of these models is hidden from the user. In this context, Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) refers to strategies that allow humans to understand the results of AI algorithms. Recently, a variety of XAI methods for classification and generative have been proposed; however, these methods only use a subset of most discriminative power characteristics, resulting in false positives. This article proposes CycleGAN-based multi-functional generative adversarial networks to efficiently solve these challenges. Proposed model is trained in weakly supervised context to identify and visualize the disease effects and finally generate binary mask in data augmentation context. The model takes a Chest radiography (CXR) as input, creates a change map showing the disease's effect at a specific spot, and then uses this map to create a binary mask of original image. Results on publicly available TB dataset, TBX11K, confirm that the proposed model produces highly accurate result.},

  abstract={The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and HumanComputer Interaction (HCI) has grown significantly in the last decade. Speech Recognition (SR) and more specifically Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is still a growing field with quite a few academic and private companies doing research. Currently, SER is not specifically geared toward African-based languages. The paper is to show how to create an Afrikaans-based speech corpora to train a Neural Network (NN). Method-wise, speech samples are extracted from streamed broadcasts. A local Afrikaans Youtube channel is used. Care is taken that the ‘‘Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)’’ is always adhered to. In cases where the creative commons license is not available, authorization has been obtained. The speech clips are saved in.wav format. The emotions captured are Anger, Anticipation, Disgust, Joy, Sadness, Suprise, Fear and Trust. All data is anonymized. The recorded clips are verified by a second independent party and if required verified again by another. This makes sure that categorization is correct. The result is an Afrikaans speech corpus with roughly 800 speech clips. Finally, LTSM is applied to the dataset, and the new Afrikaans corpora yielded a detection accuracy of 58% and 74% with transfer learning.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized medical imaging, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy via the evaluation of X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. However, the effectiveness of AI models is hindered due to high costs, privacy concerns, and challenges in acquiring large annotated datasets. Artificial data generation techniques, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and hybrid models like Disc-VAE, have gained prominence in dealing with these barriers. These techniques aim to augment datasets while preserving the complicated capabilities inherent to medical images. This paper compares the efficacy of Vector Quantized VAE with GAN and Disc-VAE using metrics Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). The Vector Quantized VAE outperforms GAN and Disc-VAE in terms of SSIM and PSNR metrics. The findings spotlight the transformative capability of synthetic information augmentation for the medical system by enabling early and accurate disease diagnosis.

  abstract={Decentralized governance is going through radical changes due to the innovative use of blockchain which allows decisions to be made in a transparent, secure and more im- portantly, immutable way, without the authority of a single individual or party. Thus, the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) in blockchain governing systems complicates such thing as transparency and trust, especially in the case of deep AI systems. But more on this later – this is where Explainable AI or XAI comes into the picture. XAI methods enable understanding of the reasons behind the choices made by AI models and solves the "black box" problem that is predominant in machine learn- ing. When applied to decentralised governance, XAI provides clarifications of AI’s decision making in such areas as voting, resource distribution and the enactment of smart contracts. This way, the stakeholders are confident that the decision-making is fair and impartial and this is made possible by the use of XAI. This paper aims to find out more about the applicability of XAI concept in blockchain –based governance systems in terms of bias and fairness in automated decisions and explanation of the decisions made. The reasons why interpretability plays the crucial role in decentralized systems are explained with the help of the comparison between the classical artificial intelligence and the Xin Intelligent. The study also looks at various use cases such as, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and voting systems implemented on blockchain platforms and how XAI can enhance the performance of the governance systems. As this study shows, XAI is vital in building trust, improving responsibility, and guaranteeing balanced majorities in decentralized blockchain governance structures.},

  title={ChatGPT, Finances, and Degree Attainment: Increasing Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Utilization and Implications for Students' Decision-Making}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Students’ decision-making related to attending college for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees and retaining them within those fields continue to be of focus, especially when considering the national goal of satisfying industry, private, and public sector workforce needs. This is particularly important when considering growing national security concerns and ongoing high cybersecurity and climate change workforce demands. However, despite concerted efforts, low enrollment and student attrition continue to be a challenge, even more so since the onset of the global pandemic. Simultaneously, the utilization of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a sharp increase since 2022 by various stakeholders, most notably college students. Additionally, faculty are encouraged by their higher education institutions to incorporate these tools within classrooms for several reasons, including demands from industry for students to gain knowledge and experience with generative AI tools. Given the importance of understanding the ongoing issue of STEM degree attrition and the increasing utilization of generative AI, this research study explored these two areas using ChatGPT, one of the world's most utilized generative AI language models, within the process. The first research question (RQ#l) is: What is the top reason why students do notfinish college? The response provided solely emphasized finances and/or financial constraints. Based on that answer, the second research question (RQ #2) was: Is getting a college degree worth the cost? RQ #2 was explored to allow a deeper understanding of the initial research question from a different angle. Both questions were analyzed through the lens of two theoretical frameworks, the human capital theory and the principal-agent theory, and results were compared to the literature as a form of research validation. This research study is essential as there is an ongoing increase in the utilization of generative AI in homes, K-12 institutions, and higher education for everyday knowledge, formal and informal education. When considering that soon-to-be and current college students may be using these generative AI tools to make decisions related to pursuing and/or retaining their educational status, it is essential to explore how generative AI system outputs align with what has been researched and documented in the literature. Therefore, this research study explored the application of ChatGPT and the system's responses to research questions as a form of document analysis and analyzed those results using triangulation as a form of validation. The analysis and results of this study contributed directly to the recommendations and feedback to the owners of ChatGPT - OpenAI. Additionally, the results highlighted a need for increased focus on AI ethics related to data input, data output, access to the system, and who has a seat at the table as the company recommends, approves, and implements changes. Limitations of this study are provided along with an overarching concluding statement.},

  abstract={Lung cancer continues to be a predominant cause of cancer-related mortality globally, and early diagnosis with computed tomography (CT) imaging markedly enhances patient outcomes. The limited availability of annotated medical imaging data presents a significant obstacle in developing effective deep learning models for lung nodule detection. This paper presents a system based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate realistic lung nodule images, tackling the issues of data imbalance and augmentation in medical imaging. Utilizing the LIDC-IDRI dataset, comprising expert-annotated thoracic CT scans, we train a conditional GAN to produce high-quality synthetic lung nodule patches based on size and malignancy characteristics. Synthetic data is combined with real samples to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier, leading to enhanced performance metrics in accuracy, sensitivity, and AUC-ROC. Qualitative and quantitative assessments indicate that our GAN-generated images closely mimic authentic nodules, as validated by radiomic feature distributions and visual Turing tests. The suggested generative methodology improves model generalizability, facilitates clinical decision-making, and establishes a foundation for data-efficient AI systems in pulmonary diagnostics. This study emphasizes the capacity of generative AI to enhance medical datasets and facilitate early-stage lung cancer identification.},

Using Tyler's goal-focused model, GenAI (XIPU AI) simulated the roles of teachers, curriculum committee members, and novice teachers to evaluate FDLD-based design versus traditional design in an undergraduate Artificial intelligence and programming course (Module M). The results show that FDLD significantly improves the clarity of learning objectives through diverse interactive activities (such as experiments, collaborative tasks) and balanced summative assessments consistent with Bloom's classification. GenAI provides a structured, objective assessment that validates the FDLD's adaptability to novice teachers and its consistency with institutional standards. The findings highlight the efficacy of FDLD in promoting higher-order thinking and the potential of GenAI as a scalable evaluator.},

  volume={4},

  pages={1076-1088},
  abstract={A myriad of recent literary works have leveraged generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate unseen evasion samples. The purpose is to annex the generated data with the original train set for adversarial training to improve the detection performance of machine learning (ML) classifiers. The quality of generated adversarial samples relies on the adequacy of training data samples. However, in low data regimes like medical diagnostic imaging and cybersecurity, the anomaly samples are scarce in number. This paper proposes a novel GAN design called evasion generative adversarial network (EVAGAN) that is more suitable for low data regime problems that use oversampling for detection improvement of ML classifiers. EVAGAN not only can generate evasion samples but its discriminator can act as an evasion-aware classifier. We have considered auxiliary classifier GAN (ACGAN) as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of EVAGAN on cybersecurity (ISCX-2014, CIC-2017, and CIC2018) botnet and computer vision (MNIST) datasets. We demonstrate that EVAGAN outperforms ACGAN for unbalanced datasets with respect to detection performance, training stability, and time complexity. EVAGAN's generator quickly learns to generate the low sample class and hardens its discriminator simultaneously. In contrast to ML classifiers that require security hardening after being adversarially trained by GAN-generated data, EVAGAN renders it needless. The experimental analysis proves that EVAGAN is an efficient evasion hardened model for low data regimes for the selected cybersecurity and computer vision datasets.},

  pages={168-173},
  abstract={In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), native generative AI (GenAI) has become prominent in generating intelligent cyber-attacks in a smart grid environment by imitating operational parameters and metrics. As a result, it is imperative to understand the attack generation capabilities of native GenAI models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Autoencoders in a smart grid environment. This research aims to explore the potential of GenAI models to accurately imitate and analyze the behavior of cyberattacks within a smart grid environment. The goal is to understand the risks posed by these intelligent attacks while developing strategies to protect against disruptive Distributed Energy Resources (DER) events, such as incorrect load shifting, imbalanced demand supply, and unstable price forecasting. First, this work leverages two customized native GenAI models, namely GAN and Autoencoder, to synthesize DERs control message parameters such as nominal power consumption, price elasticity coefficients, and communication data packets, among others, to introduce highly unpredictable new intelligent attack vectors. Second, this research proposes and develops a new Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) framework by creating correlation dependency nodes among DER control message parameters to understand the risks of intelligent attack vectors better while monitoring and mitigating their impact on smart grid operations. In particular, by leveraging the customized BBN, the system can observe and analyze the uncertain behaviors in DER operations that GenAI introduces, and the proposed framework can help mitigate grid vulnerabilities by understanding the poisonous parameters through mutual information. Finally, the experiment results show that the Autoencoder outperformed GAN in reproducing intelligent attacks with an MSE about 98.984% lower than that of GANs. Additionally, BBN can explain prominent parameters of the intelligent attacks’ by quantifying dependencies through mutual information.},

  abstract={With the development of information technology, teaching reforms have been innovated, and the quality of university programs has become higher and higher. However, the emergence and widespread application of deep generative models have brought more challenges and opportunities to classroom teaching. With the continuous development of educational technology and the updating of teaching concepts, the depth generation model, as an emerging teaching mode, is gradually receiving attention from the educational community. In order to verify the effectiveness of the depth generation model, this study selected a certain number of college English classes as experimental subjects, and conducted in-depth data analysis and discussion by comparing the differences between the experimental group and the control group in terms of the frequency of interactions, the quality of interactions, the degree of student participation and learning effects. By comparing the classroom effects of using a deep generative modelling classroom with a traditional classroom, the study found that students’ overall grades in English classrooms using deep generative modelling improved by approximately 31 points, and that the average completion rate of assignments in deep generative modelling classrooms was 94.8%, which was much higher than that of traditional classrooms.},

However, the field of AI got officially defined in 1956 with a workshop organized by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project. The goal of this conference was to investigate ways in which machines could be made to simulate aspects of intelligence. In 1965, computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, an early conversational AI program capable of natural language interaction. Though intended to showcase the superficiality of communication between humans and artificial intelligence, ELIZA's uncannily human&#x2010;like responses led many to curiously anthropomorphize its underlying system. The possibility to use massive volumes of data changed everything and triggered a new boom supported by the Big Data era, the access to large amounts of data, cheaper and faster computers, and progress on machine learning.</p>},

  abstract={The artificial intelligence (AI) space has been revolutionized recently by the advent of generative AI models that allow machine-generated content to appear visually identical to content generated by real people. The newly emerging field employs a variety of techniques and architectures to produce different kinds of outputs, ranging from text and images to music and full synthetic environments. One of the most popular paradigms of such field is the family of generative models, and, recently, the subfamily of large language models (LLMs). Thus, generative AI, including LLMs, is based on the conception of probability distribution. This is when technology feds many datasets and learns the patterns and laws that hide under that data, enabling the AI to write effectively. LLMs have been used to schedule and seed texts naturally across various domains, from training transformer-like models, to code prototyping, writing, and journal narration. Thus, to resolve the challenges associated with it, an integrated nature of modeling with the training techniques is evolved, which eventually follows all the rules, regulations, as well as guidelines that help in successful implementation of generative models and LLMs.},

  abstract={This thesis investigates the synergies between Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Intelligent Bot Development as well as Robotic Process Automation (RPA). Goals are to explore how GANs can boost RPA systems’ functionality through crude high fidelity synthetic data capabilities, improved natural language understanding which allows bots to handle complex user conversations. At the expected outcome the aim was to develop smarter and more flexible bots who can solve a wider range of problems in more flexible environment. Incorporating GANs, this research hopes to push forward RPA systems leading to more efficient, flexible, and intelligent automation solutions. In addition, the study will show how GANs enable organizations to rapidly prototype and simulate bot performance, and when combined with AI driven processes, make it easier to deploy new approaches that both improve bot performance, and human bot interaction. In the end, this work would reveal a full understanding of how GANs can dramatically transform intelligent automation by creating context understanding interactive and scalable bot systems.},

  abstract={This research full paper delves into university in-structors' experiences and attitudes toward AI language models, filling a gap in the literature by analyzing educators' perspectives on AI's role in the classroom and its potential impacts on teaching and learning. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and the expanding integration of large language models (LLMs) have ignited a debate about their application in education. The objective of this research is to investigate the level of awareness, overall sentiment towards adoption, and the factors influencing these attitudes for LLMs and generative AI-based tools in higher education. Data was collected through a survey using a Likert scale, which was complemented by follow-up interviews to gain a more nuanced understanding of the instructors' viewpoints. The collected data was processed using statistical and thematic analysis techniques. Our findings reveal that educators are increasingly aware of and generally positive towards these tools. We find no correlation between teaching style and attitude toward generative AI. Finally, while CS educators show far more confidence in their technical understanding of generative AI tools and more positivity towards them than educators in other fields, they show no more confidence in their ability to detect AI-generated work.},

  abstract={The next generation of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) poses a variety of important societal problems, including the possible crises and upheavals of the AI machine, which could cause fundamental changes. As the discussion around Artificial Superintelligence underscores the importance of continual dialogue between man and its ability to control technology, it also raises the problem of designing intelligent interactive and collaborative tools and systems to allow this dialogue. Historically, the term “AI” was used from 1950 to 1975, then fell out of favor during the” AI winter” from 1975 to 1995, and was narrowed to ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence). As a result, terms like “Machine Learning,” “Natural language Processing,” and “Data Science” were frequently mislabelled as AI. Today, AI has allowed clinicians to rely heavily on ML which is highly integrated with coding, billing, medical records, scheduling, contracting, medication ordering, and administrative functions. AI is now a thriving industry with massive capital investments and once again is on the verge of a great revolution. There are compelling reasons to investigate artificial super intelligence. This type of AI is capable of surpassing human intellect by expressing cognitive skills and developing its own mental capabilities. ASI is a highly sophisticated, and intelligent type of AI that goes beyond normal intellectual capacity. This paper will discuss the societal impact and the current academic impact of ASI. Finally, this study would attempt to utilize the Markov Decision Model of Machine Learning to predict the trajectory of ASI in the very near future.},

  title={Towards next-generation federated learning: A case study on privacy attacks in artificial intelligence systems}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1446-1453},
  abstract={Accurate and trust are crucial for ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI) markets. One of the challenges is data leakage, which is frequently overlooked but possesses highly consequential implications. Federated learning (FL) is recognised as a new era of secure AI systems. The market for FL is estimated to reach USD 266.77 million by 2030 according to Polaris Market Research (1). This paper focuses on FL-based approaches for improving AI safety and examines the significance of Deep learning (DL) and its privacy implications. This has been achieved through six models: Federated Convolutional Neural Network (F-CNN), Federated averaging CNN (FA-CNN), Federated Adam (FA), Malicious Generative adversarial network (MGAN), Federated M-GAN (FMGAN) and Conditional GAN (CGAN). The authors analysed MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and conducted extensive numerical evaluations to confirm improved user privacy in federated learning for AI models. A case study with fast convergence speed and excellent asymptotic test accuracy was designed to outline White-box attacks on MGAN, FMGAN, and CGAN models. The study also implemented active inference attacks on deep neural networks without sharing raw data through FL. We created 256 synthetic images specifically to test the effectiveness of the original classifier. These counterfeit visuals effectively deceived the classifier, appearing as legitimate representations of true class labels. Trimming shared parameters was ineffective in preventing the attack, revealing limitations in collaborative learning. The generator shows the least loss of 0.0104 encountered of all models in the study. Our Generator is also the fastest after the FMGAN model. FMGAN performs best with maximum accuracy (0.9613) followed by CGAN (0.9208), MGAN (0.9163), FA (0.5148), FCNN (0.4376) and FACNN (0.4285). It also demonstrated high efficiency by successfully attacking in a short timeframe of 0.7459 milliseconds. The Federated approach led by Adam exhibited the longest processing time, at approximately 10.52 minutes. The case study illustrates the risks of surveillance and manipulation by attackers, who pressured participants to disclose confidential information. It also aimed to increase flexibility and robustness. Our work is accessible to diverse audiences, facilitating the adoption and practical applications of deep learning methods for privacy protection by major corporations.},

  abstract={In the face of increasingly complex network environments, this study aims to improve the ability of information network security situation awareness. Through artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies based on the isolation forest (IF) algorithm, a multi-level and modular security situation awareness framework is constructed. The framework integrates deep learning, natural language processing and adaptive learning technologies to perform indepth analysis and feature extraction on multi-source data to improve the detection, identification and response capabilities of network threats. Experimental results show that the framework exhibits high detection accuracy and an average response time of less than 100 seconds in standardized tests, and effectively responds to emergencies through adaptive learning modules. Multiple simulated network attack scenarios verify the performance and reliability of the framework under different conditions. The research results establish the effectiveness of the isolation forest algorithm in information network security and show advantages in key indicators such as false alarm rate, accuracy, detection delay and true negative rate. Future research will continue to explore the integration of multi-source information to improve recognition performance in complex network environments.},

  abstract={Unprecedented advances in Artificial Intelligence and its widespread applications in diverse fields without a sufficient social, ethical, legal, or technological framework to oversee it have sparked concerns about its decisions having ethical and social implications. Identifying and addressing the ethical issues of artificial intelligence has been a topic of great importance to researchers, governments, law enforcement agencies, and corporations, given the growing concerns of individuals, organizations, countries, and society. However, very little progress has been made to address them. These ethical and social issues, such as privacy breaches, bias, discrimination, non-accountability, less transparency, unemployment, promoting inequality, social manipulation, loss of human relationships, and independence, inevitably impact the existing social order and raise ethical concerns. This paper provides an overview and analysis of ethical issues, strategies for dealing with them, and techniques for assessing the ethics associated with artificial intelligence. Additionally, the study underscores the increasing ethical and social ramifications arising from the expanding use of technology in various domains. It also highlights insufficient technical solutions and a fitting framework to tackle these concerns. Ultimately, the paper emphasizes the necessity for thorough research to identify suitable technological solutions to address these ethical challenges.},

  abstract={This research-to-practice paper presents a curriculum, “AI Literacy for All,” to promote an interdisciplinary under-standing of AI, its socio-technical implications, and its practical applications for all levels of education. With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), there is a need for AI literacy that goes beyond the traditional AI education curriculum. AI literacy has been conceptualized in various ways, including public literacy, competency building for designers, conceptual understanding of AI concepts, and domain-specific upskilling. Most of these conceptualizations were established before the public release of Generative AI (Gen-AI) tools such as ChatGPT. AI education has focused on the principles and applications of AI through a technical lens that emphasizes the mastery of AI principles, the mathematical foundations underlying these technologies, and the programming and mathematical skills necessary to implement AI solutions. The non-technical component of AI literacy has often been limited to social and ethical implications, privacy and security issues, or the experience of interacting with AI. In AI Literacy for all, we emphasize a balanced curriculum that includes technical as well as non-technical learning outcomes to enable a conceptual understanding and critical evaluation of AI technologies in an interdisciplinary socio-technical context. The paper presents four pillars of AI literacy: understanding the scope and technical dimensions of AI, learning how to interact with Gen-AI in an informed and responsible way, the socio-technical issues of ethical and responsible AI, and the social and future implications of AI. While it is important to include all learning outcomes for AI education in a Computer Science major, the learning outcomes can be adjusted for other learning contexts, including, non-CS majors, high school summer camps, the adult workforce, and the public. This paper advocates for a shift in AI literacy education to offer a more interdisciplinary socio-technical approach as a pathway to broaden participation in AI. This approach not only broadens students' perspectives but also prepares them to think critically about integrating AI into their future professional and personal lives.},

In the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain, it has also been identified that scrutinising the development context and path of AI will be able to help both academia and industry better understand the current AI limitations, reveal future AI trends, and facilitate AI/digital transformations. [Objectives]: Given the dramatic boom of modern AI, this research aims to unearth the evolution pattern along the recent three AI waves (namely predictive AI, generative AI and agentic AI), and accordingly to guide AI research and development to focus on the most promising directions. [Method]: We employed analogical reasoning as the research method and referred to the existing software architectural styles to inspire our understanding of the architectural evolution of modern AI technologies. [Results]: We see a service-oriented trend in modern AI's working mechanisms, and the offering of AI power seems to be transiting from a heavyweight and monolithic paradigm to an organisational and collaborative paradigm with more and more specific separation of concerns. Following this service-oriented evolution trend, we borrow software architecture lessons and foresee opportunities to grow the current AI wave to a further height, e.g., standardising AI agent-friendly APIs and developing serverless AI agents. [Conclusions]: What is happening in the AI domain has happened before in the software engineering domain. It is worth reusing software architecture knowledge to evolve the architecture of AI technologies.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence and cyber-physical systems (CPS) are two of the key technologies of the future that are enabling major global shifts. However, most of the current implementations of AI in CPS are not explainable, which creates serious problems in ethical, legal, regulatory, and other domains. Therefore, it is necessary for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to be integrated with cyber-physical systems to meet the vital needs for control, fairness, accountability, safety, cyber-resilience, and cybersecurity. The goal of this review is to demonstrate the need, benefits, challenges, and implementation of XAI for CPS. We review the existing literature about XAI and CPS, discuss the current state of the art, examine applications in different domains, and make recommendations for future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first peer-reviewed academic article to provide a comprehensive review of general XAI for CPS. We also contribute new research ideas including development of multisensory explanations and outputs for these systems, application of XAI to CPS to decrease occupational burnout and increase employee engagement, and enumeration of the multidisciplinary goals and benefits of XAI as applied to cyber-physical systems.},

The intermediate designers have been working in the design and related industries for over two years. The comparison is about design quality and efficiency, evaluated by 20 volunteers. Empirically we find over 50% of the paintings generated by SmartPaint are more preferred than those drawn by human designers along creativity, artistic quality and color scheme. Besides, SmartPaint takes only less than 1% of the time spended by human designers.},

  abstract={The transition to 6G networks introduces a range of challenges due to increasing complexity, data traffic growth, and the demand for personalized services. Traditional network management techniques are no longer sufficient, as 6G networks require faster speeds, lower latency, and the capacity to support advanced applications. Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) offer a flexible architecture that facilitates the integration of hardware and software from diverse vendors, addressing some of these challenges. As networks continue to evolve, AI-driven solutions are becoming essential for ensuring seamless operations and optimizing performance.

  abstract={The analysis of retinal vessel imaging can diagnose and monitor various diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and so on. However, testing of retinal vessels requires professional clinicians to examine and evaluate digital colorful fundus images. This process consumes a lot of time and human labor, so automated fundus image segmentation models are necessary to provide decision-making. We propose an end-toend retinal vessel segmentation model based on a Generative Adversarial Network. First of all, a self-made amplifier was added to magnify the fundus images for generator. Next, we generated probability maps of retinal vessels. Experiments on two public fundus datasets, Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE) and Structured Analysis of the Retina (STARE), showed that our method outperforms the state-ofthe-art methods in terms of the accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.},

  pages={167412-167425},
  abstract={As communication technology advances with 5G, the amount of data accumulated online is explosively increasing. From these data, valuable results are being created through data analysis technologies. Among them, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown remarkable performances in various fields and is emerging as an innovative technology. In particular, machine learning and deep learning models are evolving rapidly and are being widely deployed in practical applications. Meanwhile, behind the widespread use of these models, privacy concerns have been continuously raised. In addition, as substantial privacy invasion attacks against machine learning and deep learning models have been proposed, the importance of research on privacy-preserving AI is being emphasized. Accordingly, in the field of differential privacy, which has become a de facto standard for preserving privacy, various mechanisms have been proposed to preserve the privacy of AI models. However, it is unclear how to calibrate appropriate privacy parameters, taking into account the trade-off between a model’s utility and data privacy. Moreover, there is a lack of research that analyzes the relationship between the degree of differential privacy guarantee and privacy invasion attacks. In this paper, we investigate the resistance of differentially private AI models to substantial privacy invasion attacks according to the degree of privacy guarantee, and analyze how privacy parameters should be set to prevent the attacks while preserving the utility of the models. Specifically, we focus on generative adversarial networks (GAN), which is one of the most sophisticated AI models, and on the membership inference attack, which is the most fundamental privacy invasion attack. In the experimental evaluation, by quantifying the effectiveness of the attack based on the degree of privacy guarantee, we show that differential privacy can simultaneously preserve data privacy and the utility of models with moderate privacy budgets.},

  abstract={Time series forecasting has widespread applications in everyday life, e.g. in the domains of weather forecasting, transportation planning, and electricity demand prediction. Due to the high dimensions, uncertainties, and changes of data in time series, accurately predicting future trends of time series remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a new time series forecasting model, the Generative Adversarial Network Model with Attention Mechanism (GANAM), which uses a global residual network to enhance the attention mechanism module and acts as a generator to learn the deep temporal features and then uses the discriminator of the generative adversarial network for improving the forecasting capability. In addition, the classical time series model can lead to an accumulation of errors in the multi-step prediction process. The proposed model also can effectively reduce this problem by utilizing the generative adversarial network with an attention mechanism. The experiments on various real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model.},

  pages={2929-2940},
  abstract={In this paper, a novel denoising method for electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is proposed to improve performance and availability under multiple noise cases. The method is based on the framework of conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), and we improved the CGAN framework for ECG denoising. The proposed framework consists of two networks: a generator that is composed of the optimized convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) and a discriminator that is composed of four convolution layers and one full connection layer. As the convolutional layers of CAE can preserve spatial locality and the neighborhood relations in the latent higher-level feature representations of ECG signal, and the skip connection facilitates the gradient propagation in the denoising training process, the trained denoising model has good performance and generalization ability. The extensive experimental results on MIT-BIH databases show that for single noise and mixed noises, the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of denoised ECG signal is above 39 dB, and it is better than that of the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the denoised classification results of four cardiac diseases show that the average accuracy increased above 32$\%$ under multiple noises under SNR=0 dB. So, the proposed method can remove noise effectively as well as keep the details of the features of ECG signals.},

  abstract={In this study, we introduce LSN-GAN, a new algorithm designed to improve Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by implementing Least Square Gradient Normalization. This technique adjusts gradients in the GAN's discriminator, making training more stable by avoiding common issues like gradient blow-up or disappearance. Our goal is to make GANs more reliable and enhance the quality of generated images. We tested LSN-GAN against existing models using the CIFAR-10 and LSUN Church Outdoor datasets. Our method was evaluated based on the Inception Score, which measures image quality and diversity, and the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), which assesses the similarity between generated and real images. LSN-GAN showed improved results, achieving higher Inception Scores and lower FID values compared to models like SN-GAN and GN-GAN, indicating better image generation capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that LSN-GAN not only proposes a novel approach to handling gradients in GANs but also significantly enhances the output image quality. This makes LSN-GAN a promising tool for advancing the field of generative models and their applications in image generation.},

  abstract={Wheat yield prediction is key to food security and optimal resource use. In this paper, Generative AI is use for specifically GANs and VAEs, to predict wheat yield under different weather conditions, uses the crop yield prediction dataset from Kaggle which has temperature, rainfall and soil quality as parameters and build models that beat traditional statistical methods. By leveraging advanced AI models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), the model generates synthetic data that mimics these rare occurrences. The GAN generates synthetic data that enriches the training set and improves prediction accuracy. The VAE captures the complex non-linear relationships between input features and output. The combination of both models gives us a robust framework for yield prediction. Experimental results shows that the GAN dataset gives 14% improvement over baseline models. VAE model gives 13% improvement on its own, showing its ability to handle the variability and complexity of agricultural data. This dual model approach is a big leap in agricultural analytics and will enable more robust and adaptive farming in the face of climate change.},

  abstract={Two evaluation metrics for GAN models have been proposed in existing studies: Inception score (IS) and Fréchet Inception distance (FID). We propose a new GAN model based on the idea that backpropagating the FID score would guide the GAN to efficiently learn the distribution of real images and generate high-quality images. Based on such an idea, we propose a training loss for the generator to minimize a modified FID loss. Trained with the CIFAR-10 dataset, FIDGAN exhibited an FID of 11.78, which corresponds to a reduced FID compared to an existing model called BigGAN by 20.0%.},

  abstract={SAR images possess unique attributes that present challenges for both human observers and vision AI models to interpret, owing to their electromagnetic characteristics. The interpretation of SAR images encounters various hurdles, with one of the primary obstacles being the data itself, which includes issues related to both the quantity and quality of the data. The challenges can be addressed using generative AI technologies. Generative AI, often known as GenAI, is a very advanced and powerful technology in the field of artificial intelligence that has gained significant attention. The advancement has created possibilities for the creation of texts, photorealistic pictures, videos, and material in various modalities. This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the intersection of GenAI and SAR. First, we illustrate the common data generation-based applications in SAR field and compare them with computer vision tasks, analyzing the similarity, difference, and general challenges of them. Then, an overview of the latest GenAI models is systematically reviewed, including various basic models and their variations targeting the general challenges. Additionally, the corresponding applications in SAR domain are also included. Specifically, we propose to summarize the physical model based simulation approaches for SAR, and analyze the hybrid modeling methods that combine the GenAI and interpretable models. The evaluation methods that have been or could be applied to SAR, are also explored. Finally, the potential challenges and future prospects are discussed. To our best knowledge, this survey is the first exhaustive examination of the interdiscipline of SAR and GenAI, encompassing a wide range of topics, including deep neural networks, physical models, computer vision, and SAR images.},

  abstract={Many studies have demonstrated that generative AI (GenAI) feedback has potential in language learning; however, few studies explore how learners' self-efficacy shapes their metacognitive and behavioural engagement with GenAI feedback. This study investigates differences in metacognitive strategy networks and behavioural sequences between high and low self-efficacy learners interacting with GenAI feedback in reading comprehension tasks. By integrating epistemic network analysis (ENA), sequential analysis, and retrospective interviews, this study analysed the interactions of 16 junior secondary students with five types of GenAI feedback. The results revealed that high self-efficacy learners develop metacognitive networks centred on evaluating and dynamically cycling between feedback types to inform future learning. In contrast, low self-efficacy learners displayed a metacognitive strategy network dominated by planning and linear behavioural sequences that prioritise immediate task completion. The findings advocate for self-efficacy-driven GenAI feedback systems that dynamically tailor metacognitive scaffolding to catalyse personalised self-regulated learning.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence has garnered significant interest in higher education, with growing concerns about its consequences for teaching, learning, and assessment. Educators are now faced with the task of adopting genAI into curricula in ways that are responsive to both the short- and long-term effects of this technological disruption on learning. This study considers these effects, focusing on the impacts of genAI on the intrinsic value of learning and its influences on shaping transformative encounters with knowledge in STEM curricula. The implications of incorporating genAI into outcomes and assessment tasks are examined using a constructivist approach based on taxonomies of cognitive skills involved in learning and STEM competency development namely, Bloom's and SOLO taxonomies, and Luckett's knowledge planes. The study offers insights into how the incorporation of genAI may influence conceptual knowledge building and the development of certain STEM graduate attributes and makes recommendations for teachers of STEM curricula.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence and digital twin technology show the excellent ability in the fault prognostic and health management of machinery equipment. However, interaction between the data driven and physical informed is a challenge for modeling the digital twin framework. In response to this limitation, a fault mechanism assisted intelligent fault diagnosis method based on improved generative adversarial network for digital twin two-stage gearbox is proposed. Firstly, the twenty-six degree-of-freedom dynamic model is established to realize the virtual entity of two-stage gearbox. The initial parameters of dynamic model are determined by the prior knowledge based on the fault mechanism of gear. Then, the improved generative adversarial network is designed to achieve the interaction of virtual entity and physical entity. The measured signal from the physical entity is used to train the proposed model for minimizing the difference of simulation signal from the dynamic model. The loss of proposed model is introduced by combining the physics knowledge of gear dynamic mechanism and observations from the sensor. Finally, the proposed method is applied to simulate the vibration signal of gear fault under different conditions that is consistent with the measured signal, which can be applied for the fault diagnosis of gear. The two-stage gearbox fault experiments with missing sample are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},
