  abstract={A major study topic, particularly in machine learning and artificial intelligence, has resulted from the prediction of traffic congestion in recent years (AI). During the last few decade, this study field has greatly increased due to the emergence of huge data from stationary sensor or probe vehicle data. Congestion forecasting requires analysing a wide range of traffic variables, especially for short-term planning. Predictions of future traffic congestion are based mostly on analyses of past patterns. Using traffic data like taxi trip records, urban traffic statistics, and junction counts, we propose a new method for calculating traffic flows. The suggested method makes use of CGAN and GCN, and we enhanced Unet to realise a key component of the generator. The interaction between junctions with surveillance and intersections without monitoring is then captured using floating taxis that are spread out over the whole city. The CGAN architecture may modify the weights and improve the inference capability to provide an accurate traffic status under the present circumstances. The results of the experiment demonstrate that our technique is more accurate at estimating traffic volume than other methods.},

  abstract={The evaluation of intelligence levels is crucial in assessing the capabilities of unmanned clusters. Currently, this process is often determined subjectively, leading to potential biases and missing evaluation indicators due to limited simulation experiments. To address these issues, this paper introduces an objective method for determining intelligence levels using the ELO rating algorithm and constructs an intelligence level evaluation model based on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to account for missing evaluation indicators. The model takes evaluation indicators as input and ELO scores as output, providing an objective reflection of the intelligence capabilities of unmanned clusters. Using an airground collaborative encirclement task as an example, the model is trained to evaluate the intelligence levels of unmanned clusters objectively. Simulation results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in quantifying intelligence levels objectively and its applicability to a wide range of unmanned clusters.},

  year={2025},

  pages={400-406},
  abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered a progressive neurogenerative disorder that highly impacts elder people. Gradually this disease results in memory loss, poor thinking capacity, and overall cognitive decline. Nevertheless, various traditional works recommend that the pathological variations present in the brain happen decades prior to the initial clinical signs appearing. The implementation of cost-effective and noninvasive approaches to identify AD is significant for its timely mitigation as well as prevention. Therefore, in this article, an advanced generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided AD detection approach is designed using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which are helpful for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression very effectively. The EEG signals required for the identification of AD are collected from benchmark sources and are applied as the input to the ShortTerm Fourier Transform (STFT) for spectrogram image conversion. The AD detection is done using the proposed Attention-based Generative Adversarial Network (A-GAN), which produces the most desirable detection outcomes by classifying the input STFT images. The classification results are compared with the baseline AD detection approaches to validate the performance of the designed technique using various measures. The developed model supports earlier detection and provides highly more effective treatment interventions.},

  pages={7528-7540},
  abstract={The recent development of generative art, a typical category of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC), is essentially beneficial for social good, which can help amateurs to create artwork and improve experts’ efficiency. However, some artists are opposed to generative art technologies due to the copyright infringement and influence of the artists’ way of earning a living, which makes the artists protest against generative art technologies, causing a lose–lose situation. Adversarial attacks against generative model training are potential solutions to address this issue, while the lose–lose situation cannot be improved. To build a win–win situation, a feasible method is to incentivize the artists to actively contribute their artworks to generative model training without influencing their living or infringing copyright, such as data crowdsourcing, but traditional data crowdsourcing methods cannot well fit the generative art area. Therefore, this article builds a blockchain-based trading system for generative model training data collection and generated artwork circulation. Specifically, this article formulates a social welfare maximization problem based on the reverse auction and designs a corresponding incentive mechanism. The conducted theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed incentive mechanism toward a win–win situation for generative art model trainers and artists.},

  abstract={The evolution of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) constitutes a turning point in reshaping the future of technology in different aspects. Wireless networks, in particular, with the blooming of self-evolving networks, represent a rich field for exploiting GenAI and reaping several benefits that can fundamentally change the way wireless networks are designed and operated nowadays. To be specific, large GenAI models are envisioned to open up a new era of autonomous wireless networks, in which multi-modal GenAI models trained over various Telecom data, can be fine-tuned to perform several downstream tasks, eliminating the need for building and training dedicated AI models for each specific task, and paving the way for the realization of artificial general intelligence (AGI)-empowered wireless networks. In this article, we aim to unfold the opportunities that can be reaped from integrating large GenAI models into the Telecom domain. In particular, we first highlight the applications of large GenAI models in future wireless networks, defining potential use-cases and revealing insights on the associated theoretical and practical challenges. Furthermore, we unveil how 6G can open up new opportunities through connecting multiple on-device large GenAI models, and hence, pave the way to the collective intelligence paradigm. Finally, we put a forward-looking vision of how large GenAI models will be the key to realize self-evolving networks.},

  abstract={Summary <p>The automated detection and tracking of objects in motion from visual data like images and videos is a classic problem in computer vision that has gained renewed interest and seen great progress with modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. In particular, deep neural networks have shown unmatched capabilities for visual recognition tasks like classifying, localizing and segmenting objects of interest in complex scenes. A key advancement that has enabled the success of these techniques is the development of convolutional neural network (CNN) for moving object detection (MOD). Various architectures based on CNN can identify multiple objects in an image and draw bounding boxes around them. These networks can be trained on large annotated datasets to learn rich visual features automatically, eliminating the need for hand&#x2010;coded feature extraction. Pre&#x2010;trained networks can also be fine&#x2010;tuned for specific use cases involving detection of relevant objects like cars, humans and animals. This object detection capability provides the foundation for tracking objects across multiple frames in a video. AI, ML, and deep learning (DL) consistently outperform classical computer vision techniques for tasks like simultaneous object detection, semantic segmentation, anomaly detection in videos and predicting object trajectories over time. With innovations in neural network architectures, unsupervised and semi&#x2010;supervised learning, and leveraging motion and scene understanding beyond just appearances, the performance on these tasks continues to improve. These techniques provide unmatched capabilities compared to traditional hand&#x2010;coded approaches. With rapid progress in AI, ML and DL, automated and robust motion intelligence has applicability across domains like autonomous vehicles, surveillance, human&#x2010;computer interaction, augmented reality, robotics, and more. These make the future promising for automated motion intelligence using AI, ML and DL. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state&#x2010;of&#x2010;the&#x2010;art techniques and algorithms that leverage traditional, AI, ML and DL for moving object detection (MOD).</p>},

  abstract={The increase in the of online social media networks has increased the frequency of cyberbullying incidents. Cyberbullying is referred to as the aggressive, continuous and intentional use of abusive language and display of hateful behaviour with the intention to harm the individual and his reputation online. The instances of suicides and cases of mental illnesses especially among the youth are on a rise. There are numerous ways in which cyberbullying can affect a person’s life including effecting him mentally and physically. However, the detection techniques for effective cyberbullying detection are limited. The use of techniques like machine Learning, Deep Learning and Generative AI have come to the rescue. Hence, this study discusses the definition, evolution and types of Generative AI. It further discusses the types of cyberbullying. This paper also brings forward the detection techniques for efficient cyberbullying detection which includes both conventional and generative AI based techniques like large language model-based solutions. This paper further explores the future research directions in cyberbullying detection. Hence, this study paves way for efficient detection of cyberbullying thereby leveraging technological solutions for a safer online environment.},

  abstract={Millimeter-wave and Terahertz communications consist of complex analog and mixed-signal transceivers where overall system performance is often limited by the weakest performing subsystem. While analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits have significantly advanced, the future of 5G and 6G transceiver design could be accelerated by including artificial intelligence. In this combination, analog integrated circuit design and operation would harness machine learning to identify, characterize, and act upon variations and anomalies in system performance. Focusing on 5G and 6G, this paper investigates solutions for a unified intelligent integrated transceiver: a conceptual combination of a traditional analog subsystem, a supporting digital subsystem that enables artificial intelligence, and dedicated feedback circuitry or sensors that monitor performance, efficiency, or reliability. Active and passive components and propagation channels are reviewed based on their merits of introducing intelligence. Holistically and for broader applicability, the paper conceptualizes and coins the notion of an “intelligent integrated system (IIS)”, which brings forward a novel unified vision and approach toward context-aware subsystems that dynamically interact with ambient and varying operating conditions. To demonstrate viability, the paper concatenates a select set of measurement results.},

  abstract={This study investigates the changing junction between generative artificial intelligence (AI) and real-time user interface (UI) customisation inside multimedia applications. Powerful artificial intelligence (AI) models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers are changing the design environment as they develop by allowing interfaces that are not only smart but also very flexible. These methods change the conventional design paradigm toward a more collaborative, responsive approach by allowing designers and consumers to co-create tailored UIs that dynamically adjust to individual needs, behaviours, and environments. Reflecting a growing global interest in user-driven generative design, our bibliometric study from 2015 to 2025 shows a steady increase in academic output in this field. Particularly notable in their contributions to the educational and technical progress of this domain have been institutions such as Xidian University and Google Research. The study emphasises a movement toward more interactive and context-aware systems using generative artificial intelligence to enhance user experience across several media channels. However, together with the creative possibilities, this incorporation of artificial intelligence into UI design also brings important ethical obligations. Systems that not only improve functionality and aesthetics but also respect user autonomy, guarantee openness, and protect privacy must be developed. This paper underlines the importance of inclusive design ideas and responsible regulations guiding the use of generative artificial intelligence in UI settings—thereby fostering trust, fairness, and design integrity in more intelligent digital environments.},

  abstract={AIced Prep is an AI-driven system designed to provide individuals with realistic mock interviews and personalized feedback, particularly targeting freshers, job seekers, students, and recruitment agencies. The system aims to build confidence, improve performance, and enhance candidates' chances of success in interviews. To achieve this, the project integrates a Question Generation System using RetrievalAugmented Generation(RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating relevant, unique, and non-repetitive questions. The project fo- cuses on two primary use cases: interview question generation and resume classification and mock interview. By leveraging the Mistral-7B LLM for contextually accurate question generation and FAISS for efficient vector-based retrieval, the system dynami- cally processes documents, including PDFs, to generate questions. The web-based interface, built using FastAPI and Streamlit, ensures users have an interactive and accessible experience. This hybrid approach addresses common challenges in question generation, such as repetitive questions and irrelevant content, by combining information retrieval techniques with generative AI methods. The ultimate goal of AIced Prep is to make quality interview preparation accessible to everyone, providing scalable, efficient, and personalized interview preparation solution.},

  pages={35-46},
  abstract={Trapdoor is a key component of public key cryptography design which is the essential security foundation of modern cryptography. Normally, the traditional way in designing a trapdoor is to identify a computationally hard problem, such as the NPC problems. So the trapdoor in a public key encryption mechanism turns out to be a type of limited resource. In this paper, we generalize the methodology of adversarial learning model in artificial intelligence and introduce a novel way to conveniently obtain sub-optimal and computationally hard trapdoors based on the automatic information theoretic search technique. The basic routine is constructing a generative architecture to search and discover a probabilistic reversible generator which can correctly encoding and decoding any input messages. The architecture includes a trapdoor generator built on a variational autoencoder (VAE) responsible for searching the appropriate trapdoors satisfying a maximum of entropy, a random message generator yielding random noise, and a dynamic classifier taking the results of the two generator. The evaluation of our construction shows the architecture satisfying basic indistinguishability of outputs under chosen-plaintext attack model (CPA) and high efficiency in generating cheap trapdoors.},

Initially, a cylindrical pin heatsink 3D model was built, and two datasets were collected from Ansys Icepak, considering five parameters. The models were trained using the first dataset, which included power ranges below 12.5W. Subsequently, the second dataset, with power ranges above 12.5W, was used to test the pre-trained models’ extrapolation abilities. The final results indicate that transfer learning, with the first three layers frozen, achieved the highest accuracy when compared to the other models using a limited new domain dataset. However, it is found that CGaNet shows good extrapolation performance when a new domain dataset is not available.},

  abstract={Shared parking optimizes available parking spaces by allowing private owners like in residential areas such as condominiums, hotels, apartments and private garage, to rent out their parking spots during times when they are unoccupied1. The concept of shared parking allows drivers – residents and visitors - avoid the long search for an unoccupied parking space while also allowing the space owners to earn passive income by renting out their owned spots during times when they’re not using them. This allows them to monetize an underutilized asset and promotes sharing economy strategy. Especially in big cities like in Metro Manila, motorists spent 24 minutes every day searching for parking on average2, where 37% of the cars in congested traffic were cruising for parking for an average of 20 minutes. This shared parking platform aims to mitigate the challenge of long search for an unoccupied residential parking space, limited parking facilities, and time-consuming property approval and payment process, providing drivers with more accessible and affordable options while reducing the daily time spent searching for parking. This platform will enable residential parking owners to rent out their parking spaces to residents/drivers who are in need of a convenient and well-priced parking space for a couple of hours, days or longer period. This case study aims to explore the development and implementation of this platform – both web and mobile – that leverages Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and user-centric design to revolutionize the parking experience, fostering a more sustainable and streamlined approach to sharing economy. The business model focuses on a commission-based revenue approach, ensuring revenue potential and scalability.},

  abstract={Recent deep generative models (DGMs) such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have shown their impressive ability in generating high-fidelity photorealistic images. Although looking appealing to human eyes, training a model on purely synthetic images for downstream image processing tasks like image classification often results in an undesired performance drop compared to training on real data. Previous works have demonstrated that enhancing a real dataset with synthetic images from DGMs can be beneficial. However, the improvements were subjected to certain circumstances and yet were not comparable to adding the same number of real images. In this work, we propose a new taxonomy to describe factors contributing to this commonly observed phenomenon and investigate it on the popular CIFAR-10 dataset. We hypothesize that the Content Gap accounts for a large portion of the performance drop when using synthetic images from DGM and propose strategies to better utilize them in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets showcase that our method outperforms baselines on downstream classification tasks both in case of training on synthetic only (Synthetic-to-Real) and training on a mix of real and synthetic data (Data Augmentation), particularly in the data-scarce scenario.},

  abstract={Fundamental frequency (F0) contours play a very important role in reflecting the emotion, identity, intension, and attitude of a speaker in samples of speech. In this paper, we adopted a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate artificial F0 contours of emotional speech. The GAN faces some limitations, however, in that it frequently generates undesired data because of unstable training, and it can repeatedly generate very similar or the same data, which is known as mode collapse. This study constructed a GAN-based generative model for F0 contours that can stably generate more-various F0 contours that fit the statistical characteristics of the training data. We tested the classification rate of four kinds of emotions in the F0 contours generated from five kinds of generative models. We also evaluated the averaged local density of the generated F0 contours to represent the variety of the generated F0 contours. Preliminary experiments confirmed the validity and effectiveness of the proposed generative model.},

  abstract={Personalized learning has significantly enhanced teaching practice through its development to cater to varied learning needs and in its full utilization of learner engagement. Traditional practice, in contrast, is limited by fixed content, minimum learner flexibility, and minimal immediate feedback. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduces a revolution through self-generated adaptive learning material such as customized tests, interactive simulations, and adaptive lesson plans. This article presents a systematic review on the use of Generative AI in education, synthesizing what has been published on its contributions to learning achievement based on empirical studies. Studies conducted by AI-powered platforms like Khan Academy's AI tutor and Duolingo's adaptive questions indicate a 26-38% boost in student engagement, a 34% boost in learning retention, and a 40% decrease in teacher workloads. Additionally, current evidence shows that adaptive learning models implemented using AI cut dropout rates by 22% and improved evaluation accuracy through live automated feedback. Despite these advantages, data confidentiality, algorithm bias, and material reliability concerns continue to exist. This paper fills this gap through the discussion of ethical AI platforms, the usage of open-sourced datasets in minimizing bias, and Explainable AI (XAI) as a means for transparency. Moreover, it explores hybrid AI-human models of education, scalability of AI-powered education in developing regions, and policy recommendations for affordable education. By integrating existing research, this paper also contributes to the body of knowledge on AI-facilitated personalized learning and its implications for learning in the future.},

  abstract={The increasing complexity of today’s industrial landscape poses a significant challenge for engineering education, creating a vast gap between the skills acquired by the students, the topics covered in the universities, and the skills required as per current industry demands. As the industry increasingly seeks to hire candidates with technical ability and the required skill set to solve real-world problems, traditional education and recruitment approaches struggle to keep up with the requirements. This misalignment is particularly evident in computer science and engineering, which is prone to rapid transformations, thus demanding an equally dynamic ecosystem. Generative AI (Gen AI), a subset of Artificial Intelligence, shows great promise in bridging the gaps between the three stakeholders: students, universities, and industry. We have leveraged Generative AI to attain the university curricula, align the student skills with the industry, and reshape the hiring and education process, which results in a well-collaborated ecosystem where students, universities, and industry are better aligned to serve each other’s interests.},

  year={2022},

  abstract={The increased demand for agricultural land and the more frequent occurrence of extreme weather conditions lead to increased greenhouses usage in agriculture. Greenhouses offer an efficient alternative to traditional agriculture as all environmental parameters are controlled, leading to a higher yield per land use. In older greenhouses, the different environmental factors are set manually, resulting in unfavorable climate conditions due to over- and undershoots of the factors. Optimizing environmental conditions, closed-loop control systems (CLCS) are used to reduce the susceptibility to over- and undershoots as well as to disturbance variables. The greenhouse actuators respond to various input values bringing changes to the environmental parameters. For controlling the actuators, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential to control the environmental parameters more accurately than a simple CLCS. With the help of predicting the influence of actuators regarding the greenhouse climate, AI-based climate systems might outperform CLCS systems and human experts. This paper provides an overview of the different architectures in which AI is used for controlling complex systems and discusses its potential for greenhouses. The results will show that AI offers the possibility for yield increase and resources saving.},

There's a lot happening in this field, so this chapter touches on key developments only, with a particular focus on: personalized advice for patients; detection of diseases; personalized treatment; and operational improvement. GenAI can help to reduce the administrative burden in healthcare by automating tasks such as medical coding, billing, routine enquiries, and notetaking. GenAI tools can empower individuals to take charge of their own healthcare, by engaging in discussions with healthcare chatbots about potential diagnoses and treatment options, and seeking medical help when needed. When a GenAI tool generates inaccurate or &#x201c;hallucinated&#x201d; content in a sector like marketing, it's probably rather embarrassing for the company using that content. GenAI can help to solve some of the biggest challenges facing global healthcare systems and make healthcare much more accessible and efficient.</p>},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming an integral part of everyday life. AI is no longer limited to advanced applications; it is embedded in applications and tools we use daily to streamline tasks and solve problems. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, are designed to help users make decisions, produce recommendations, and provide more personalized solutions to user inquiries. The immense reach these systems have had in such a short period has significantly impacted education, work, and interpersonal interactions. AI systems are only becoming more common, and it is imperative that developers work to address bias within them to promote fair use for all, not only the neurotypical. Research investigating the bias harbored by LLM platforms is particularly limited when it comes to addressing bias against individuals with autism. We applied inductive thematic analysis, followed by deductive thematic analysis, to analyze 34 scientific research papers gathered from two major academic databases: ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore. This method helped us learn more about the current empirical understanding of LLM bias as it relates to the context of autism. We found that bias within LLMs has the potential to harm individuals with autism who are looking for answers to problems for which LLMs have been postulated as a solution. LLMs also have the potential to reinforce negative stereotypes, leading users with autism who already face bias in daily life to continually struggle when faced with this new technological frontier.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that results in cognitive decline, and even dementia, in patients. To diagnose AD, a combination of tools is typically used, with structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) being one of them. sMRI images have mostly been used in supervised deep learning approaches, which requires large amounts of labeled data. To alleviate the need for labels, unsupervised deep learning could be used as an alternative. This study proposes an unsupervised model based on the deep convolutional generative adversarial network that performs anomaly detection on brain MRIs to diagnose AD. The model is able to yield an AUROC of 0.7951, a precision of 0.8228, a recall of 0.7386, and an accuracy of 74.44%.},

  abstract={As industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) play an increasingly pivotal role in the new industrial paradigm, their sustainability has become the current research focus. Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, also known as prognostics, is critically significant for the sustainability of ICPS. The prognostics involve utilizing process monitoring devices within ICPS to acquire real-time operational data. Based on the trends observed in the monitored data, the analysis predicts when potential system failures may occur. Accurate prognostics allow real-time monitoring of the system's health status, which enables early warning of possible faults and system reliability. The primary objective of this paper is to provide readers with a timely survey and review that reveals the current research status, development trends, and common challenges in the prognostics domain within ICPS. From the perspective of artificial intelligence (AI), the paper comprehensively reviews predictive approaches based on stochastic process, machine learning, and their hybrid applications. Through a comprehensive comparison of existing approaches, the paper delves into the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. Furthermore, facing some cutting-edge issues in existing RUL prediction approaches for ICPS, this paper analyzes some pioneering investigations that have achieved great results. Finally, the paper explores the opportunities and challenges of prognostics from the perspective of artificial intelligence, which aims to drive the sustainability of ICPS.},

  abstract={Generative adversarial network (GAN) has been extensively applied in many fields since it was first proposed in 2014. There have been ongoing attempts at improving the model and developing its extensions. The basic idea behind GAN stems from the two-player zero-sum game. Composed of a generator and a discriminator, GAN is trained through a “battle” between the two networks, where the generator tries to fool the discriminator. In contrast, the discriminator tries not to be deceived. The purpose is to estimate the potential distribution of data samples and generate new data samples. GAN is currently being studied in computer vision, language processing, and information security and is still far from reaching its potential. Since there are limited existing resources on GAN reviews, this paper provides a comprehensive review of a few of the most important GAN variants. We divided the variants into three categories: foundation, extension, and advanced, gave an overview of each architecture, and analyzed their advantages and disadvantages. We also summarized some of the most popular applications of GAN, and finally, we brought up the problems of GAN-based architectures that have yet to be solved and pointed out the future direction of GAN research and development.},

  abstract={As the interaction of light with the Earth surface is very complex, spectral pixels are composed of sophisticated mixtures of distinct substances. The parameters of the estimated models are difficult to set. In this paper, we first propose a spatial-spectral conditional generative adversarial networks (scGANs) method to solve this problem, based on the following assumptions: the unmixing process from pixels to abundance can be viewed as a transformation of two modalities with an intrinsic specific relationship. The method learns the manifold structure of the hyperspectral data using an adversarial strategy, inputting pixels blocks with spatial information to generate the abundance of the central pixels. Then, we proposed superpixel segmentation and random splitting method to synthesize data with spatial structure. Finally, the proposed scGANs method is evaluated using synthetic data and real hyperspectral data, and compared to several state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method outperforms all the comparison methods in the experiments.},

  abstract={Introducing a data-driven Self-Awareness (SA) module in Cognitive Radio (CR) can support the system to establish secure networks against various attacks from malicious users. Such users can manipulate the radio spectrum in order to make the CR learn wrong behaviours and take mistaken actions. A basic SA module includes the ability to learn generative models and detect abnormalities inside the radio spectrum. In this work, we propose and implement Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Abnormality Detection techniques at the physical (PHY)-layer in CR enabled by learning Generative Models. Specifically, two real-world practical applications related to different data dimensionality and sampling rates are presented. The first application implements the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (C-GAN) investigated on generalized state vectors extracted from spectrum representation samples to study the dynamic behaviour of the wideband signal. While the second application is based on learning a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model from a generalized state vector which contains sub-bands information extracted from the radio spectrum. Results show that both of the proposed methods are capable of detecting abnormal signals in the spectrum and pave the road towards Self-Aware radio.},

  abstract={Anomaly detection in network traffic is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, aiming to identify abnormal behaviors indicative of potential security threats. In recent years, advancements in AI techniques have led to the exploration of innovative approaches for enhancing anomaly detection capabilities. This study introduces a novel methodology leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for anomaly detection in network traffic data, contributing to the advancement of AI cybersecurity. The proposed approach integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature selection, allowing for the extraction of essential network traffic patterns while reducing dimensionality. Subsequently, GANs are employed to learn the underlying distribution of normal network traffic and generate synthetic samples for anomaly detection. This framework offers a holistic solution that combines the strengths of feature selection and generative modeling to effectively discern anomalous activities from normal network behaviors. The methodology is evaluated using a comprehensive dataset collected from Kaggle, comprising diverse network traffic records. Results demonstrate the superior performance of the PCA-GAN method compared to existing techniques, achieving high accuracy and robust detection of anomalies in network traffic. The integration of PCA for dimensionality reduction and GANs for generative modeling proves to be effective in enhancing cybersecurity measures, providing a promising solution for detecting and mitigating security threats in network infrastructures. With an accuracy of around 99.12%, the suggested method which uses Python software outperforms other existing techniques like CNN-GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-LSTM, and Conv-LSTM by 1.49%. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts in leveraging AI technologies for bolstering cybersecurity defenses and safeguarding critical systems against malicious activities.},

  abstract={Cancer is an overarching term encompassing over number of distinct diseases characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells. These diseases occur when abnormal cells proliferate uncontrollably, exceeding their usual boundaries to invade adjacent body structures and potentially disseminate to distant organs. It stands as a noteworthy global health concern, prompting ongoing research aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of its root causes, devising more effective treatments and refining early detection methods. Advancements in fields like genomics, immunology and artificial intelligence are contributing to our comprehension of cancer and the creation of innovative approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Early detection and improvements in cancer therapy have intensified survival rates for many cancer types, yet it continues to position a substantial health challenge worldwide. Deep learning has emerged as an effective tool in the cancer diagnosis, promising enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and speed in various aspects of cancer assessment. Artificial intelligence algorithms that use the deep learning method are effective at analyzing medical imaging like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), X-radiation images, Computerized Tomography (CT) scans, and to identify and classify malignant anomalies. Moreover, deep learning can be connected to extract quantitative features from medical images, a discipline known as radiomics, which yields valuable insights for characterizing tumors and forecasting their prognosis. Extending the possibility, innovative technologies like Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) assumes a pivotal role in the domain of cancer diagnosis by producing synthetic data, images, or simulations that lend invaluable support to various features of cancer detection and analysis. These technologies find application across the spectrum of cancer related tasks, spanning detection, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment optimization, drug discovery and patient care. This research study discovers the character of Generative Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms in cancer prediction, covering their current applications, limitations, and future prospects.},

  abstract={Serious games are videogames whose purpose goes beyond mere entertainment. However, serious games use in mainstream education is still limited. The development of serious games is an expensive and complex process that requires the participation of different experts (e.g. domain, educators, graphic artists, and programmers). We consider that new generative AI techniques can help in the prototyping of serious games by reducing and automating some of the processes involved. There is increasing evidence that generative AI techniques such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot can increase the productivity of writing or coding tasks respectively. In our case, both prototyping and teaching serious games are complex because of the number and diversity of tasks involved and we are currently investigating whether AI techniques can be used to improve and simplify the process. For example, ChatGPT could support the process of creating the game narrative, and other systems such as Stable Diffusion could ease the creation of some of the graphics resources (e.g., for creating more cohesive and coherent backgrounds). Automating some of the costlier processes of game prototyping can contribute to creating better products by allowing the playtesting of different options for more effective games. As the field of generative AI is in continuous change, this paper presents a working methodology to simplify the development of serious games, that has been instantiated with concrete tools. This working methodology has been piloted effectively by one student from a Master of Design for the development of a serious game and will be tested in a serious games development course. In the article we also explore how these AI techniques can be combined with a game authoring environment such as uAdventure to systematize the development of serious games. The use of Generative AI offers great potential for improving the development of serious games and needs to be further researched alongside its applications for game-based learning education.},

  abstract={The widespread use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools in higher education, particularly among university students, has raised ethical concerns regarding unintentional plagiarism. Although these tools offer benefits such as time-saving and improved quality, with over 100 available applications, they may inadvertently include borrowed content, posing challenges to academic integrity. Ethical concerns arise within educational institutions, faculty, and integrity committees, complicating evaluations of originality. To address these concerns, universities must establish clear guidelines and educational programs for responsible use of GenAI applications. Educators need to remain current with the latest AI technologies, become proficient in their use, and utilize advanced techniques to teach students how to use them appropriately. This mixed-methods study examines undergraduate engineering students' understanding of GenAI, its usage and ethical implications. The findings demonstrate that ChatGPT is the most popular GenAI application among the students, but also highlight the professors' unfavorable attitudes towards GenAI. The study endeavors to improve understanding of perspectives on GenAI in higher education, facilitating responsible technology integration in classrooms and fostering students' ethical growth. The investigation provides valuable insights for professors, institutions, and research communities engaged in student development and educational advancement.

  abstract={The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including large language models (LLMs), has brought transformative changes to various fields. However, deploying such advanced models on mobile and edge devices remains challenging due to their high computational, memory, communication, and energy requirements. To address these challenges, we propose a model-centric framework for democratizing generative AI deployment on mobile and edge networks. First, we comprehensively review key compact model strategies, such as quantization, model pruning, and knowledge distillation, and present key performance metrics to optimize generative AI for mobile deployment. Next, we provide a focused review of mobile and edge networks, emphasizing the specific challenges and requirements of these environments. We further conduct a case study demonstrating the effectiveness of these strategies by deploying LLMs on real mobile edge devices. Experimental results highlight the practicality of democratized LLMs, with significant improvements in generalization accuracy, hallucination rate, accessibility, and resource consumption. Finally, we discuss potential research directions to further advance the deployment of generative AI in resource-constrained environments.},

  abstract={Current studies for brain-muscle modulation often analyze selected properties in electrophysiological signals, leading to a partial understanding. This article proposes a cross-modal generative model that converts brain activities measured by electroencephalography (EEG) to corresponding muscular responses recorded by electromyography (EMG). Examining the generation process in the model highlights how the motor cue, representing implicit motor information hidden within brain activities, modulates the interaction between brain and muscle systems. The proposed model employs a two-stage generation process to bridge the semantic gap in cross-modal signals. Initially, the shared movement-related information between EEG and EMG signals is extracted using a contrastive learning framework. These shared representations act as conditional vectors in the subsequent EMG generation stage based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Experiments on a self-collected multimodal electrophysiological signal data set show the algorithm’s superiority over existing time series generative methods in cross-modal EMG generation. Further insights derived from the model’s inference process underscore the brain’s strategy for muscle control during movements. This research provides a data-driven approach for the neuroscience community, offering a comprehensive perspective of brain-muscular modulation.},

  abstract={Deep learning and computer vision have especially improved medical diagnostics in ophthalmology and other fields. Eye diseases include cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, and normal problems offer major challenges considering their frequency and impact on vision health. Conventional diagnosis methods rely on the subj ective and prone-to-error manual examination that ophthalmologists provide. This work investigates the use of a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture, Fine Tuned EfficientN etB3, for the automated categorization of various eye illnesses. We use a large collection of 3,424 high-quality retinal pictures taken from several repositories and annotated by professionals. We raise the quality of the dataset by using rigorous preprocessing and augmentation techniques. Fine-tuned via transfer learning, the EfficientN etB3 model shows great performance with a 94% general accuracy. Evaluations of precision, recall and F l-score show the consistency of the model across several disease diagnoses. Particularly in underdeveloped areas, the model's exceptional accuracy and efficiency emphasize its capacity to improve clinical operations, raise diagnosis accuracy, and give access to professional eye care. Our efforts provide scalable solutions for early and accurate eye disease diagnosis, therefore advancing the expanding field of artificial intelligence-driven medical diagnostics.},

  abstract={The Customized Face Generator (CFG) emerges as a ground-breaking response to a substantial challenge in the rapidly developing fields of computer graphics and artificial intelligence. Background issues for this study include the need to address ethical issues related to bias and representation in these digital identities as well as the growing desire for realistic and adaptable human faces across a range of industries, from entertainment to digital marketing. The design and development of a system that effortlessly blends diversity, realism, and personalization while preserving ethical standards is the main issue this research attempts to solve. It intends to provide users with the tools to create distinctive faces while upholding individual identities and avoiding damaging prejudices in generated content. The CFG’s ability to transform digital representation is its primary significance. It allows users to generate a variety of lifelike faces by utilizing cutting-edge deep learning techniques like GANs and VAEs, making for more engaging digital experiences and fostering greater individual expression. Modern technologies and ethical considerations are incorporated into the study approach. The architecture of the CFG is made to gradually add layers of complexity to faces as they are generated, giving them a more realistic appearance. In order to prevent offensive content, an easy-to-use customizing interface is created. The key result of from this research project includes a face creation system that is extremely adjustable and morally upright. The usefulness of the CFG is shown through quantitative metrics assessing diversity, realism, and user happiness together with qualitative evaluations. The CFG has enormous global relevance. It opens up a new level of inclusion and personalization in digital settings, having an impact on fields that depend on visual communication. This study adds to the ongoing conversation around moral AI and lays out a plan for responsible innovation, where technology meets both practical needs and social conscience.},

Successfully integrating AI into marketing requires broader organizational alignment. The chapter shows how AI&#x2010;enhanced marketing operations link to other functions and promote the establishment of a cohesive, informed, and flexible business environment. The successful integration of AI into marketing requires a collaborative effort across all levels of an organization. Marketers may find the AI&#x2010;related changes even more profound, lasting, and potentially career&#x2010;altering than the previous shifts in communications and customer connections. Marketing leaders can take actions in a similar fashion to the federal government's approach to implementing and governing the use of AI. In the AI&#x2010;driven era, marketing functions must not only adapt to new technologies but also redefine roles and workflows to optimize collaboration between human teams and AI copilots. One of the drivers limiting AI adoption is organizational inertia and cultural barriers.</p>},

  abstract={Recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning in general have demonstrated remarkable performances in many tasks, from image processing to natural language processing, especially with the advent of deep learning (DL). Along with research progress, they have encroached upon many different fields and disciplines. Some of them require high level of accountability and thus transparency, for example, the medical sector. Explanations for machine decisions and predictions are thus needed to justify their reliability. This requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the blackbox nature of the DL is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly understood. We provide a review on interpretabilities suggested by different research works and categorize them. The different categories show different dimensions in interpretability research, from approaches that provide “obviously” interpretable information to the studies of complex patterns. By applying the same categorization to interpretability in medical research, it is hoped that: 1) clinicians and practitioners can subsequently approach these methods with caution; 2) insight into interpretability will be born with more considerations for medical practices; and 3) initiatives to push forward data-based, mathematically grounded, and technically grounded medical education are encouraged.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={141-146},
  abstract={Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) is a dual-energy mammographic technique that improves lesion visibility through the administration of an iodinated contrast agent. It acquires both a low-energy image, comparable to standard mammography, and a high-energy image, which are then combined to produce a dual-energy subtracted image highlighting lesion contrast enhancement. While CESM offers superior diagnostic accuracy compared to standard mammography, its use entails higher radiation exposure and potential side effects associated with the contrast medium. To address these limitations, we propose Seg-CycleGAN, a generative deep learning framework for Virtual Contrast Enhancement in CESM. The model synthesizes high-fidelity dual-energy subtracted images from low-energy images, leveraging lesion segmentation maps to guide the generative process and improve lesion reconstruction. Building upon the standard CycleGAN architecture, Seg-CycleGAN introduces localized loss terms focused on lesion areas, enhancing the synthesis of diagnostically relevant regions. Experiments on the CESM@UCBM dataset demonstrate that Seg-CycleGAN outperforms the baseline in terms of PSNR and SSIM, while maintaining competitive MSE and VIF. Qualitative evaluations further confirm improved lesion fidelity in the generated images. These results suggest that segmentation-aware generative models offer a viable pathway toward contrast-free CESM alternatives.},

  abstract={Individually reinforcing the robustness of a single deep learning model only gives limited security guarantees especially when facing adversarial examples. In this article, we propose DeSVig, a decentralized swift vigilance framework to identify adversarial attacks in an industrial artificial intelligence systems (IAISs), which enables IAISs to correct the mistake in a few seconds. The DeSVig is highly decentralized, which improves the effectiveness of recognizing abnormal inputs. We try to overcome the challenges on ultralow latency caused by dynamics in industries using peculiarly designated mobile edge computing and generative adversarial networks. The most important advantage of our work is that it can significantly reduce the failure risks of being deceived by adversarial examples, which is critical for safety-prioritized and delay-sensitive environments. In our experiments, adversarial examples of industrial electronic components are generated by several classical attacking models. Experimental results demonstrate that the DeSVig is more robust, efficient, and scalable than some state-of-art defenses.},

  abstract={The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in visual art creation has unlocked new dimensions in creativity, automation, and personalized artistic expression. Conventional methods of generating art—typically based on rule-based systems or fixed templates—fail to engage the complexity, emotional depth, and stylistic variety that typify contemporary works of art. These existing drawbacks commonly lead to stiff and dull outputs that never manage to express rich artistic intent. To solve this aforementioned drawback, the current research investigates a hybrid AI strategy that exploits the strengths of StyleGAN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. In the suggested framework StyleGAN, is utilized to produce high-resolution and visually appealing visual artworks through training with a curated collection of classical and modern works. The latent vectors from the output are further analyzed by LSTM networks to add sequential and thematic aspects, adding contextual and emotional richness to the created work of art. The system was strictly tested using both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The system attained an FID score of 8.2 and a user satisfaction rate of 96% and has proven effective in creating visually engaging and emotionally appealing AI-generated pieces of art.},

  abstract={The aim of this research paper is to present a novel approach of using Relevance Generative Answering (RGA) in the trending field of Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The paradigm shift in the RAG system by the introduction of Agentic RAG has opened a new research paradigm. The major issue of hallucination is overcome with the use of a traditional RAG system with some limitations like accuracy and relevance, lack of reasoning, the lost in the middle problem, etc. The Agentic RAG system attempts to address a few of these limitations. However, interpreting results based on the user's intent remains a significant area of research. This research aimed to understand user intent by introducing relevance detection block in the proposed architecture. Different performance metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, relevance, latency are used to validate the proposed approach. The results presented in this research reveal that the performance of the proposed system is much more relevant compared to agentic RAG system. For context and intent specific applications proposed framework suits well.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools are rapidly transforming mathematics education by enabling automated problem generation, dynamic visualizations, and adaptive learning experiences. This study presents an empirical study on incorporating MATH41 into a 15-week pre-service teacher preparation course for mathematics majors. Twenty-four participants learned to create parameterized math problems, generate vector graphics. Following guided training, each participant designed and micro-taught a 20-minute lesson incorporating MATH41-generated resources. Reflection journals and final lesson plans were analyzed thematically, while 20 participants completed a self-assessment survey on lesson design competency. Results reveal that the automated problem generation capabilities motivated pre-service teachers to explore a broader range of instructional strategies, including personalized tasks and diverse problem variants. Reflection data indicate that while integrating AI tools can significantly boost confidence and creativity in lesson planning, careful pedagogical alignment remains essential to avoid superficial learning. Participants underscored the importance of maintaining teacher oversight—especially when adapting AI-generated problems for particular learner needs. Additionally, their post-course self-assessments showed high confidence in digital tool integration, yet they acknowledged that anticipating student misconceptions requires further field experience. Overall, this study contributes to understanding how teacher education programs can enhance lesson design competencies via structured AI tool integration. It also highlights the critical role of reflective practice in ensuring that automated content creation fosters deeper instructional effectiveness rather than uncritical AI dependency.},

  abstract={During the last few years the Indian stock market has witnessed an overwhelmed participation of new investors and the 42 lakh DEMAT Account openings in 2023 quoted by Economic Times is a prime evidence of that. Considering the rising inclination of Euphoria towards the stock market, arming oneself with the knowledge of technical analysis has become the need of the hour. In intraday and Swing Trading, taking a right entry and exit is the most crucial thing in order to make agood amount of profit and that ultimately showcases the importance of identifying a trend reversal. One of the most popular indicator for identifying a trend reversal is Fibonacci Retracement. Fibonacci Retracement is based on Fibonacci sequence and it helps a trader in plotting the support and resistance levels. Purpose and Focus - There are many research papers explaining how Fibonacci retracement works and how to use that but there is no literature that showcases the empirical evidence that demonstrates the accuracy of Fibonacci retracement in identifying the trend reversals. Back testing of one small cap, mid cap and large cap stock listed on NSE will be done on different time frames using Artificial Intelligence and trading view to test the accuracy and effectiveness of Fibonacci retracement.},

  abstract={Recently, with the advent of the Internet of everything and 5G network, the amount of data generated by various edge scenarios such as autonomous vehicles, smart industry, 4K/8K, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), etc., has greatly exploded. All these trends significantly brought real-time, hardware dependence, low power consumption, and security requirements to the facilities, and rapidly popularized edge computing. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) workloads also changed the computing paradigm from cloud services to mobile applications dramatically. Different from wide deployment and sufficient study of AI in the cloud or mobile platforms, AI workload performance and their resource impact on edges have not been well understood yet. There lacks an in-depth analysis and comparison of their advantages, limitations, performance, and resource consumptions in an edge environment. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study of representative AI workloads on edge platforms. We first conduct a summary of modern edge hardware and popular AI workloads. Then we quantitatively evaluate three categories (i.e., classification, image-to-image, and segmentation) of the most popular and widely used AI applications in realistic edge environments based on Raspberry Pi, Nvidia TX2, etc. We find that interaction between hardware and neural network models incurs non-negligible impact and overhead on AI workloads at edges. Our experiments show that performance variation and difference in resource footprint limit availability of certain types of workloads and their algorithms for edge platforms, and users need to select appropriate workload, model, and algorithm based on requirements and characteristics of edge environments.},

  abstract={This study presents an innovative approach for urban functional zoning and planning based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Utilizing multi-modal remote sensing data and geographic information, this research proposes a deep learning framework to accurately classify and segment urban functional areas. The proposed method leverages a Transformer-based Spatio-Temporal Fusion Network (TBST) that integrates high-resolution satellite imagery and time-series population data. The TBST model comprises two feature extraction branches, ResMixer and PDNet, which respectively handle spatial and temporal features, followed by a Transformer-based adaptive fusion layer to enhance the extraction of informal settlements in urban areas. Experimental results demonstrate that the multimodal data fusion significantly improves the accuracy of urban functional area classification, achieving superior performance metrics compared to single-modal approaches. This method holds significant potential for advancing smart city planning by providing precise and up-to-date spatial distribution information, thus supporting urban policy-making and sustainable development.},

  abstract={Fuzzing is a popular technique for finding soft-ware vulnerabilities. Despite their success, the state-of-art fuzzers will inevitably produce a large number of low-quality inputs. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) based selection strategies have reported promising results. However, the existing ML-based fuzzers are limited by the lack of training data. Because the mutation strategy of fuzzing can not effectively generate useful input, it is prohibitively expensive to collect enough inputs to train models. In this paper, propose a generative adversarial networks based solution to generate a large number of inputs to solve the problem of insufficient data. We implement the proposal in the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), and the experimental results show that it can find more crashes at the same time compared with the original AFL.},

  abstract={From the past few years, Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have gained more and more interest of researchers of Artificial Intelligence and this is only due to the reliability on huge amount of data, well designed network architectures and smart training techniques because of which they produce highly realistic pieces of content of images, texts and sounds. The inspirational idea of working in GANs has been derived from game theory, named as the zero-sum game. GANs consist of two components-a generator as well as a discriminator both of which act like two players of the game playing in opposition with each other. This paper focuses on the basic theory and principle mechanism of GANs. Next, the paper discusses few variants based on architecture as well as loss functions of some kinds. Finally, the last section of paper presents few other variants of GANs which are implemented in the field of computer vision and other real world problems. It is found that this area has a wider scope in terms of virtual real interaction and integration along with parallel learning. So it is considered as new implementation area for GANs in the coming future.},

  abstract={Introduction: The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and design is gaining significant attention among professional communication researchers. Although challenges in designing with and for AI have been generally investigated, current systematic literature reviews have neglected to consider the tensions between AI and human designers during design work and how that work is impacted. Our study extends previous work by offering a more nuanced understanding of how AI affects designers’ work, thought processes, and solutions. Research methodology: Using the PRISMA framework, we conducted a systematic review of 44 articles specifically addressing tensions between human designers and AI in design work. We employed a hybrid inductive/deductive thematic analysis approach, using Miro for remote qualitative analysis. Results and discussion: Our thematic analysis reveals four main themes that encapsulate the multifaceted impact of AI on design practice: 1. reframing design roles and work, 2. human-AI-(human) interaction and collaboration, 3. cognitive expansion and critical reflection, and 4. limitations and risks of AI. These themes collectively offer insights into the multifaceted nature of AI’s impact on human designers in this new paradigm of practice. Conclusions and further research: This review has significant implications for researchers and practitioners in design. It reflects the current complexities of integrating AI into design processes while preserving human creativity, intuition, and agency. We further identify research gaps and suggest directions for future research and practice in design domains.},

  abstract={As artificial intelligence tools like GitHub Copilot become more integrated into software development workflows, they are transforming how architects approach modern software design. Although enterprises are exploring the potential of GenAl tools to improve developer productivity, limited research exists on their impact on the role of software architects. Traditionally, architects use various tools to create architectural blueprints, including Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams, component diagrams, deployment diagrams, activity diagrams, and state diagrams, to name a few. Many of these diagrams follow repetitive patterns that could be automated with well-defined contexts. This paper examines Copilot's role in supporting architects through various stages of architectural development, evaluating how closely Copilot-generated outputs align with established architectural principles. By analyzing deviations, the study discusses how refined prompts can yield more accurate results. This research ultimately seeks to determine Copilot's potential to enhance productivity, ensure consistency, and support architectural decision-making, while offering insights into best practices for integrating AI into modern software architecture.},

  abstract={Synthesis of digital artifacts conditioned on user prompts has become an important paradigm facilitating an explosion of use cases with generative AI. However, such models often fail to connect the generated outputs and desired target concepts/preferences implied by the prompts. Current research addressing this limitation has largely focused on enhancing the prompts before output generation or improving the model’s performance up front. In contrast, this paper conceptualizes prompt evolution, imparting evolutionary selection pressure and variation during the generative process to produce multiple outputs that satisfy the target concepts/preferences better. We propose a multi-objective instantiation of this broader idea that uses a multi-label image classifier-guided approach. The predicted labels from the classifiers serve as multiple objectives to optimize, with the aim of producing diversified images that meet user preferences. A novelty of our evolutionary algorithm is that the pre-trained generative model gives us implicit mutation operations, leveraging the model’s stochastic generative capability to automate the creation of Pareto-optimized images more faithful to user preferences.},

  abstract={Software assistants have significantly impacted software development for both practitioners and students, particularly in capstone projects. The effectiveness of these tools varies based on their knowledge sources; assistants with localized domain-specific knowledge may have limitations, while tools, such as ChatGPT, using broad datasets, might offer recommendations that do not always match the specific objectives of a capstone course. Addressing a gap in current educational technology, this article introduces an AI Knowledge Assistant specifically designed to overcome the limitations of the existing tools by enhancing the quality and relevance of large language models (LLMs). It achieves this through the innovative integration of contextual knowledge from a local “lessons learned” database tailored to the capstone course. We conducted a study with 150 students using the assistant during their capstone course. Integrated into the Kanban project tracking system, the assistant offered recommendations using different strategies: direct searches in the lessons learned database, direct queries to a generative pretrained transformers (GPT) model, query enrichment with lessons learned before submission to GPT and large language model meta AI (LLaMa) models, and query enhancement with Stack Overflow data before GPT processing. Survey results underscored a strong preference among students for direct LLM queries and those enriched with local repository insights, highlighting the assistant's practical value. Furthermore, our linguistic analysis conclusively demonstrated that texts generated by the LLM closely mirrored the linguistic standards and topical relevance of university course requirements. This alignment not only fosters a deeper understanding of course content but also significantly enhances the material's applicability to real-world scenarios.},

  abstract={In this paper, NUTRIC AI is explained as a cutting-edge AI-assisted personal nutrition advisory system that provides personalized dietary guidelines through the review of individual clinical histories, current medical records, and AI-assisted meal planning. Real-time food recognition is performed by the system via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Forecasting of Dietary Patterns is achieved using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks on past records of health information. Generative Networks are utilized to design personalized meal plans as per the specified dietary needs. For transparency and user confidence induction, the system utilizes Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, i.e., SHAP, to incorporate interpretability in its recommendations. Experimental trials depict substantial gains at a 95% accurate meal planning rate and a 92% user acceptance rate, better than existing available nutrition management platforms. The real-time food scoring system, user-specific dietary advice tailored to a user's own health record, and AI-facilitated chatbot interface are the distinguishing strengths of NUTRIC AI. The convergence of these three features places NUTRIC AI at the forefront of the art of personalized nutritional management.},

  abstract={The unsupervised image translation is the core task of computer image processing, spanning a variety of real-world application scenarios, and constitutes an important branch of computer vision research orientations. In image translation tasks with significant geometric variations, conventional image translation algorithms have led to the generation of low-quality images due to unstable training. To address this matter, this paper proposes an unsupervised image translation method that combines a Self-Attention module. Specifically, first, the proposed model constructs the Generative Self-Attention Module and embeds it between the residual blocks and up-sampling in the generator, while inserting it in the discriminator before down-sampling. Then, the number of residual blocks is modified. Finally, a residual attention mechanism is introduced in the discriminator, which helps to propagate the features further. In particular, the model enhances the ability of the generator to extract deeper features at the central pixels, further improving the ability to transform the spatial details of the image and guiding the generator to generate more realistic images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model has preferable superiority and performance to the existing unsupervised image translation models.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize teaching and learning applications. This article examines the word cloud, a toolkit often used to scaffold teaching and learning for reflection, critical thinking, and content learning. Addressing the issues in traditional word clouds, semantic word clouds have been developed but they are technically challenging to develop and still problematic. However, generative AI has the potential to develop efficient, accurate, creative, and accessible word clouds. Three different methods representing three major approaches of word cloud generation were developed, implemented, and user evaluated—traditional (baseline), semantic (natural language processing enhanced), and generative AI (generative pretrained transformer based)—in two different language contexts—Chinese (China case) and English (Singapore case). The findings of the study show the technical robustness of the methods, as well as provide key pedagogical insights from the user perspective of instructors of higher education courses in China and Singapore. Implications to the design of word clouds and their application in teaching and learning are discussed.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a revolutionary innovation in machine learning that enables the generation of artificial data. Artificial data synthesis is valuable especially in the medical field where it is difficult to collect and annotate real data due to privacy issues, limited access to experts, and cost. While adversarial training has led to significant breakthroughs in the computer vision field, biomedical research has not yet fully exploited the capabilities of generative models for data generation, and for more complex tasks such as biosignal modality transfer. We present a broad analysis on adversarial learning on biosignal data. Our study is the first in the machine learning community to focus on synthesizing 1D biosignal data using adversarial models. We consider three types of deep generative adversarial networks: a classical GAN, an adversarial AE, and a modality transfer GAN; individually designed for biosignal synthesis and modality transfer purposes. We evaluate these methods on multiple datasets for different biosignal modalites, including phonocardiogram (PCG), electrocardiogram (ECG), vectorcardiogram and 12-lead electrocardiogram. We follow subject-independent evaluation protocols, by evaluating the proposed models' performance on completely unseen data to demonstrate generalizability. We achieve superior results in generating biosignals, specifically in conditional generation, by synthesizing realistic samples while preserving domain-relevant characteristics. We also demonstrate insightful results in biosignal modality transfer that can generate expanded representations from fewer input-leads, ultimately making the clinical monitoring setting more convenient for the patient. Furthermore our longer duration ECGs generated, maintain clear ECG rhythmic regions, which has been proven using ad-hoc segmentation models.},

  abstract={GenerativeAdversarial Networks (GAN) is currently one of the hottest subjects in the field of Artificial Intelligence; it has a significant impact on the development of generative models. The excellence of GAN is that it is based on zero-sum game theory and has a generator as well as a discriminator that optimize each other and finally receive the optimal result. In recent years, many different types of GAN optimization models have emerged, which can be classified by the different structure of their generators and discriminators. Since most of the experiments of the models are conducted on the datasets of MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10, etc., the performance of each model on those datasets is evaluated. Then some of the applications and the methods of optimizing the models of GAN are explained. Finally, we propose challenges that GAN faces and the prospect of GAN.},

  abstract={Along with the development of deep learning, the research of computer vision has attracted much attention in recent years. Among various research topics, image translation is quite a hot one, which aims to translate an image into another domain according to the exact application purpose. In this paper, we present a novel capsule based conditional generative adversarial network that can automatically synthesize the image with realistic and aesthetically pleasing effect from a given image. By designing the capsule blocks in both the generator and discriminator and a novel multi-way optimization function, our framework can generate more realistic images than other frameworks. For the specific application, effect rendering, an effective line preservation loss is well designed and helps the framework to focus the synthesis of the texture around the lines, which not only improves the local line visual effect, but also enhance the global lighting effect around the lines. The experiments show that our improvement is effective and provides significant help to the overall framework. Our framework is tested on the effect rendering dataset and we compare our approach with multiple state-of-the-art methods. We achieved the best results.},

  abstract={Tropical cyclones (TCs) that develop in the Arabian Sea or the Bay of Bengal pose a serious threat to the North Indian Ocean (NIO). The main agency in charge of monitoring tropical cyclones in the NIO is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which also offers early warnings in accordance with the TC’s Intensity. The present paper has addressed the state of intensity estimation for thermal currents (TCs) worldwide, with a focus on the NIO region. Conventionally, the Dvorak technique and its various versions are being used for satellite images to detect the intensity of TCs manually; however, a lot of efforts have been invested to develop artificial intelligence based alternatives for this. The paper examines the importance of Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) for estimating the intensity of TCs and their advantages over satellite images. The performance of the current IMD system is also highlighted in this paper. The average annual absolute intensity forecast skill for TCs in the period of 2013 to 2023 has been reported to be 74.95%. Further, the paper outlines existing challenges in the present system of intensity estimation for TCs. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions and underscores the critical need for an efficient artificial intelligence-based system for better intensity estimation of TCs.},

  abstract={Current technological advancements in Information Technology are closely linked to Generative Artificial Intelligence, enabling the automation of complex tasks such as generating documents, images, videos, audio, and actions. As such tasks can save much human labor and resources, diverse industries are trying to adopt this technology. However, developing a product utilizing Generative AI is a challenging task, partly because it is a new technology and many users are not familiar with it yet. This paper’s primary goal is to find a better way to design Generative AI systems, especially from the Human-Computer Interaction perspective. To begin, we propose a taxonomy for Generative AI systems based on their modality, such as text-based, image-based, audio-based, and multi-modal-based systems, and then evaluate them in terms of their usability, because their functionalities should be aligned with the User Interface (UI), leading to a better User Experience (UX). We survey important trends in this area and introduce future applications by touching upon the issue of explainable AI. Although Generative AI has a bright future, it faces formidable challenges in our industries and society. It is hoped that the taxonomy and research findings presented here will be a useful framework for future research in Generative AI systems and their UI/UX.},

  abstract={Design thinking (DT), widely recognized as a structured method for fostering creativity and innovation, has gained significant traction in research and practice across various disciplines. However, with the rise of disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), DT practices are gradually evolving, reshaping the innovation process. This study investigates the effectiveness of integrating generative AI into a product design thinking activity, employing a single-group pretest-posttest design (i.e., without a control group). The time interval between pretest and posttest measurements was four hours, coinciding with the duration of the DT activity. Conducted in a chemical engineering course at a private university in central Mexico, the research tasked nine students of average academic performance with designing a new beverage. Over a four-hour session, students used AI tools-ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini-at various stages of the design process, including empathy mapping, need statements, idea classification, hills writing, and storyboarding. Several multidimensional constructs were measured using self-report questionnaires to assess the key attributes that DT stimulates: perceptions of creative self-efficacy, design thinking mindset, and empathy. Additionally, the study explored students' views on the usefulness of generative AI and their intention to use such tools. It was hypothesized that post-test scores for each construct would increase. The analysis involved two phases: first, psychometric indicators (alpha reliability) were obtained; second, a statistical approach for assessing individual change was applied, precisely the standardized individual difference (SID). The SID was set at a nominal level of 0.80 (right tail of the normal distribution). Scores with unacceptable measurement error (alpha <. 60) were excluded from the primary analysis. The results revealed a significant increase in students' perceived usefulness of AI between pre- and post-experiment measurements, with a moderate improvement in affective empathy. Other constructs also showed consistent, though modest, post-test score increases. However, only a few participants exceeded the SID threshold, indicating individual variations in response to the intervention. These preliminary findings highlight AI's potential to enhance student creativity through idea generation and expand their consideration of the end user in product design. The results provide valuable insights and recommendations for integrating AI into innovation-driven projects using the design thinking approach and implementing a single-group pretest-posttest design with short time intervals.},
