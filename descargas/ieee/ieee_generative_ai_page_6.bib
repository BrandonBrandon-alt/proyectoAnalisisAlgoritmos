  abstract={Technology development has brought us to a time when generative AI, such as Stable Diffusion in LeonardoAI, can make the work of a character designer easier. Generative AI can accelerate the character design process, especially at the empathy stage, studying the visual preferences of the target audience and exploring alternative visual styles. In a case study of designing an animated series as content to accompany meals for people aged 25-30 years who like to watch movies while eating, the authors try to shorten the character design process using LeonardoAI. The authors try to understand the visual preferences of the target audience using a quantitative method, using a questionnaire filled with questions about the images generated by LeonardoAI. The questionnaire results became the basis for the character design ideas for the animated series ‘Genset Gang’ using keywords to develop the character's visuals. The authors found that using LeonardoAI can speed up the character design process because it can produce many images quickly, although its use has challenges. After all, LeonardoAI relies heavily on the character designer's ability to translate his ideas into prompt text and how the instruction code is successfully written.},

  abstract={This work aims to explore the innovative fusion of image style transfer technology and pattern derivative design, and seek new avenues for the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology with China's intangible cultural heritage. The batch processing and high efficiency characteristics of AI technology are adopted and derivative design is taken as a medium to effectively disseminate black copper patterns infused with silver. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models from deep learning are employed and tuned with appropriate parameters. The deep learning framework realizes the generation of black copper patterns infused with silver. Furthermore, by incorporating image style transfer algorithms, novel pattern aesthetics are designed while preserving the distinctive features of black copper patterns infused with silver. Expert assessments through questionnaire responses reveal that the average rating for the visual aesthetics of the images is 4 points, with a high score of 4.08 for style simulation effectiveness, and a presentation rating of 3.67 for Yunnan's cultural connotation. Expert reviews show approval for the migration results in the experiment, as the transferred pattern designs satisfy aesthetic preferences and meet the standards for simulating different styles. This work provides valuable insights for the preservation and inheritance of black copper patterns infused with silver, as well as for promoting their diversified applications.},

  abstract={The use of Artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the content creation to produce creative aspects like editing, audience analysis, creating ideas, writing copy, etc. The major aim is to streamline and automate the process of content creation and convert it into a more efficient and effective way. There is a lack of transparency in the AI content production process and hence it does not exactly mimic human activities, which includes fantasizing and picking up new abilities. AI content creation requires more creativity while investigating with a specific goal in mind. Although, AI faces many challenges since it constantly expands its base knowledge. One of the biggest ethical problems is the probability that AI content is used to deceive or influence people. Hence, to overcome these difficulties a machine learning-based Artificial Intelligent content creation framework is generated for content creation in Ad-supported TV. Here, an effective model Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) introduced to deliver enterprise data, customize descriptions, and adjust content based on consumer behaviors. This developed model produces material that is closely related to the preferences of the user. AI content creation increases efficiency and productivity by saving time and money. It also leads to the development of better content. Finally, the experimental analysis is performed to find the effectiveness of the developed deep learning-based AI content creation framework via various metrics.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is a task in artificial intelligence where an intelligent agent is required to answer questions about its environment. For example, to answer a question such as "Is the TV on or off?", the agent must navigate to the room with the TV and answer with either "On." or "Off." after recognizing the status. Unlike traditional question-answering systems that rely solely on text or static images, EQA involves agents that can move through a physical or simulated space, interact with the environment, and gather information to respond accurately. The agent must interpret both visual and linguistic inputs, navigate the environment, and complete tasks or locate objects based on the user’s questions. However, in the real world, the agent always faces unseen environments (i.e. different people’s houses), which makes the pre-trained model fail. Meanwhile, re-training in an unseen environment can cause high costs. Therefore, it is significant for the agent to learn continually by itself to cope with the challenges of unseen environments. In this work, we proposed a continual learning method based on generative adversarial imitation learning and self-supervision to support the agent when facing unseen environments. Besides, we designed a policy generator and policy quality discriminator to generate action policy sequences and evaluate the quality of the policy, respectively. Extensive experiments on the MP3D-EQA dataset demonstrate that our method reaches state-of-the-art performance.},

  year={2024},
  volume={17},
  number={},
  pages={2025-2036},
  abstract={This article presents a controlled case study focused on implementing and using generative artificial intelligence, specifically large language models (LLMs), in physiotherapy education to assist instructors with formulating effective technology-mediated feedback for students. It outlines how these advanced technologies have been integrated into an existing feedback-oriented platform to guide instructors in providing feedback inputs and establish a reference framework for future innovations in practical skills training for health professions education. Specifically, the proposed solution uses LLMs to automatically evaluate feedback inputs made by instructors based on predefined and literature-based quality criteria and generates actionable textual explanations for reformulation. In addition, if the instructor requires, the tool supports summary generation for large sets of text inputs to achieve better student reception and understanding. The case study describes how these features were integrated into the feedback-oriented platform, how their effectiveness was evaluated in a controlled setting with documented feedback inputs, and the results of its implementation with real users through cognitive walkthroughs. Initial results indicate that this innovative implementation holds great potential to enhance learning and performance in physiotherapy education and has the potential to expand to other health disciplines where the development of procedural skills is critical, offering a valuable tool to assess and improve feedback based on quality standards for effective feedback processes. The cognitive walkthroughs allowed us to determine participants' usability decisions in the face of these new features and to evaluate the perceived usefulness, how this would integrate into their workload, and their opinion regarding the potential for the future within this teaching strategy. This article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for practice and future research directions in this developing field.},

  abstract={Contribution: This study offers an analysis of cybersecurity for continuing advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, we synthesized the literature and highlighted the possible cybersecurity risks and ethical concerns associated with advancements in AI. Background: Recent advancements in AI have implicated various risks and ethical concerns regarding cybersecurity. Prior literature studies have highlighted a plethora of these issues. We have conducted a systematic review to analyze the issues presented in the prior literature. Analyzing the issues presented has allowed us to answer one research question. Research Question: Our study answered one research question: Given the continuous advancements in artificial intelligence, what are cybersecurity's potential risks and ethical concerns? Methodology: We utilized the IEEE Xplore database to answer the research question. After setting the search criteria to journal articles posted between 2019 and 2024, we found 67 articles relevant to our keywords. After screening, we finalized 16 articles to address our research question. The articles selected were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. Articles were then categorized into three different themes: (1) social engineering, (2) misinformation and fake news, and (3) hacking. Findings: Our findings indicate that researchers have informed us about the malicious use of AI in cybersecurity by classifying attacks into three themes. These themes indicate the manner of attack. Furthermore, we find that the major risks and ethical concerns regarding the application of AI in cybersecurity relate to the preservation of privacy. As the field of artificial intelligence continues to grow, we see that it is imperative to continue monitoring the safety of this technology. For researchers to serve the public, future work should aim to translate technical terminology into more digestible phrases for those not knowledgeable in the field.},

  pages={1603-1607},
  abstract={With the rapid development of Generative AI technology, the detection and governance of fake news has become a hot topic of concern in academia and society. The wide dissemination of fake news not only disrupts the public's information perception but also triggers social phenomena such as information epidemics, posing significant challenges to social stability, political environment and public health. Especially driven by social media, the speed and breadth of information dissemination have greatly intensified the spread of fake news. The research findings indicate that Generative AI mainly focuses on the optimization of natural language processing and deep learning technologies, providing new technical support for the detection of fake news. Meanwhile, the role of social media platforms and information dissemination pathways have become the focus of scholars' attention. However, issues such as the dissemination of cross-platform fake news, the practical application of generative AI, and the accuracy and robustness of algorithms remain the main challenges in current research. In this regard, this article suggests that future research should further optimize large-scale language models, promote innovation in multimodal fake news detection technology, and strengthen research on cross platform fake news dissemination mechanisms, in order to provide more accurate and effective technical support for fake news governance and alleviate its negative impact on society.},

  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder caused by insulin resistance and dysfunctional glucose regulation that affects millions of individuals worldwide. However, managing T2D is challenging because blood glucose levels fluctuate due to diet, exercise, and patients’ idiosyncrasies. Approaches such as real-time monitoring, predictive modeling, and personalized treatment have been among the major breakthroughs in the field. Still, their holistic integration for dynamic dosing and dietary optimization has remained largely unexplored. This research analyzes insights from recent research that reveal different methodologies such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and predictive models in improving diabetes management outcomes. Some studies showed up to 1.5% HbA1c reduction and time-in-range improvement by 20% to 25% due to artificial intelligence (AI) driven interventions. The accuracy of blood glucose prediction in these studies ranged from 85% to 95%, thus showing that these models can control blood sugar levels at any given moment. The preliminary results show that dynamic dosing models combined with dietary recommendations may achieve a 0.8% to 1.2% decrease in HbA1c and a 10% to 15% improvement in overall glycemic control. This study investigates the applications of Digital Twin (DT) technology, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Generative AI (Gen AI) in diabetic control systems. The proposed model adopts these strategies to illustrate the possibility of connecting the existing research gaps and prepare for future developments on adaptive AI-powered framework for diabetes care.},

  abstract={This Innovative Practice Work-in-Progress paper presents a virtual, proactive, and collaborative learning paradigm that can engage learners with different backgrounds and enable effective retention and transfer of the multidisciplinary AI-cybersecurity knowledge. While progress has been made to better understand the trustworthiness and security of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, little has been done to translate this knowledge to education and training. There is a critical need to foster a qualified cybersecurity workforce that understands the usefulness, limitations, and best practices of AI technologies in the cybersecurity domain. To address this import issue, in our proposed learning paradigm, we leverage multidisciplinary expertise in cybersecurity, AI, and statistics to systematically investigate two cohesive research and education goals. First, we develop an immersive learning environment that motivates the students to explore AI/machine learning (ML) development in the context of real-world cybersecurity scenarios by constructing learning models with tangible objects. Second, we design a proactive education paradigm with the use of hackathon activities based on game-based learning, lifelong learning, and social constructivism. The proposed paradigm will benefit a wide range of learners, especially underrepresented students. It will also help the general public understand the security implications of AI. In this paper, we describe our proposed learning paradigm and present our current progress of this ongoing research work. In the current stage, we focus on the first research and education goal and have been leveraging cost-effective Minecraft platform to develop an immersive learning environment where the learners are able to investigate the insights of the emerging AI/ML concepts by constructing related learning modules via interacting with tangible AI/ML building blocks.},

  abstract={Ensemble classifiers are constructed from various component classifiers by aggregating the results of the individual classifiers in some manner. While there are many ways to do this, one of the least computationally intensive is to use a voting ensemble, where the vote of each classifier is weighted by a number representing its performance. Choosing the appropriate weights is an involved process, that ranges from using trial and error to using sophisticated machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we proposed a novel technique that uses generative adversarial networks to customize the weights used for each individual input to the ensemble. Specifically, we propose to use conditional generative adversarial networks to generate the weights, with the input image acting as the label to the network and the appropriate weight being the output. We test the proposed system on an image classification task and show that the proposed method produces better results than using fixed weights by 2.43 percent.},

In this approach, we employ the encoder as the feature extraction module, and then passes the features to the GANs for deblurring, followed by image reconstruction using the decoder as the last module. To ensure image fidelity, skip connections are introduced between the encoder and decoder. Meanwhile, we introduce a targeted training methodology designed to mitigate fluctuations in network parameters, thereby maximizing the efficacy of the model’s training velocity. We additionally conducted comparative evaluations based on the GoPro and Kohler datasets, contrasting our model against previously proposed algorithms to approve its exceptional performance in deblurring efficacy and efficiency.},

  abstract={A new algorithm framework is proposed, which combines the self-attention mechanism and the transformer model, to enhance the efficiency and quality of the creation of digital creative content. The system realizes the semantic understanding and generation tasks of multimodal data by designing a multi-layer Transformer architecture, and fully exploits the context modeling ability of the self-attention mechanism. To verify the performance of the algorithm, this paper simulates the model in image generation, text generation and multimodal content generation tasks. The test results show that the system has achieved significant improvements in the coherence, diversity and innovation of the generated content. Experiments on a public dataset show that the BLEU score of the generated text content is 12.3% higher than that of the traditional method, the FID index of image generation is reduced by 15.7%, and the semantic consistency score of multimodal generation reaches 92.4%. These results prove the superiority and practicality of the proposed algorithm.

  abstract={Recent advancements in Generative AI (GenAI) algorithms have been reshaping the software development lifecycle (SDLC) landscape. These transformations not only enhance the speed, accuracy, and productivity of SDLC tasks but also influence the roles and existence of software personas within the SDLC ecosystem. This study evaluates GenAI's effects on the roles of software personas engaged in the typical SDLC phases: planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. When evaluating these effects, it becomes evident that GenAI's impact varies across roles and their relation to specific SDLC phases and activities. While some roles experience a substantial impact, achieving full AI-driven automation remains a challenge for roles that demand critical thinking, empathy, and other human supervision. Overall, GenAI's penetration will necessitate new skills and a redefinition of roles for many tasks within SDLC, where humans and AI will collaborate to create better, faster, and more efficient software.},

The integration of neural networks, which excel at exploring complex data spaces, and symbolic KGs, which represent domain knowledge, allows AI systems to reason, learn, and generalize in a manner understandable to experts.

  abstract={With the development of artificial intelligence, the anomaly detection plays more and more important role in security monitoring field. Because it is difficult to label abnormal data, most of the supervised methods consumed a lot of manpower and obtained low performance and generality. Inspired by this motivation, this paper proposes a semi-supervised method for anomaly detection in video frames based on GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), in which only normal data was used as the training sample. The quality gap between the predicted frame and the ground truth is used as the basis to determine whether it is abnormal. Moreover, the mathematical morphology approach was adopted to locate the anomaly area in the frames. Experiments show that our method can successfully detect abnormal frames in video and can also locate the area where abnormal behavior occurs in frames.},

We begin by examining the necessity of integrating GenAI with 6G mobile services and exploring potential learning architectures of GenAI models within mobile networks. Next, we analyze potential solutions from two perspectives: how 6G mobile networks empower GenAI and how GenAI enables mobile services. We subsequently explore a promising use case, along with essential features and techniques, to facilitate the integration of GenAI and mobile services. Finally, we discuss future research directions, aiming at realizing intelligent 6G networks.},

In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on offline environments or CI/CD (Continuous integration and continuous deployment) pipelines, this methodology facilitates continuous performance enhancement during active usage of web application. An experimental evaluation involving 20 functions within a Laravel application demonstrated a 70% optimization success rate, a 62.6% reduction in execution time and an 18.18% decrease in code lines. This approach preserves semantic consistency and provides reports to developers for further implementation.

  abstract={Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact technology for measuring human physiological indicators. The rPPG signal is extracted through the periodic changes of the facial skin in the facial video. The rPPG signal extracted by most existing rPPG methods has low quality, and it only can be used for average heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR), etc. But for the field of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, higher quality rPPG signals are needed. This paper introduces a novel and efficient generative adversarial network method defined as rPPGGAN, which denoises and enhances the original rPPG signal extracted by a deep learning rPPG method to make it closer to the real rPPG signal. The HRV indicators were verified on the public datasets UBFC-rPPG and PURE, and both the time-domain indicators and frequency-domain indicators have been effectively improved. The method proposed in this paper is lightweight, efficient, and easy to integrate. It can effectively improve the rPPG signal quality after being integrated with other rPPG methods.},

  abstract={In recent years, with the rapid development of social media, a large number of open-source emotion recognition datasets have emerged online, providing abundant resources for emotion recognition. Meanwhile, with the help of deep learning, multimodal emotion recognition technology has advanced rapidly. However, deep learning-based multimodal emotion recognition still has some drawbacks, such as requiring a large amount of training data, inconsistencies in the quantity and quality of data within datasets, and heterogeneity among different modalities in multimodal fusion. To address these issues, we propose a multimodal emotion recognition framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which enhances feature representation and reduces heterogeneity in multimodal fusion. Finally, we achieve promising experimental results on the RAVDESS dataset.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the ethical-legal issues underlying the implementation of Large Language Models, in the aftermath of the European Union Parliament's approval of the Artificial Intelligence Regulation. In very recent years, there has been a rapid evolution and multiform implementation of the so-called Artificial Intelligence. Notably, one significant development in AI is the creation of systems capable of performing tasks based on a set of established rules. Artificial Intelligence has recently undergone a significant revolution that has led to a radical paradigm shift, represented by the so-called Foundation Models, which have two main characteristics: emergence and homogenisation. On the other hand, Language Modelling (LM) is one of the main approaches to advance the linguistic intelligence of machines and thus a Foundation Model trained on textual data. The most recent development of this approach can be found in the so-called Large Language Models (LLM). These take the form of artificial neural networks pre-trained on huge datasets which, instead of being dedicated to a specific task, can perform a wide range of different functions at a level that is all the more accurate the greater the resources made available to them. The concept of language models is not new but has evolved with the progress of artificial intelligence over the decades. In general, LLMs are mainly trained in industrial settings where many important details of training (e.g. data collection and cleaning) are not disclosed. Thus, it is difficult to align LLMs with human values or preferences. Despite their capabilities, LLMs are also likely to produce toxic, fictitious or harmful content. Therefore, effective and efficient control approaches are required to eliminate the potential risk arising from the use of LLMs. For the purposes of the study conducted, it is intended to describe the development and outcomes with the aim to show not only the evolution of the responses offered by various LLM, but also and above all the possible ethical and legal implications that can be deduced from these outputs. Several models have been used for the implementation of the experiments: two GPT-2 models, Perplexity, ChatGPT (version 3.5), Llama. The language used for the implementation of the experiments was English, as it is structurally more neutral. In particular, with reference to a topic with a strong ethical and legal impact such as suicide, different answers were offered by the various models used. In conclusion, the essay offers reflections on the results of the experiment with reference to the EU Regulation on Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence represents for the jurist, not only European, a decisive challenge not only with regard to the categories of thought and formulation of operational languages, but above all with regard to the centrality of the human being. On the basis of these considerations, focusing on generative AI and in particular on Large Language Models, it is clear that many of the issues relating to copyright and the protection of personal data still remain unsolved, excluding those already regulated by the legislation on the point.},

However, in complex social interaction scenarios, LLM agents may still lack a certain degree of social intelligence. This paper proposes the automatic generation of an external repository of social skills by powerful LLMs like GPT-4 to guide agents in social interactions. Based on the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, the proposed method utilizing relevance-based extraction and random sampling to choose appropriate strategies from the social skills repository to enhance the content generation of LLMs. The results demonstrate that this approach can effectively improves the social intelligence of agents across a variety of social interaction scenarios.},

  abstract={Mining anomalies and special events from massive network flows based on machine learning and deep learning is a promising approach for network management. However, it is difficult to build labeled network flow data sets for training machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) powered generative adversarial network (GAN) model named NF-GAN for network flow generation. The generator of NF-GAN is designed as a stochastic policy model to generate labeled network flow data. In terms of the discriminator, a check reward is integrated into the network reward to capture the correlations among attributes. Experiment results demonstrate that the majority of the generated flows conform to the strict network protocols of the standard OSI stack, and the success rate of network flows generation achieves 99.96%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time of applying RL powered GAN on network flow generation tasks.},

  abstract={Vehicle trajectory prediction, as one of the core technologies in intelligent transportation and autonomous driving, plays a significant role in reducing collision risks. However, complex spatiotemporal dependencies and dynamic interactions remain challenging technical issues that require urgent resolution. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a GAN-based multi-module fusion prediction model. By integrating multiple architectures-including a graph attention network, a Transformer encoder, and a temporal convolutional network-the model simultaneously optimizes spatial interactions, temporal dependencies, and trajectory feature modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with baseline methods such as CV, CS-LSTM, and TCN-LSTM, the proposed model significantly improves prediction accuracy by reducing the average displacement error and final displacement error by 24.38% and 14.46%, respectively, thereby fully validating its effectiveness in complex traffic scenarios.},

This chapter discusses how the readers can use AI and, specifically, generative AI to fuel the ideation processes. The results of specific ideation studies have shown AI&#x2010;generated ideas to be viable and on par with human&#x2010;generated ones. AI hallucinations can lead to unexpected, novel, and completely new ideas that break conventional thinking patterns. A common and useful scenario for using generative AI involves idea generation during a creative brainstorming process. A good starting point for combining human creativity with AI capabilities is to establish a prompt for both parties. The Creative Assistant tool augments human creativity, symbolizing the fusion of human ingenuity with AI capabilities.

  abstract={The rapid evolution of technology has transformed industries worldwide, revealing critical gaps in traditional educational approaches, particularly in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) including in the field of product development. Traditional academic frameworks often struggle to keep pace with industry demands, leaving some students underprepared for real-world challenges. This study identifies three core issues within STEM education: how to update curricula that lag technological advancements, limited opportunities for practical, hands-on application of skills, and constrained academic timeframes that limit the depth of transformative learning experiences.To address these issues, this research explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and Agile methodologies to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry practice in the field of product development. By examining two case studies - the development of an AI-driven media analysis tool for the United Nations International Computing Centre (UNICC) and AI-focused capstone projects within a Management and Systems graduate program. We show how applying Generative AI and Agile technologies can enhance curriculum relevance, expand real-world skill development opportunities, and optimize learning within semester-based time constraints. AI enables adaptive, personalized learning and automates routine tasks, while Agile’s iterative approach fosters engagement and adaptability in real-world problem-solving scenarios. AI is also a productive basis for product development in the integrative experience of a capstone. This research shows how combining AI and Agile provides an integrated framework for modernizing educational practices, equipping students with essential industry-relevant skills for a technology-driven workforce.},

  abstract={With the advancement of big data, the scope and potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have acquired major momentum. Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) is one of the most emergent fields of study in the current era of digitalization. Many examples have proven the effectiveness of Machine- and Deep Learning methods. In industrial production, however, limitations are still present that hinder application online and in a series that goes beyond isolated use cases. One crucial issue is data precondition, i.e., data quality, consistency, and labeling. As DCAI addresses these issues, developments in this field have caught the attention of various experts. In summary, DCAI continues to be an exciting and promising field of study that enhances AI applicability. Several research works have been conducted in DCAI, but unfortunately, no comprehensive reviews have been conducted to summarize and highlight the results. This gap in knowledge inspired our work, that aims to answer well-structured research questions. The focus of this paper is to clarify the terminology used in DCAI while also distinguishing it from other AI-related problems. This helps to analyze the current standards and problems associated with DCAI. This paper summarizes current use cases of DCAI and their impact on industries. Through this detailed description, readers can understand the potential and benefits of using DCAI in different business sectors. The analysis of the latest methods employed by DCAI to achieve enhanced AI performance and outcomes provides valuable insights for professionals and organizations that strive to incorporate AI into their business.},

  abstract={The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has increased drastically in recent years, offering transformative potential in creativity, productivity, and decision-making across various domains. However, concerns are growing among practitioners and academics about its tendency to produce inaccurate or nonsensical outputs—a phenomenon known as generative AI hallucinations. While scholars have begun exploring this phenomenon, most of the existing research focuses on technical issues and solutions. This research takes a behavioral approach to examine the association between individual personality traits and tolerance of generative AI hallucinations. Drawing on error management theory and the big five personality traits, we examine how individuals with different personality traits tolerate generative AI hallucinations. The study contributes to calls from management journals to investigate the challenges associated with generative AI use. Our findings provide important theoretical implications and offer actionable insights for engineering managers seeking to implement generative AI.},

  abstract={Recent advancements in AI, especially generative AI (gAI), are accelerating industrial digitalisation, with the market projected to grow significantly by 2030. However, challenges such as the black-box nature of AI decisions, biased data, and AI-generated hallucinations continue to hinder industrial trust. AI also requires better adaptability to dynamic environments and stronger accountability mechanisms. To address these challenges, this paper proposed an adaptive gAI-based multi-agent framework that enables collaboration between human actors and multiple AI agents, i.e. ExplainAgent, AuditAgent, RobustAgent and AutoAgent tailored to mirror and provide specialised support for the various aspects of trustworthy AI. Each of the agents will be clearly defined and specialised through the customisation of multiple modules encompassing 1) Communication and Cooperation, 2) Ensure Trust and 3) Execute and Evaluate Decisions. The framework focuses on improving explainability, fairness, and robustness while fostering human-AI collaboration with the aim of advancing trustworthy AI methods, tools and best practices leveraging AI and related technologies.},

  abstract={A camouflage pattern is a texture pattern that contains various colors and localized shapes to be blended with landscapes or objects. Although most of camouflage patterns are generally created by randomly combining colors and various local shapes based on human subjectivity, it can be difficult to generate an appropriate camouflage pattern according to a specific background image. In this paper, we propose a method that can emergently generate complex camouflage patterns by using an Ant Painting algorithm. In the proposed method, after some features of an input image are extracted, artificial ants draws a camouflage according to the features. We demonstrate that, by interaction among ants, the proposed method can generate camouflage patterns which are more complex but blends better with the background image than random generation.},

  abstract={This paper explores the integration of ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model, in the domain of cultural heritage Artificial Intelligence-based e-learning, with a specific focus on the analysis and interpretation of lyrics and poems. Cultural heritage preservation and education have increasingly turned to Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance learning experiences and promote the understanding and appreciation of diverse artistic expressions. We have conducted an initial empirical study on how ChatGPT can assist learners in analysing and interpreting poetic and lyrics works, offering insights into the historical, cultural, and literary significance embedded within the verses. Our findings highlight ChatGPT's significant potential but also major weaknesses with respect to poetry and lyrics. ChatGPT was found particularly good in the field of interpreting poetic content. Additionally, ChatGPT showed a very good performance in analogy identification, demonstrating a broad knowledge base encompassing various form of poetry, from Ancient Greek works to ecclesiastic hymns and modern compositions. However, opportunities for enhancement are evident in translation and historical context provision. Finally, ChatGPT's weakest aspect was its factual accuracy, occasionally producing errors without indicating uncertainty in its responses. Consequently, while ChatGPT displays substantial promise, its application in e-learning settings is not mature due to observed inaccuracies. Furthermore, we introduced MUSILYAN, a specialised software tool designed for musicological and lyrical analysis, complementing ChatGPT's capabilities. While Chat-GPT excels in natural language understanding and generation, MUSILYAN offers structured semantic content management and thematic organisation of lyrics. The integration of ChatGPT and MUSILYAN holds promise for enhancing the exploration and understanding of poetry and lyrics.},

  abstract={As a specific category of artificial intelligence (AI), generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) generates new content that resembles what humans create. The rapid development of GenAI systems has created a huge amount of new data on the Internet, posing new challenges to current computing and communication frameworks. Currently, GenAI services rely on the traditional cloud computing framework due to the need for large computation resources. However, such services will encounter high latency because of data transmission and a high volume of user requests. On the other hand, edge-cloud computing can provide adequate computation power and low latency at the same time through the collaboration between edges and the cloud. Thus, it is attractive to build GenAI systems at scale by leveraging the edge-cloud computing paradigm. In this overview paper, we review recent developments in GenAI and edge-cloud computing, respectively. Then, we use two exemplary GenAI applications to discuss technical challenges in scaling up their solutions using edge-cloud collaborative systems. Finally, we list design considerations for training and deploying GenAI systems at scale and point out future research directions.},

  pages={35-44},
  abstract={Aiming at achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the metaverse, pretrained foundation models (PFMs), e.g., generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), can effectively provide various artificial intelligence (AI) services, such as autonomous driving, digital twins (DTs), and AI-generated content (AIGC) for extended reality (XR). With the advantages of low latency and privacy-preserving, serving PFMs of mobile AI services in edge intelligence is a viable solution for caching and executing PFMs on edge servers with limited computing resources and GPU memory. However, PFMs typically consist of billions of parameters that are computation- and memory-intensive for edge servers during loading and execution. In this article, we investigate edge PFM serving problems for mobile AIGC services of the metaverse. First, we introduce the fundamentals of PFMs and discuss their characteristic fine-tuning and inference methods in edge intelligence. Then, we propose a novel framework of joint model caching and inference for managing models and allocating resources to satisfy users’ requests efficiently. Furthermore, considering the in-context learning ability of PFMs, we propose a new metric to evaluate the freshness and relevance between examples in demonstrations and executing tasks, namely the Age of Context (AoC). Finally, we propose a least-context (LC) algorithm for managing cached models at edge servers by balancing the tradeoff among latency, energy consumption, and accuracy.},

Due to the success of classical generative adversarial networks, the quantum researcher created quantum version of GAN and also called as quantum generative adversarial network (QGANs) which works on quantum computers which use quantum mechanics techniques such as quantum entanglement, superposition, teleportation and many more. The successful implementation in real life of quantum computers are not easy because of limited quantum resources and access to quantum processors but instead of that there are different QGAN models for different purpose, such as drug discovery, finance, image generation and many more which shown good result as compare to their classical counterparts. This study is reviewed based on authors that proposed different QGAN models along with the techniques proposed on those papers for generating images, which datasets was considered, which parameters are considered, what their limitations and how to future research directions to overcome those problems.},

  abstract={This paper explores and envisions a collaboration between Facial Expression Recognition (FER) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to create an advanced human-computer interaction (HCI) experience. Deep learning techniques are harnessed to interpret human emotions from facial expressions, using a structured approach that includes pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. The data acquired from the FER stage informs GenAI systems—such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs)—to produce contextually relevant and emotionally resonant responses. The proposed system leverages a sophisticated camera setup to capture facial data with high accuracy under diverse lighting conditions, ensuring robust and reliable emotion inference. Virtual avatars complete the multimodal experience by generating corresponding nonverbal cues. Special attention is given to creating a dynamic feedback loop for continuous learning and adaptation, leading to increasingly effective human-computer dialogues. Ethical implications, such as user privacy, data security, and bias mitigation, are central to the design and deployment of this system, underscoring the commitment to ethical standards and user empowerment.

  abstract={Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have emerged as potent tools for generating high-quality, creative content across various media, including audio, images, videos, and 3-D models. Their application in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) marks a pivotal advancement in the evolution from the Internet of Things (IoT) to the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Considering the inherent multiple-access nature of AIoT, training GDMs via federated learning and deploying them collaboratively is paramount. However, such approaches introduce considerable security risks and energy consumption challenges. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive architecture for GDMs, encompassing both training and sampling stages. This architecture, termed secure and sustainable diffusion (SS-Diff), aims to thwart trigger-based security threats, such as backdoor attacks and trojan attacks, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption in multiple-access AIoT. The SS-Diff architecture incorporates a dynamic quantization mechanism within the training phase, significantly reducing communication overhead and thereby improving both spectrum and energy efficiency. During the sampling stage, a detection-based defense strategy is employed to identify and negate trigger inputs associated with malicious attacks. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of the SS-Diff architecture. The results demonstrate that the SS-Diff can effectively train GDMs and eliminate the impact of the attacks, compared with existing schemes.},

  abstract={In the Internet of Things era, the Internet demands extremely high-speed communication and data transformation. To this end, the tactile Internet has been proposed as a medium that provides the sense of touch ability, facilitating data transferability with extra-low latency in various applications ranging from industry, robotics, and healthcare to road traffic, education, and culture. Here, programmable networks are role players in approaching the tactile Internet’s low latency (≈ 1ms) pillar. Several functionalities – including security – are offloaded onto the network core employing programmable in-network pipelines. From the security perspective, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is another role player that enables the line-rate inference on the core network without involving the control plane. However, integrating AI-based security solutions in programmable devices is challenging mainly because of their constrained anatomy. Furthermore, such solutions inherit well-known adversarial AI vulnerabilities, representing an additional threat to programmable networks. Considering the above, this article discusses AI-based security solutions in programmable networks, focusing on the explored modalities of integrating AI models in programmable constrained network devices. Moreover, we elaborate on the challenges and risks of relying on AI for such mechanisms. Lastly, the article brings a visionary glimpse for future trends in this regard, raising some essential questions on the indispensability of AI for security functionalities and providing some alternative solutions.},

  abstract={A chatbot is equally vital if its purpose and objective are known. Chatbots are commonly used in marketing, sales, and customer service. Artificial Intelligence has been with us since the first half of the twentieth century. Due to hardware limitations at that time, computers could not execute and store commands. Because of the fast pace of technology, both storing and executing flourished, and so came the birth of artificial intelligence. This study aims to explore how artificial intelligence affects customer relations by discussing different kinds of chatbots. It briefly outlines how integrating chatbots or conversational AI significantly affects how customers behave in the retail business. Incorporating human characteristics into conversational agents drives the design of generative AI chatbots. Studies indicate that more work has to be done to improve chatbot performance. Improvements include reducing the chatbot's usage of cliches and enabling users to approach conversations sincerely. Studies indicate that more work has to be done to improve chatbot performance. Circling back to the anthropomorphism theory, trust in chatbots and chatbot overload further significantly impact service evaluation and customer purchase.},

  abstract={Nowadays, IoT devices have a remarkable place in daily life activities. Because of their wide application scope, cyber-attacks have started to increase as causing a critical issue in terms of data security. Because of this, some analyses within IoT network environments should be done for prevention and detection purposes. At this point, it is also important to train users to establish an awareness about cyber threats for IoT and how to analyze network environments in case of unexpected situations. This paper introduces a Web platform, which provides some IoT security scenarios to learn about how to understand / detect cyber threats and test their knowledge. In detail, the platform uses a synthetic dataset of network data pointing malicious or benign network activities. The dataset was generated by Generative Adversarial Networks, which was fed by some original network traffic datasets. Thanks to the synthetic dataset, the platform is able to provide tests or scenarios for randomly chosen network traffic data so that users can learn and test their skills in terms of IoT security. The applications revealed that GAN was successful enough to generate synthetic traffic datasets and the users were positive about their experiences with the developed Web platform.},

  abstract={The integration of more sensory and actuation components to the Smart Grid produces high volume of data. Consequently, this big data stretches the transmission, processing, and storage capabilities of the Smart Grid infrastructures. The vulnerability of advanced metering infrastructures (AMIs) is on the rise, as more devices are connected to the Internet these days. The aforementioned realities have continued to necessitate a debate on the future of cloud-centered artificial intelligence (AI) services for latency-sensitive user-centric IoT applications. It is rapidly becoming necessary to leverage on the applicability of EdgeAI directly on IoT sensory nodes involved in energy metering. This paper proposes the applicability of Artificial Intelligence situated on smart meter, to perform micro analytics at the edge of AMI networks: Artificial Intelligence of Things. Therefore, a functional AMI model based on IoT and EdgeAI is presented herein. Additionally, an integration architecture for the anticipated Smart Grid based on IoT and EdgeAI is presented. On implementation, the proposed model would provide high performance analytics and Edge computing capabilities to enable AMIs initiate instant data check at the source and relay relevant real-time data to the Utility through the Internet.},

  abstract={Computational thinking has been globally recognized as a necessary skill in the "Artificial Intelligence Era". With the popularization of programming and computational thinking education, how to effectively assess students' computational thinking skills in the context of AI has attracted the attention of researchers. Therefore, this study used a collaborative approach between teachers and AIGC to develop test questions to assess Chinese elementary and middle school students' computational thinking by combining artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, and computational thinking skills. The analysis of 125 students in China showed that the computational thinking test developed in this study has good validity and reliability. It was also found that the higher the student's grade level, the higher their computational thinking skills. The study's findings can provide practical references for frontline primary and secondary school IT teachers to conduct computational thinking education.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={326-331},
  abstract={This study addresses the limitations of traditional prescribed meal plans, which lack personalization and often prove monotonous and challenging for patients to follow. We propose a novel approach employing generative artificial intelligence in the context of a learning health system, with an emphasis on inpatient clinical dietetics. The system incorporates two key models: the Meal Plan Generation Model, MeaIGM, and the Meal Plan Image Generation Model, MealImageGM, leveraging state-of-the-art large language models. Patient information from electronic health records and clinical dietetics guidelines are incorporated into prompts for MeaIGM, which is refined through nutritionist validations and users' feedback. On the other hand, MealImageGM generates visual representations of meal plans to enhance patient engagement, utilizing crowd-sourced feedback to optimize image generation prompts. The overall system process includes extracting data from electronic health records, pre-designed user meal generation prompts, and the generation of personalized meal plans and images. Nutritionists play a crucial role in monitoring patient adherence and preferences, contributing to a continuous learning health system cycle. The proposed framework ensures clinically appropriate and personalized meal plans, aligning with dynamic dietary recommendations. The study emphasizes the importance of patient-physician co-creation for constant optimization and highlights the potential positive impact on health outcomes.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models and generative AI, is emerging as a significant force in software development, offering developers powerful tools that span the entire development lifecycle. Although software engineering research has extensively studied AI tools in software development, the specific types of interactions between developers and these AI-powered tools have only recently begun to receive attention. Understanding and improving these interactions has the potential to enhance productivity, trust, and efficiency in AI-driven workflows. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy of interaction types between developers and AI tools, identifying eleven distinct interaction types, such as auto-complete code suggestions, command-driven actions, and conversational assistance. Building on this taxonomy, we outline a research agenda focused on optimizing AI interactions, improving developer control, and addressing trust and usability challenges in AI-assisted development. By establishing a structured foundation for studying developer-AI interactions, this paper aims to stimulate research on creating more effective, adaptive AI tools for software development.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has the potential to improve learning outcomes, which has aroused great interest in the field of education. However, few studies have explored the relationship between learning motivation, GAI technology acceptance, and learning outcomes. A total of 313 pre-service teachers were recruited at N Normal University in China. Questionnaire methods were used for data collection. The results of the structural equation show that: (1) GAI technology acceptance significantly predicted the learning outcomes, while the GAI use behavior did not. (2) Intrinsic motivation significantly predicted the GAI technology acceptance, while extrinsic motivation did not. (3) GAI technology acceptance plays a mediating role between the relationship of intrinsic motivation and learning outcomes. Based on the results of this study, some suggestions were put forward to improve the learning outcomes of pre-service teachers using GAI technology.},
