  abstract={With the rapid development of deep learning technology, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved significant results in the field of image generation. However, traditional GAN models are often seen as “black boxes,” with their internal decision-making processes lacking transparency. This limits their trustworthiness and controllability in practical applications. This study addresses the needs for generating and transferring exhibition hall design styles by proposing a deep learning model that combines Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technology and a user preference adaptation system. By introducing an attention mechanism to design interpretability modules, the transparency of the generation process is enhanced. A personalized user input interface is developed, enabling controllability and flexibility in style generation. Moreover, a multimodal information fusion method is employed to improve the accuracy of text-to-image generation. The experimental results show that the improved model not only enhances user trust and satisfaction with the generated results but also demonstrates high accuracy and diversity in the tasks of generating and transferring exhibition hall design styles.},

  abstract={With the advancement of medical technology, it is now crucial to diagnose illnesses using medical imaging. From one end of the network to the other, medical pictures frequently travel across its branches. High-level security is therefore necessary. Unauthorised usage of the image's data causes issues. One of the most efficient approaches in this area is encryption, which is one of the strategies used to protect the data in the picture. Here, we focus on two key steps: confusion and dispersion. The deep neural network is modified by the amount of weight that has the most impact on the output, whether it be an intermediate result or an elimination output, in addition to an unorganised structure that is undetected utilising deep neural network techniques. The proposed method used colour and greyscale images by segmenting them according to the Region of Interest of the deep neural network algorithm. In order to randomly construct an unpredictable structure that involved the addition or deletion of columns and as well as the rows, the method was then utilised to randomly distribute the pixels inside the designated region and generate random integers. To demonstrate the value of the suggested approach, the suggested algorithm is assessed in a number of ways and contrasted with the current approaches. The model number of changing pixel rate (NPCR) provides a 99.62 value.},

  pages={877-881},
  abstract={As an essential resource in High Mountain Regions (HMR), evaluating the glacial lake dynamics is of great significance to explore the impacts of climate changes and predict the risks of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs). However, complicated and laborious methods for glacial lake mapping are unpractically applied in automatically monitoring glacial lakes at a large-scale region. In this work, we explored the mapping efficiency of glacial lakes by combing Generative Adversarial Networks and multi-level feature pyramid (GANMFP) in HMR. We first sampled the image patches containing glacial lakes from Landsat-8 raw data to evaluate the model performance. Totally, 6583 patches with 256x256x7 pixels are randomly cropped from 62 Landsat-8 images. Then we employed these data to train and test the GAN model, which integrated a multi-level feature fusion module in generator and a Resnet-152 networks in discriminator. From the validation results and result visualization, our method achieved good performances in Precision (88.42), Recall (59.61), and Overall Accuracy (99.28), which shows excellent potential in glacial lake mapping at a large-scale region.},

  abstract={Brain stroke is causing severe damage to health besides causingdeaths across the globe. Healthcare industry has got technological innovations to improve quality of service. With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) medical image analysis has unprecedented possibilities. Deep learning approaches have gained popularity for analysing medical images for automatic diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning models such as VGG16, ResNet50 and DenseNet121 are found to be suitable for image processing. However, as one size does not fit all, there is need for optimizing these models in order to adapt them for brain stroke detection and leverage their performance. Towards this end, in this paper, we proposed an AI enabled framework with optimizations to the aforementioned deep models.

  abstract={While current research predominantly focuses on image-based colorization, the domain of video-based colorization remains relatively unexplored. Many existing video colorization techniques operate frame-by-frame, often overlooking the critical aspect of temporal coherence between successive frames. This approach can result in inconsistencies across frames, leading to undesirable effects like flickering or abrupt color transitions between frames. To address these challenges, we combine the generative capabilities of a fine-tuned latent diffusion model with an autoregressive conditioning mechanism to ensure temporal consistency in automatic speaker video colorization. We demonstrate strong improvements on established quality metrics compared to existing methods, namely, PSNR, SSIM, FID, FVD, NIQE and BRISQUE. Specifically, we achieve an 18% improvement in performance when FVD is employed as the evaluation metric. Furthermore, we performed a subjective study, where users preferred LatentColorization to the existing state-of-the-art DeOldify 80% of the time. Our dataset combines conventional datasets and videos from television/movies. A short demonstration of our results can be seen in some example videos available at https://youtu.be/vDbzsZdFuxM.},

  abstract={Generative AI offers innovative opportunities for the digital development of LEGO education and poses the dual challenges of technological ethics and the nature of education. This study explores the core application scenarios of generative AI in the development of LEGO digital learning resources, which significantly improves the efficiency and creative boundaries of educational resource development. Generative AI significantly improves the development efficiency and creative boundaries of digital learning resources by rapidly generating LEGO model prototypes and assisting interdisciplinary curriculum design. At the same time, it dynamically adjusts task difficulty and provides real-time feedback by analyzing student behavioral data, enabling truly personalized learning support. These applications lower the threshold of innovation, expand educational possibilities, and promote the construction of a sustainable education ecosystem by optimizing the reuse of resources. However, this convergence also poses key techno-ethical risks, including data bias, privacy concerns arising from excessive data collection from children, and homogenization of creativity due to AI “best solution” algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a two-track evaluation mechanism for “ethical education” that defines the boundaries of human-computer collaboration, and emphasizes the need for shared social responsibility to ensure positive empowerment in the generation of AI. Future research directions include deepening multi-sensory learning experiences that combine reality with reality, and further exploring synergistic development paths between technology and human-centered education.},

  abstract={This study aims to explore the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in art education, assessing its impact on learners’ experiences and learning outcomes. The study first proposes a digital teaching system that enables the IoT and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to play a role in art education by monitoring students’ creative state in real-time, providing immediate feedback, and facilitating the generation of creative works. The system framework includes sensor nodes, an IoT platform, a GAN model, and a user interface to build a real-time interactive environment. Sensor nodes constantly collect physiological, movement, and environmental data from students, and the GAN model receives student data from the IoT platform, combining creative input from students to generate artwork in real-time. The generated works are transmitted to the discriminator through the IoT platform, which evaluates their quality and provides real-time feedback. Students interact with the system through the user interface, observe the generated artwork, adjust generator parameters, and propose new ideas. These interactions influence further artistic creation. The WikiArt public art creation dataset is selected to establish the experimental foundation, and the experimental evaluation focuses on image generation quality, system performance, and student learning outcomes. It is compared with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models. The research results indicate that the designed IoT and GANs integrated system remarkably outperforms DCGAN and VAE in image generation quality, with an Inception Score of 4.5, which is more diverse and recognizable than other models. Regarding system performance, the IoT and GANs integrated system is significantly ahead in image generation speed and user interaction, with a transmission speed of up to 200 Mbps. Regarding student learning outcomes, the system performs excellently in emotional feedback, learning outcomes, and creative work quality, achieving 80% satisfaction and 90% positive feedback. Overall, the research conclusion clearly points out that the integration of IoT and GANs has a significant and comprehensive effect on improving the quality of art education. This study expands the field of art education by integrating IoT and GANs, enhancing students’ creative experiences, and providing innovative methods for art teaching in the digital age.},

Therefore, we explore how generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) can revolutionize safety management in CSCs by providing proactive monitoring, predictive analysis, and enhanced training. Nevertheless, integrating this technology requires addressing technical, data security, operational, trust, and ethical issues. Future research and practices should focus on overcoming these barriers to harness Gen AI's potential for enhancing safety in CSCs.},

  abstract={In recent years, the deep learning, and artificial intelligence, have advanced rapidly and make significant breakthroughs with the help of generative architectures. In general, these are broadly broken down into either Text to image (T2I) architectures or Large Language Models (LLMs). Generating AI has been broadly explored in most domains, but the detection of long tailed is undeveloped. The scarcity of data for tail classes becomes the key challenge among its shortage in long-tailed image classification, and thus poor generalization tends to occur. To address this issue, traditional methods make use of constructive learning, mix based augmentation, re weighting, and resampling. But still, all these techniques do not generalize well to the representations of tail classes for data imbalance. In order to tackle the limitations of it, this research develops a hybrid generative learning model with synthetic data augmentation, contrastive learning, and adaptive label correction for improving long tailed image detection. The architecture takes advantage of T2I models to create synthetic data that is then refined via mix-based augmentation (MixUP and CutMix) and processed through Contrastive learning base encoder. The meaningful representations are extracted using a ResNet backbone and the model generalization is improved using supervised contrastive learning (SCL). Moreover, there is a label correction module which dynamically identifies low quality synthetic labels using KNN method, providing data integrity. The proposed method is also demonstrated to significantly improve the classification accuracy for the tail classes, and to outperform conventional techniques. Generative AI is shown to promise to fill the gap between synthetically and real-life data and make robust long tailed image classification possible with an adaptive and correcting nature.},

Students and educators alike will have to adapt to the newly available technology and find ways to use it in a meaningful and profitable way. Summarized, this means that both parties need to develop media competence in using generative AI on their end in academic education. New ways of learning and teaching are required, as well as a change in how educators grade the students’ learning status. While the latter should be made aware of the opportunities that generative AI provides them with, educators should actively make use of it in their courses in order to enhance their teaching.},

  abstract={Engineering education is constantly evolving to keep up with the latest technological developments and meet the changing needs of the engineering industry. One promising development in this field is the use of generative artificial intelligence technology, such as the ChatGPT conversational agent. ChatGPT has the potential to offer personalized and effective learning experiences by providing students with customized feedback and explanations, as well as creating realistic virtual simulations for hands-on learning. However, it is important to also consider the limitations of this technology. ChatGPT and other generative AI systems are only as good as their training data and may perpetuate biases or even generate and spread misinformation. Additionally, the use of generative AI in education raises ethical concerns such as the potential for unethical or dishonest use by students and the potential unemployment of humans who are made redundant by technology. While the current state of generative AI technology represented by ChatGPT is impressive but flawed, it is only a preview of what is to come. It is important for engineering educators to understand the implications of this technology and study how to adapt the engineering education ecosystem to ensure that the next generation of engineers can take advantage of the benefits offered by generative AI while minimizing any negative consequences.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a critical role in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) as urban areas grow by processing data for safety enhancements, predictive analysis, and traffic management. This results in better traffic control, lower emissions, and preventative actions to lessen the effects of accidents. Despite these developments, there isn’t a thorough academic analysis that covers a variety of optimization strategies for transportation AI models. By presenting an in-depth analysis of AI optimization methods and their uses in ITSs, this work seeks to close this knowledge gap and give academics important new information on possible directions for future research. Model-based optimization approaches, reinforcement learning techniques, model-predictive control techniques, and generative AI techniques are the four areas into which this study divides AI optimization techniques for the sake of structure, clarity, and comparative analysis. Subcategories of optimization techniques and their corresponding applications are explored, and each category is thoroughly addressed. Researchers will be better able to comprehend the state of AI optimization for transportation management today and in the future thanks to this methodical methodology. The most cutting-edge optimization methods created in the last five years are summarized in this review. This work acts as a compass for future research initiatives targeted at developing scalable and adaptable AI solutions for transportation management by identifying common approaches and highlighting research needs.},

  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={AI facial recognition for real-time emotion detection in online learning environments intends to analyze students’ sentiments throughout online classes, recognizing emotions such as focused, neutral, distracted, enraged, thrilled, or dissatisfied states. The proposed approach uses a generative model trained by conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) to accomplish De-expression Residue Learning (DeRL), a facial expression recognition technique. DeRL prioritizes gathering residue for delicate emotion recognition by filtering expressive material and storing it in intermediary layers. This technology gives educators and researchers real-time insights into students’ emotional states, allowing for a more thorough understanding of collective student involvement through the lens of socially shared control of learning. Experiments on seven facial expression databases, including two pre-training datasets, indicate that DeRL outperforms other methods in accurately recognizing and classifying students’ emotions. The findings emphasize its ability to capture subtle feelings during online learning. The discussion dives into theoretical and practical implications, highlighting AI’s potential to enhance the evaluation of student participation in online learning environments. The study concludes by providing relevant information for building tailored learning experiences, indicating a possible avenue for incorporating AI in the classroom.},

  abstract={Concerns regarding energy use, environmental effects, and long-term sustainability have been highlighted in recent years by the expanding application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare. This systematic review paper categorizes and classifies AI algorithms and tools in the healthcare sector to support more sustainable practices, focusing on reducing energy use while maintaining high standards in diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. AI algorithms and tools are categorized into three groups: explicit AI algorithms for sustainability for energy efficiency (e.g., Federated Learning, Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimization, Modified Lempel-Ziv-Welch (mLZW)), traditional AI algorithms for sustainable healthcare (e.g., Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)), and sustainable AI techniques (e.g., Adaptive Sampling, AutoML for Model Compression (AMC)) that support low-power computing (e.g., edge computing, neuromorphic hardware, adaptive sampling). A comprehensive performance analysis is presented across five dimensions: energy consumption, latency, accuracy, complexity, and cost. The review highlights mLZW as promising for energy efficiency, complexity, and cost, OFA for low-latency deployment, and Hybrid Quantum Classical Optimization for diagnostic accuracy. We propose an integration framework for deploying these methods in resource-constrained healthcare environments, identifying open research challenges and future directions. This work provides a foundational guide for researchers and sector practitioners to build energy-aware, high-performance AI systems in healthcare.},

Solving these problems is of great significance for developing image creation methods in intelligent and automated way and improving image reproduction efficiency. The core innovation of this research lies in data analogy association and analysis of image creation by automated pastiche. The image is taken as a system, which analyzes audience data and makes creative decision as agent. Image pastiche is achieved in the system by judging audience aesthetics from big data analysis. From automatic recognition to automatic generation, data intelligent simulation can develop traditional image production techniques or processes, and efficiently reproduce images by pastiche. More efficient image productivity will increase innovative meaning and intelligent labor value of automated pastiche.

  abstract={To solve the problem that images reconstructed by traditional super-resolution reconstruction (SR) techniques are smooth and lack good details, in this paper, we have presented an improved generative adversarial network for image super-resolution. The improved method was based on deep neural networks whose generative model contained a multi-layer convolution module and multi-layer deconvolution module, in which a layer hopping connection and a loss function was added to the perceptual loss. The discriminant model was made up of a multi-layer neural network whose loss function was based on the discriminant model loss function that was generated from the generative adversarial network. Finally, we selected PSNR and SSIM as the indicator in the experiments. In the experiments, the PSNR value of 2x, 3x and 4x magnification factor are improved on average by 1.125, 2.175 and 2.075 respectively and the SSIM value of 2x, 3x and 4x magnification factor are basically improved. Compared with the existing image super-resolution reconstruction methods, the effectiveness of the method that we proposed in image super-resolution reconstruction was proven.},

  abstract={COVID-19 outbreak has put the whole world in an unprecedented difficult situation bringing life around the world to a frightening halt and claiming thousands of lives. Due to COVID-19's spread in 212 countries and territories and increasing numbers of infected cases and death tolls mounting to 5,212,172 and 334,915 (as of May 22 2020), it remains a real threat to the public health system. This paper renders a response to combat the virus through Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some Deep Learning (DL) methods have been illustrated to reach this goal, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Long/Short Term Memory (LSTM). It delineates an integrated bioinformatics approach in which different aspects of information from a continuum of structured and unstructured data sources are put together to form the user-friendly platforms for physicians and researchers. The main advantage of these AI-based platforms is to accelerate the process of diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 disease. The most recent related publications and medical reports were investigated with the purpose of choosing inputs and targets of the network that could facilitate reaching a reliable Artificial Neural Network-based tool for challenges associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, there are some specific inputs for each platform, including various forms of the data, such as clinical data and medical imaging which can improve the performance of the introduced approaches toward the best responses in practical applications.},

  year={2021},
  volume={41},
  number={1},
  pages={8-14},
  abstract={Public awareness and concern about climate change often do not match the magnitude of its threat to humans and our environment. One reason for this disagreement is that it is difficult to mentally simulate the effects of a process as complex as climate change and to have a concrete representation of the impact that our individual actions will have on our own future, especially if the consequences are long term and abstract. To overcome these challenges, we propose to use cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to develop an interactive personalized visualization tool, the AI climate impact visualizer. It will allow a user to enter an address—be it their house, their school, or their workplace—-and it will provide them with an AI-imagined possible visualization of the future of this location in 2050 following the detrimental effects of climate change such as floods, storms, and wildfires. This image will be accompanied by accessible information regarding the science behind climate change, i.e., why extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and what kinds of changes are happening on a local and global scale.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Sustainability, to describe it in simpler words, is a process of making things less bad. It is not a long-term solution even if it limits the destruction of the environment to a manageable level. Nevertheless, by just becoming sustainable, one cannot bring back what has been lost. The restoration approach is immediately required to fixing what has been broken by using renewable energy, reforestation and creating biodiversity gains. Redesigning our industrial system of production and consumption around the circular patterns of resource and energy use that we observe in mature ecosystems is a must and a complex endeavour. To create a truly regenerative economy challenges us to work with huge amounts of data. New techniques of data science and artificial intelligence are required in each step of the ecological design. This paper presents some examples of biomimicry in circular design and proposes techniques that integrate data science and artificial intelligence (AI) as tools to accelerate the transition towards the regenerative approach. AI, as an emergent `Fourth Industrial Revolution' technology, can support and accelerate the pace of human innovation to design the future urban developments, to enable innovation in cities. AI has the capability to create a step change, to support an effective economic system that is regenerative by design.},

  abstract={Since the early 2000s, the digital transformation of the National Museum of Korea has led to the creation of numerous digital data related to artifacts. When the initial digital cultural heritage data began to be accumulated, the focus was on ‘recording’ rather than ‘public disclosure’, so the data disclosed to the public was extremely small. In addition, unlike systematically managed cultural heritage, ‘replicated data’ in digital form is relatively unstructured in terms of creation, management, and storage. To systematize the many digital data that are piled up in a disorderly manner, a lot of manpower and cost must be invested, but there are limits to solving this with limited resources. This study proposes a standard for classifying cultural heritage data by introducing artificial intelligence technology to solve these problems, and further suggests ways to use digital data more creatively using artificial intelligence technology.},

  abstract={The main goal of this paper is to propose a framework to better understand and capitalize on the many implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for education, especially but not limited to the most recent developments of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Four complementary categories are identified, each presenting diverse opportunities and challenges:1)Leveraging AI to improve instruction: This involves using AI to create new and more powerful learning opportunities for learners – at all levels of schools and across subject areas as well as instructional contexts.2)Promoting AI Literacy: This involves helping everyone develop sufficient understanding of AI to function in a society where AI is increasingly used.3)Rethinking workforce preparation: This involves responding to the need to change how we prepare future workers, once uses of AI take over functions previously performed by humans in specific occupations.4)Leveraging AI to support educators’ own work: While the focus of the previous three categories is on student learning, here the focus shifts on educators’ using AI in their work to increase their productivity and well-being.In what follows, I will examine each of these areas using conceptual analysis, building on findings from relevant research studies I have been involved in, as well as recent conversations within an interdisciplinary group of faculty, staff and students as part of an internal planning grant for the University of Rochester. For each area, after a brief introduction I will identify and discuss a few key elements; selected illustrations, in most cases reporting findings from relevant research projects, will also be provided in separate “boxes” so they can be read independently.For further information about this paper please contact the author.},

  abstract={The continuous advancement in technology has restructured industries, due to innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) the financial sector endorsing astonishing transformations. This research recognizes the potential of AI in fintech for digital society while focusing on the transition toward Industry 5.0, which is based on human-AI collaboration. AI technologies, such as Artificial Generative Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), are limited in handling intricate, vigorous financial environments. ANI has improved efficiency via credit risk assessment, customer service automation, and fraud detection, whereas AGI aims for more comprehensive decision-making capabilities. ANI and AGI are creating a gap in accomplishing a truly responsive, customer-centric system as it cannot fully adapt to subtle decision-making or erratic market shifts. This paper suggests a Super Artificial Intelligence (SAl) as a promising solution to overcome limitations, standing SAI-based design for a unified nifty digital financial system. Its forward-thinking decision-making proficiencies, self-learning, and flexibility are expected to transmute financial aligned with Industry 5.0's human-centered principles by providing adaptive services, enhancing financial inclusion and personalized. The study identifies key challenges in current AI applications, through a comprehensive review of literature and case studies, such as algorithmic errors and customer facility, and highlights how SAI could offer a more autonomous and ethical approach to financial decision-making. The paper concludes by underscoring the importance of continuous AI validation, ethical considerations, and human oversight to ensure sustainable, secure, and customer-focused financial systems.},

GenAI, by nature, excels at tasks involving the generation of output based on existing information. As a result, jobs that are repetitive, predictable, and don't require deep human intuition are at the highest risk of being affected. Customer service representative is a job that faces one of the highest risks of becoming redundant thanks to GenAI. While GenAI can automate code writing for certain tasks, software development is also about problem&#x2010;solving, design, and understanding human needs &#x2013; areas where humans excel. Generative AI can be used to create music, video content, virtual realities, and even video game elements. Professionals who can harness this tech for creative endeavors are emerging. The effectiveness of GenAI hinges on the quality of data it's trained on.</p>},

  abstract={Data-driven methods based on artificial intelligence technology exhibit the ability to process data quickly and accurately, thus currently being widely applied in the field of power system state estimation (SE). However, recent studies have found that processing data during the training phase of data-driven algorithms can mislead the operational results, demonstrating security risks in data-driven methods. In light of this, to reveal potential security issues in data-driven algorithms, this paper proposes an adversarial attack method based on conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). Experimental results indicate that adding minute disturbances generated by CGAN to target samples can misleads the predictions of SE model. This method directs the attack based on preset label conditions during the model application.},

  year={2023},

  pages={200-211},
  abstract={The traffic data corrupted by noise and missing entries often lead to the poor performance of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), such as the bad congestion prediction and route guidance. How to efficiently impute the traffic data is an urgent problem. As a classic deep learning method, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) achieves remarkable success in image recovery fields, which opens up a new way for the traffic data imputation. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal GAN model for the traffic data imputation (STGAN). Firstly, we design the generative loss and center loss, which not only minimizes the reconstructed errors of the imputed entries, but also ensures each imputed entry and its neighbors conform to the local spatio-temporal distribution. Then, the discriminator uses the convolution neural network classifier to judge whether the imputed matrix conforms to the global spatio-temporal distribution. As for the network architecture of the generator, we introduce the skip-connection to keep all well preserved data unchanged, and employ the dilated convolution to capture the spatio-temporal correlation in the traffic data. The experimental results show that our proposed method obviously outperforms other competitive traffic data imputation methods.},

  year={2025},

  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The rapid evolution of network technologies and frequent network intrusions have amplified the demand for intrusion detection systems (IDSs) powered by artificial intelligence (AI). However, the performance of IDSs is limited by labeled intrusion data and class imbalances in existing datasets. Collecting such data through live network simulations is costly, insecure, and poses regulatory challenges. This paper presents a multi-model framework that uses a conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) to synthesize realistic network intrusion data. The framework addresses challenges such as unstable training, mode collapse, and handling mixed data types, which are common in most generative AI models when applied to non-Gaussian tabular data generation while validating the synthesized data through qualitative and quantitative analyses. Overlaid density histograms and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) are used for qualitative analysis. For quantitative analysis, the train-real-test-synthetic (TRTS) and train-synthetic-test-real (TSTR) methods, as well as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, are utilized. The TRTS and TSTR methods are classifier-based approaches with classification accuracies of 98.36% and 97.95%, respectively, and are used to assess the synthesized intrusion data to ensure the interchangeability of the synthesized intrusion data and real-world intrusion data for training IDSs. The KS test results indicate a similarity score of 0.92 between real and synthesized data. Additionally, to provide interpretable insights into the performance of the model and refrain from using real-world intrusion data for analysis purposes, the framework employs an explainable AI (XAI) approach called local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME), enabling network security analysts to interpret features that influence the intrusive nature of the synthesized network intrusion data while preserving data privacy.},

  abstract={Recently, artificial intelligence is profoundly changing design practice. The relationship between designers and applied artificial intelligence urgently needs a framework and theory to describe and measure. Thus, this article establishes the Brain-Machine-Ratio (BMR) model, which examines the collaborative relationship between the designers and artificial intelligence with the ratio of human and machine labor in the process of design work. The core approach is modeling the proportion of human and AI in seven design tasks on the time dimension. Based on both qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we proposed the concept and statistics of the Brain-Machine-Ratio model and deduced the further collaborative relationship between designers and artificial intelligence.},

  abstract={By integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) has revolutionized many fields. However, AIoT is facing the challenges of energy consumption and carbon emissions due to the continuous advancement of mobile technology. Fortunately, Generative AI (GAI) holds immense potential to reduce carbon emissions of AIoT due to its excellent reasoning and generation capabilities. In this article, we explore the potential of GAI for carbon emissions reduction and propose a novel GAI-enabled solution for low-carbon AIoT. Specifically, we first study the main impacts that cause carbon emissions in AIoT, and then introduce GAI techniques and their relations to carbon emissions. We then explore the application prospects of GAI in low-carbon AIoT, focusing on how GAI can reduce carbon emissions of network components. Subsequently, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled carbon emission optimization framework, in which we design pluggable LLM and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) modules to generate more accurate and reliable optimization problems. Furthermore, we utilize Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) to identify optimal strategies for carbon emission reduction. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we insightfully provide open research directions for low-carbon AIoT.},

One of these fields is in the work fielded by child protection offices. The AId4Children project investigates the use of AI-generated virtual reality (VR) training environments for child protection workers. This VR training application simulates home visits and is generated on synthetically constructed cases of child abuse and neglect that are based on real case files. Using real case files for AI-based generation of VR training raises several ethical, legal, and social aspects (ELSA) and questions. One question Q1) is how to acquire and create an open data set on child endangerment case files. A second question Q2) is how to represent the vulnerable characters in VR respectfully. A third question Q3) is if the use of AI, incl. LLM within the context of child abuse and neglect is acceptable at all. This paper will discuss and provide the first answers to the considerations on ELSA raised by the explorative concept development of this VR training application.},

Leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) like LLaVA and advanced text-to-3D generative models, users can capture images of their surroundings with an Augmented Reality (AR) headset. The system analyzes these images to recommend contextually relevant objects that enhance both functionality and visual appeal. The recommended objects are generated as 3D models and seamlessly integrated into the AR environment for interactive use. Our system utilizes open-source AI models running on local systems to enhance data security and reduce operational costs. Key features include context-aware object suggestions, optimal placement guidance, aesthetic matching, and an intuitive user interface for real-time interaction. Evaluations using the COCO 2017 dataset and real-world AR testing demonstrated high accuracy in object detection and contextual fit rating of 4.1 out of 5.

  abstract={Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in intelligent vehicles rely on accurate driver perception within the vehicle cabin, often leveraging a combination of sensing modalities. However, these modalities operate at varying rates, posing challenges for real-time, comprehensive driver state monitoring. This paper addresses the issue of missing data due to sensor frame rate mismatches, introducing a generative model approach to create synthetic yet realistic thermal imagery. We propose using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), specifically comparing the pix2pix and CycleGAN architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that pix2pix outperforms CycleGAN, and utilizing multi-view input styles, especially stacked views, enhances the accuracy of thermal image generation. Moreover, the study evaluates the model’s generalizability across different subjects, revealing the importance of individualized training for optimal performance. The findings suggest the potential of generative models in addressing missing frames, advancing driver state monitoring for intelligent vehicles, and underscoring the need for continued research in model generalization and customization.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence has unprecedented role in oncology due to which the diagnostic, patient-individualized treatment and predictive analysis aspects have been hit by a breath of fresh perspectives in this field. This survey is being made considering the basic issues and answers already suggested by AI in oncology. There exists a plethora of AI-based learning methods including deep and machine learning, and also hybrid models that have been used on various fronts of cancer care such as detection, prognosis, and drug discovery. The current article points to the positive aspects of AI and it discusses the benefits of AI technology as to the impression that it allows for an accurate prescription, individualized therapy and dealing with big datasets. However, difficulties like interpretability, privacy, and model integration into clinical workflows will continue to be major obstacles. Besides, AI Gone Wild is the dark side of inductive AI. This dilemma identifies the exigency of AI needing quality data and the difficulty of inflecting AI tools into existing healthcare infrastructures as the limitations of the current AI technology. In this context, some future perspectives are put forward; for instance, such include AI luminous radiomics, clinical decision-making with the aid of natural language processing, and the fusion of multi-omics data. This study compares AI models, namely CNNs, Transformers, and ensemble models, to classify and treat cancer. It alleviates shortcomings of dataset biases, ethical concerns, and model explain-ability and it covers a guidance list to initiate the research and development of AI in oncology.},

However, this important and relatively new imaging modality is unfortunately not commonly seen in many well-established image-based dementia datasets, including the ADNI-1/2/3/Go datasets. Hence, synthesizing ASL images to supplement this important modality is valuable. In this study, a new framework based on a cascade of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and difference images generated from a Laplacian pyramid is proposed. This framework is novel as it is the first attempt to incorporate difference images for synthesizing medical images. Experimental results based on a 355-demented patient dataset and ADNI-1 dataset suggest that, this new framework outperforms all state-of-the-arts in ASL image synthesis. Also, synthesized ASL images obtained by this new framework are capable to significantly improve the accuracy of dementia diseases diagnosis performance.},

This study proposes a customized Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework for the generation of anatomically realistic synthetic dental images, focusing on individual tooth-level synthesis from panoramic radiographs. Utilizing a dataset of 612 annotated images categorized according to the FDI tooth notation system, the model was trained separately on cropped single-tooth images and full panoramic views. Architectural innovations such as residual blocks, self-attention modules, and an auxiliary classifier were incorporated to enhance image fidelity and stability. Quantitative evaluation using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) demonstrated superior image quality in single-tooth generation compared to panoramic synthesis, with the best-performing classes achieving FID scores below 100. These results validate the model's potential to augment dental datasets for downstream AI applications, while promoting ethical data practices by reducing the dependency on clinical image acquisition.},

  abstract={In the development of smart cities, consumer electronics, especially cameras, and generative artificial intelligence (GAI), especially large language models (LLMs), are being integrated into agricultural disease prevention. To prevent wheat stripe rust (WSR), an agricultural disease, decision-makers (DMs) need to evaluate disease conditions across different regions and reach a consensus to scientifically select optimal wheat planting regions. However, current group consensus methods struggle with representing multi-source information and lack personalized incentives to engage diverse DMs. Therefore, an LLM-guided group consensus method for the location selection of wheat planting regions (LS-WPR) under structured multi-scale information systems (MSISs) is explored. First, ChatGPT-4o converts wheat images into numerical forms, which is used to build an MSIS by hierarchical clustering and select optimal scale combinations by three-way decisions (TWD). Second, trust weights are calculated via McKinsey trust equation, and quantum-like Bayesian networks (QBNs) model interference among DMs to refine their weights. Third, DMs are classified based on their behavioral characteristics using three-way clustering (TWC), and a personalized behavior optimization mechanism with trust-driven incentive strategies is applied to achieve LS-WPR consensus. Fourth, quantum frameworks are used to maximize differentiation among regions. Finally, the method is validated by experiments to demonstrate its advantages in LS-WPR.},

  abstract={There is always a big influence of robotics and natural language processing in the field of automation. The current scenario of natural language processing (NLP) focuses on machine analysis and machine interpretation. By the term machine analysis, accuracy becomes an important phenomenon. So, it is named Augean that refers to higher accuracy for natural language processing which is difficult to attain involving the use of neural networks. Thus far named as Augean artificial neural network. It is one of the key branches of machine learning which is peculiar from the other branches speculating more towards artificial intelligence. NLP is now one of the key aspects in making machine learn and letting it speak. The current framework of these discusses more of deep learning. One of the biggest challenges is to make the machine learn and speak is known. Thus far processing becomes the most crucial part. Therefore, when it comes to processing there is no better idea than the brain to be involved. Now the current scenario is about making machine learn to the best of the accuracy and if there is something of great accuracy then it involves a real complex algorithm. The machine works possibly best only if the accuracy stays high and stepping on to the precision of work with better learning ability machines are remarkable. So, to frame this, artificial neural network and neuroscience have been used to make the model more robust increasing the accuracy with at least five percent to the previous models involved.},

  title={Enhancing Medical Image Clarity: Introducing L2R-SRGAN for Improved Super-Resolution}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={7},
  number={},
  pages={840-844},
  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen the emergence of Generative Adversarial Networks or abbreviated as GANs, a promising technology that mimics the actual world inputs to generate synthetic data. This capacity is quite promising, especially in the field of biomedical imaging, where increasing the resolution of X-rays and other medical picture data may significantly enhance clinical procedures and diagnosis. However, because medical technology has limits, obtaining high-resolution pictures of medical conditions can be difficult. There are now proven super-resolution (SR) methods available to address this issue. Rebuilding high-resolution images from their low-resolution counterparts is one of these methods, which provides more detailed information necessary for precise target identification. Super-resolution’s primary objective is to raise the image’s perceived quality. Employing generative adversarial network (GAN) based high-resolution representation learning, more precisely the SRGAN model, this study offers a unique approach for SR or super-resolution of medical images. The suggested technique, called L2RSRGAN, improves upon previous models by utilizing GANs’ strengths in maintaining high-frequency picture information and recreating visual quality. Notably, L2 regularization is integrated into the generator’s residual block, which smoothest out artifacts and reduces overfitting to improve the visual quality of generated high-resolution pictures. Our studies’ findings demonstrate that our model is effective in generating high-quality super-resolved medical pictures, with a SSIM or Structural Similarity Index Measure of 0.2098 and PSNR or peak signal-to-noise ratio of 9.18.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) research is becoming a growing trend as a result of recent improvements in machine learning. Development and grasping knowledge of art is perhaps the most subtle field of interest in the ongoing study of the “Human Vs AI” relationship. Several fascinating projects have grown up at the intersection of AI and art, but understanding and appreciating the beauty of art is still thought to be only human capacities. This paper discusses pertinent features and discoveries made by several scholars in the creation of AI art. Many scholars use GAN, but as this field of study continues to advance, many new techniques have emerged, including DALL-E, DALL-E 2, stable diffusion, multi-diffusion, DIFF EDIT, SEMSTYLE, LAFITE, and Mirror GAN. This demonstrates that there are numerous techniques for creating images, but the primary difficulty is deciding which technique is appropriate and used for text to image synthesis. So, we talked about some of the key techniques and their methodology. Three crucial techniques-DALL-E, stable diffusion, and GAN-that serve as the foundation for the creation of artificially intelligent art are discussed. Additionally, we talked about the way they work and fundamental design. Furthermore, there is also a section of the literature review that discusses the work, methodology, and restrictions of 8 researchers' models. These techniques significantly increase public interest in this subject. This paper concludes with highlights of some attractive application of the main theme in the current world.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has progressed so far in human computer interaction that it is much more natural and interesting. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) conjointly with Conversational AI is capable of processing visual alongside the textual input and generating intelligent and context aware responses, and therefore the work on a multimodal chatbot system is introduced in this paper. The proposed system extracts text from images, Natural Language Processing (NLP) processes user queries, and enhances the interaction by speech output through text to speech synthesis. In particular, this chatbot doesn’t accept speech as input modality but tries to translate text response to speech to make the interface more accessible for visually impaired users. Additionally, there is a poster generation module in the system for visual summarization of the conversations and the extracted content. The chatbot uses state of the art deep learning models and language frameworks to handle real time processing, grammatical accuracy in real time and also across different scenarios. From education, assistive technologies, customer support and all the possibilities in between, the applications take advantage of multimodal, voice enriched and visually enhanced communication to include users.},

  abstract={Recently, data has ousted oil as the most economical resource in the world, but most companies are reluctant to share customer/user data in pure form and on a large scale due to privacy concerns. Many innovative technologies (e.g., federated learning, split learning) are employed to meet the growing demand for privacy preservation. Despite these technologies, acquiring personal data in order to optimize utility, and then sharing it on a large scale, is still very challenging. Thanks to the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), a relatively new and promising solution to resolve these challenges is to generate synthetic data (SD) by mirroring the original dataset’s properties. SD is a promising solution to address growing privacy demands as well as the utility/analytics requirements of many industry stakeholders. In this paper, we propose and implement an SD generation method from a real dataset containing both numerical and categorical attributes by using an improved conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), and we quantify the feasibility of SD on technical and theoretical grounds. We provide a detailed analysis of SD in original and anonymized forms with the help of multiple use cases, whereas prior research simply assumed that privacy issues in SD are small because AI models do not overfit or SD has a poor connection with real data. We provide insights into the characteristics of SD (distributions, value frequencies, correlations, etc.) produced by the CGAN in relation to the real data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the pioneering work that provides an experiment-based analysis of the quality, privacy, and utility of SD in relation to a real benchmark dataset.},

  abstract={Data augmentation is an effective method to improve the robustness of embedding based speaker verification systems, which could be applied to either the front-end speaker embedding extractor or the back-end PLDA. Different from the conventional augmentation methods such as manually adding noise or reverberation to the original audios, in this article, we propose to use deep generative models to directly generate more diverse speaker embeddings, which would be used for robust PLDA training. Conditional GAN, and VAE are designed, and investigated for different embedding types, including factor analysis based i-vector, TDNN based x-vector, and ResNet based r-vector. The proposed back-end augmentation methods are evaluated on NIST SRE 2016, and 2018 dataset. Within the popular x-vector, and r-vector framework, the experimental results show that our proposed methods can outperform the traditional audio based back-end augmentation method while different front-end augmentation methods are considered.},

  abstract={Neurological Disorders impact a subject’s/ person’s nervous system in various ways and include a wide range of neurological conditions. More often than not, the impact is life altering and affects the subject’s communication skills, social interaction capability, etc. If the condition is detected at an early age, it can significantly enhance the quality of life of the subject with focused training, treatment, etc. Detection through brain scans, behavioral analysis, etc. are costly and time consuming. Recently artificial intelligence (AI) models are being increasingly used for detection & classification of neurological disorders based on various parameters and datasets. However, for an end user, it’s still very difficult to realize the power of these models end to end viz., from data acquisition to generating recommendations. Hence, in this paper, we present the architecture of an Information Superhighway in the form of AI pipeline. The task of the Information Superhighway is to enable capturing the multimodal data (image, video, etc.) of a subject from a smartphone of a laptop webcam, and send this through a secure information channel to a cloud storage. On the storage, the data is managed using various Big Data technologies and is acted upon by the DL models. The generated recommendations are sent back through a different secure communication channel back to the mobile or laptop. We feel that our work is first of its kind which makes the technology transfer possible for the end user and utilize full the prowess of powerful AI models.},

  abstract={Supply chains for Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are more vulnerable to increasing occurrence of disruption events. These disruptions have a significant impact on their operations’ continuity and performance which results in a loss of customer satisfaction and their market share. Building a resilient SC is a significant challenge for such enterprises due to their limited resources. In this paper, we present the integration of generative AI in a decision-making framework to enhance supply chain resilience (SCR) for SMEs. The ability of Artificial intelligence to generate new scenarios and analyze large data has been integrated at different stages of the decision-making framework. Starting from the initial stage of the framework, AI-generated novel scenarios aid in risk identification. Later, the decision-making framework can get insights from AI in order to trigger optimal mitigation strategies. The AI-integrated framework aims to speed up the decision-making process by identifying, analyzing, and evaluating optimal mitigation strategies to overcome disruption risks and to achieve the objective of SC resilience. Our study provides a practical tool for SMEs to achieve resiliency for their SCs.},

Empirical validation was conducted using data collected from 326 participants in the southeast of Chinese Mainland. The results of structural equation modeling indicated that: 1) Factors such as effort expectancy, price value, and hedonic motivation from UTAUT2 have a positive influence on the intention to use GenAI, while performance expectancy does not show a statistically significant effect. 2) Both optimism and creativity significantly contribute to performance expectancy, effort expectancy, price value, and hedonic motivation. 3) Trait curiosity has a significant positive impact on both optimism and the intention to use GenAI. The research findings suggest the need for further improvements in the construction and operational strategies of GenAI platforms and provide practical insights for enhancing Generation Z’s intention to utilize such platforms.},

  abstract={Medical image synthesis is gaining popularity using generative models. latent diffusion models have recently shown promise in producing remarkably life-like representations of items. However, their ability to produce medical imagery has not yet been investigated. We investigate the possibility of latent diffusion models for the synthesis of different medical modalities. Initially, we create MRI images of the brains using a pre-trained DALLE-3 model given an input text prompt. Second, we create synthetic images and use 2300 MRI and 1300 CT images to train a stable diffusion model. Through a qualitative study, we assess the synthetic image data by having two impartial specialists MRI and CT modalities to classify randomly selected samples from the created data as authentic (real), fraudulent (phony), or unclear. Findings show that images produced using the diffusion model can convey qualities that are otherwise highly specific to certain medical conditions in MRI and CT modalities. This paper aims to introduce diffusion models rather than state-of-the-art generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and provide impetus for the medical image synthesis research community to investigate their possibilities.},

The current study examines the crucial role of AI, i.e., via machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), in transforming our knowledge, modeling, and use of proteins in therapeutic design. Such breakthrough frameworks as AlphaFold and RosettaFold have shown AI's unmatched ability to predict protein structures at experimental accuracy, minimizing time and expense associated with conventional means. Furthermore, AI's assistance in the discovery of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and drug repurposing has presented novel avenues to boost drug discovery and enhance current drugs. The combination of multi- omics data has augmented the contribution of AI to personalized medicine to facilitate the design of protein-based therapies for individual patients to optimize therapeutic effects. Nevertheless, issues such as data quality, model interpretability, and constraints on computing power continue to hinder the extensive use of AI in protein discovery. Ethical considerations, such as data protection and transparency of AI models in clinical environments, need to be addressed with caution. Future work needs to focus on enhancing model interpretability, enriching dataset quality, and promoting the use of AI models with conventional experimental frameworks to unlock AI's transformative potential in the battle against disease and the expansion of precision medicine.},

  abstract={Mobile-edge computing (MEC) is a new computing paradigm that enables cloud computing and information technology (IT) services to be delivered at the network’s edge. By shifting the load of cloud computing to individual local servers, MEC helps meet the requirements of ultralow latency, localized data processing, and extends the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) for end-users. However, the crosscutting nature of MEC and the multidisciplinary components necessary for its deployment have presented additional security and privacy concerns. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can cope with excessively unpredictable and complex data, which offers a distinct advantage in dealing with sophisticated and developing adversaries in the security industry. Hence, in this article, we comprehensively provide a survey of security and privacy in MEC from the perspective of AI. On the one hand, we use European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) MEC reference architecture as our-based framework while merging the software-defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) to better illustrate a serviceable platform of MEC. On the other hand, we focus on new security and privacy issues, as well as potential solutions from the viewpoints of AI. Finally, we comprehensively discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with applying AI to MEC security and privacy as possible future research directions.},

The initial investigation aimed at integrating A.I.G.C. courses into the D.C.A. curriculum involved a series of AI-centric lectures and an extensive survey involving 92 students. The findings revealed a preference for elective A.I.G.C. courses, with most favoring lecture-based delivery over full curriculum integration. These results underscore the need for a balanced approach that respects traditional artistic values while embracing technological advancements. Furthermore, the second study focused on the “Summer Sunshine” project, employing Stable Diffusion and LoRA models to achieve high fidelity and consistency in manga production. This case study illustrated the practical efficiencies of A.I.G.C., from reducing manual labor to enhancing artistic quality, thereby setting new standards for A.I.'s role in graphic arts. Overall, the studies highlight the potential benefits and challenges of embedding A.I. art courses into curricula and demonstrate the effective use of A.I. in manga production through A.I.G.C. technologies. The findings from these investigations prompt broader discussions about the role of A.I. in art, advocating for policies that support ethical practices and nurture the coexistence of A.I. and traditional artistic methods.},

  abstract={Advancements in information technology and the widespread use of the Internet have radically transformed global communication. Yet, these breakthroughs have also intensified challenges related to privacy and data security, particularly as sensitive information is exchanged across digital channels. In response, our research introduces a novel method that leverages artificial intelligence to conceal textual data within images, thereby enhancing security and confidentiality in digital communications. This study proposes an innovative approach where AI is employed to generate high-quality images from scratch, rather than relying on pre-existing cover images. These AI-generated images serve as secure carriers for encrypted messages, ensuring that the process not only maintains optimal image quality but also minimizes the risk of detection. A distinctive feature of our methodology is the application of RGB color masking, which preserves the visual integrity of the image while intricately embedding the hidden text. Moreover, our approach supports the encryption and concealment of Arabic text, broadening its applicability and reinforcing its relevance in diverse linguistic contexts. To evaluate the efficacy of our technique, we utilize rigorous quantitative measures such as distortion levels, accuracy of data retrieval, and detection rates. Preliminary results indicate that our method achieves superior speed, enhanced confidentiality, and significantly lower detectability when compared to traditional and modern techniques. Additionally, by integrating a mix of AI models, our approach optimizes the encryption and embedding processes, paving the way for more robust and versatile applications in digital security. Ultimately, this research not only addresses critical issues of data privacy and secure communication but also establishes a new paradigm in the field of steganography and encryption. By merging cutting-edge AI technology with advanced image processing techniques, our work lays the groundwork for more secure digital communication systems for digital security actors such as government agencies, schools, telecom providers, and messaging platforms can adopt the proposed methodology for integrating text hiding in different languages into AI-generated images, enabling a secure communication channel with high confidentiality and low vulnerability. This technology can also be easily integrated into existing encryption systems to enhance the protection of sensitive data without compromising image quality or network performance. And invites further exploration into innovative security solutions for the future.},

  abstract={The emergence of Generative AI (GenAI) has posed significant challenges to various institutions since its launch. The education sector, in particular, requires an urgent regulatory framework. This work provides guidelines for the incorporation of GenAI into the teaching-learning process of undergraduate students, in which generative tools are promising to revolutionize both their academic and professional trajectories. Despite ongoing debates among Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) decision-makers on whether GenAI should be used for education, students are at odds on the prohibition of its use. Instead, they promptly provided specific recommendations for their peers, after a workshop on AI basics, GenAI applications, and analysis. Five student groups of divergent engineering fields collaboratively proposed usage guidelines for ChatGPT in the learning-teaching process. The authors categorized, compared, and consolidated these into a Decalogue of Use. Employing a qualitative methodology, these guidelines were contrasted with those issued by four institutions: UNESCO, Universidad de los Andes, University of Wisconsin–Madison, and Universidad Iberoamericana. Notably, these institutions concurred with students in only five out of the ten guidelines. These guidelines are of broad nature and therefore applicable across various sectors within HEIs. HEIs, as other governmental and international institutions, have been lagging in developing and implementing regulatory frameworks for GenAI, in contrast to the rapid advancement of this technology. This work offers valuable insights into students’ perceptions of GenAI use. Such evidence is instrumental for HEIs in making informed decisions regarding the regulations of these tools. Our findings encourage not only HEIs but also organizations and decision-makers to propagate the debate about ethical GenAI usage to different societal sectors. Promisingly, working as a community will empower us to make the best and pertinent decisions regarding the adoption of GenAI and other future emergent technologies.},
