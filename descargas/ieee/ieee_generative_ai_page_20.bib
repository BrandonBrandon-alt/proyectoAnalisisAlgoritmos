  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed personalized wellness platforms, yet challenges remain in adaptability, privacy, and user engagement. This paper introduces a Self-Healing Digital Twin Framework, integrating Hybrid Generative AI, Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based self-healing, and Privacy-Preserving AI (PPAI) to address these gaps. Unlike static Digital Twin models, our approach dynamically learns from multi-modal Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and wearable data, ensuring real-time adaptation and privacy compliance via a dual-cloud architecture that eliminates raw data exposure. Validation through simulations and real-world deployment confirms the system’s ability to track user health trends, detect anomalies, and optimize interventions for improved engagement and wellness outcomes. The RL-driven self-healing mechanism continuously refines recommendations, enhancing adherence. Our findings establish this framework as a scalable and privacy-secure AI-driven solution for intelligent, adaptive healthcare.},

  abstract={The effective generation of synthetic time-series data is crucial for addressing data scarcity in various domains such as network monitoring, financial analysis, and healthcare. This study explores image-based approaches for transforming time-series data into visual representations, enabling the application of advanced image synthesis techniques. We systematically evaluate multiple transformation methods, including recurrence plots, Gramian Angular Fields (GAF), and Markov transition fields, to identify the most suitable techniques for preserving temporal and structural characteristics. The generated synthetic data are validated using statistical similarity metrics and tested on machine learning tasks, such as anomaly detection and forecasting, to assess their practical utility. Experimental results demonstrate that image-based synthetic data generation not only retains essential time-series features but also enhances model robustness under limited data conditions. This research contributes to the growing field of synthetic data generation by providing insights into the integration of time-series and image processing techniques. Future work will focus on refining these methods and exploring their scalability across diverse applications.},

  abstract={With the continuous development of artificial intelligence, cross-field applications in image recognition, natural language processing, and semantic recognition have gradually emerged. Video subtitle generation is one of the typical cross-field application scenarios. By recognizing image semantics and using natural language for generative content construction, users can often understand the content of images intuitively and quickly. In addition, when the contents are displayed in text form, it is convenient for textual retrieval or other text-based image applications. This paper proposes the application of generative adversarial networks in subtitle recognition. By focusing more on generation diversity, the degree of the differentiated description of generated content can be further improved, making image and video subtitles generation content prone to human habits. Specifically, the idea is to use the generative adversarial network to generate the subtitles of the images in the video and use diversified generative models to conduct difference optimization to obtain better generative performance. It is hoped that the research in this paper can help the application of diversified video subtitles generation.},

  title={CycleGAN*: Collaborative AI Learning With Improved Adversarial Neural Networks for Multimodalities Data}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={5},
  number={11},
  pages={5616-5629},
  abstract={With the widespread adoption of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for sample generation, this article aims to enhance adversarial neural networks to facilitate collaborative artificial intelligence (AI) learning which has been specifically tailored to handle datasets containing multimodalities. Currently, a significant portion of the literature is dedicated to sample generation using GANs, with the objective of enhancing the detection performance of machine learning (ML) classifiers through the incorporation of these generated data into the original training set via adversarial training. The quality of the generated adversarial samples is contingent upon the sufficiency of training data samples. However, in the multimodal domain, the scarcity of multimodal data poses a challenge due to resource constraints. In this article, we address this challenge by proposing a new multimodal dataset generation approach based on the classical audio–visual speech recognition (AVSR) task, utilizing CycleGAN, DiscoGAN, and StyleGAN2 for exploration and performance comparison. AVSR experiments are conducted using the LRS2 and LRS3 corpora. Our experiments reveal that CycleGAN, DiscoGAN, and StyleGAN2 do not effectively address the low-data state problem in AVSR classification. Consequently, we introduce an enhanced model, CycleGAN*, based on the original CycleGAN, which efficiently learns the original dataset features and generates high-quality multimodal data. Experimental results demonstrate that the multimodal datasets generated by our proposed CycleGAN* exhibit significant improvement in word error rate (WER), indicating reduced errors. Notably, the images produced by CycleGAN* exhibit a marked enhancement in overall visual clarity, indicative of its superior generative capabilities. Furthermore, in contrast to traditional approaches, we underscore the significance of collaborative learning. We implement co-training with diverse multimodal data to facilitate information sharing and complementary learning across modalities. This collaborative approach enhances the model’s capability to integrate heterogeneous information, thereby boosting its performance in multimodal environments.},

  abstract={Amid the era of rapid integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into diverse applications, such as anomaly detection in heterogeneous graphs, the pursuit of interpretable and dependable decision-making models has gained paramount significance. The comprehension of the rationale behind GNN predictions proves vital for instilling trust in their outcomes. While existing GNN explanation methods have made progress in this domain, their ability to provide precise and authentic explanations remains limited. To address these deficiencies, a novel approach named “GANEnhanced Explainability” (GEE) is introduced, built upon the foundation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GEE comprises a dual-component architecture: a generator responsible for producing explanations and a discriminator facilitating the refinement of the explanation generation process. Additionally, this research extends this foundation by incorporating innovative visualization techniques to augment the interpretability of GNN-based anomaly detection, thereby forging a new path in the realm of explainable AI for intricate graph structures.},

  abstract={As AI systems increasingly influence critical sectors like telecommunications, finance, healthcare, and public services, ensuring fairness in decision-making is essential to prevent biased or unjust outcomes that disproportionately affect vulnerable entities or result in adverse impacts. This need is particularly pressing as the industry approaches the 6G era, where AI will drive complex functions like autonomous network management and hyper-personalized services. The TEC Standard for Fairness Assessment and Rating of AI Systems provides guidelines for evaluating fairness in AI, focusing primarily on tabular data and supervised learning models. However, as AI applications diversify, this standard requires enhancement to strengthen its impact and broaden its applicability. This paper proposes an expansion of the TEC Standard to include fairness assessments for images, unstructured text, and generative AI, including large language models, ensuring a more comprehensive approach that keeps pace with evolving AI technologies. By incorporating these dimensions, the enhanced framework will promote responsible and trustworthy AI deployment across various sectors.},

  abstract={With the proliferation of user-friendly generative-AI tools, many government agencies, such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, have started exploring how these tools could improve one of their primary functions: managing grant programs to distribute funds for research. Government bans on the use of generative-AI for initial grant application evaluation limits the use of this technology. However, this research shows that a post hoc evaluative approach within the domain of Responsible AI provides a means by which government agencies can evaluate the big data collected through their grant programs. This proposed framework, Responsible AI for Evaluation (RAI-E), achieves this goal by curating big governmental administrative data using grant evaluation rubrics followed by model fine-tuning for agency-specific evaluation tasks. Convergence between model- and human-generated evaluations then enables robust diagnosis of grant program equity and fairness via Responsible AI and algorithm auditing methods. Preliminary experiments show improved model performance through the instruction-tuning of open source language models for evaluating government grant applications. Further research will explore the auditing of the underlying algorithms, devising a method for algorithm-in-the-loop frameworks to aid government administrators in evaluating their human-driven program performance.},

Thus, this project leverages the power of GANs to create a model capable of accurately predicting the aging progression of facial images. This problem was studied by using Generative Models and, more specifically, Generative Adversarial Networks. Traditional methods often struggle with the intricate transformations faces undergo over time, however, GANs have emerged as a powerful tool for generating realistic images, making them ideal for this task, achieving a highest accuracy of 96%.},

  abstract={Glaucoma investigations play an important role in glaucoma management. This study aimed to generate a visual field pattern deviation map (GenVF) from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN), namely GenVFNet. cGAN consisted of two components: generator and discriminator. The generator consisted of encoder and decoder blocks and the discriminator was the classification learner. The training data was Grad-CAM of OCTA (GradOCTA) of glaucomatous eyes. Only eyes with a visual field (VF) compatible with optic disc photograph (DP) and/or optical coherence tomography (OCT) were used. 100 eyes (90.9%) were used for training and the remaining 10 eyes (9.1%) for testing. To conform with the five severity levels in clinical diagnosis, we quantized the generated VF (GenRawVF) from GenVFNet into five levels and named the quantized image GenVF. In the experiment, GenRawVFs were compared with actual pattern deviation images (RealRawVF) using the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), Fréchet inception distance (FID), and confusion matrix. The average  $\times 95$ %CI SSIM, NRMSE, and FID were  $0.87\times 0.02$ ,  $0.10\times 0.6$ , and  $7.54\times 3.47$ , respectively. GenVFNet was able to construct GenVF, especially in the superior hemifield. In addition, GenVFNet was tested with VFs of eyes whose DP and/or OCT did not correlate with the available VF. According to the expert’s opinion, 81 eyes (65.8%) of GenVF were correlated with DP and/or OCT. This study demonstrated the potential of GenVFNet to construct a VF pattern deviation from the OCTA that would be a benefit for patients who cannot perform a reliable VF.},

  pages={114-118},
  abstract={Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is a non-invasive method for detecting ischemic stroke disease and is widely used in clinical diagnosis. Due to the obvious imbalance of medical data, oversampling is needed to balance it. Although the oversampling method is one of the important means to solve the problem of imbalanced data classification, the traditional oversampling method will inevitably introduce noise, which will affect the classification results. To address this issue, we proposed a new oversampling method combining the membership function (MF) and the variational autoencoder (VAE). Our method utilized VAE as a generative model to generate new samples to reduce the Imbalance Ratio (IR) of the dataset. Then the new samples are filtered using MF to weaken the impact of the noise introduced by the oversampling method on classification performance. In addition, in view of the weak adaptability of traditional MFs to complex sample distributions in practical applications, a new MF is proposed by using kernel function mapping and hypersphere. The classification experiments on TCD imbalanced dataset prove that the oversampling method we proposed has improved classification performance on multiple evaluation criteria compared with traditional oversampling methods.},

  abstract={In recent years, the combination of artificial intelligence and power systems has been increasing. However, the collection of image datasets of power equipment is limited by places and environments, so the number of collected datasets is relatively small, which makes it unable to provide sufficient data support for specific applications. We propose to use Generative Adversarial Networks to generate images of electrical equipment from existing sparse datasets, thereby increasing the size of the electrical equipment dataset. In this paper, three generative adversarial networks with different structures are used to generate images of insulator and to assess the caliber of images produced by the three models, the analysis of loss function image and FID score of generated images is performed.},

  abstract={Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are critical to authentication and assurance of integrated circuits (ICs), by leveraging inherent manufacturing process variations in the semiconductor chips to generate unique Challenge-Response Pairs (CRPs). This research investigates the susceptibility of FPGA based Ring Oscillator Physical Unclonable Function (ROPUF) by predicting its CRPs using machine learning models and Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI). An essential component of this research is identifying potential security risks to prevent the incorporation of vulnerable components into secure applications. In this paper, we consider a plausible scenario where an adversary illicitly acquires 5% of the CRP dataset, and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic CRPs that are subsequently added to augment the training dataset by $35 \%$. With this augmented data, machine learning models demonstrate a notable improvement in predictive accuracy. Decision Tree (DT) prediction accuracy increases from 60.17% to 67.15%, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from $64.67 \%$ to $72.17 \%$, Random Forest Classifier (RF) from $67.83 \%$ to $75.74 \%$, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) from $\mathbf{7 3. 8 3 \%}$ to $\mathbf{8 3. 4 1 \%}$. This enhanced predictive capability reveals that machine learning models even with partial datasets augmented using GAN models can predict the original CRPs with increased accuracy.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-14},
  abstract={Time series are widely used in many classification and regression tasks. However, numerous time series contain unavoidable missing data, making it challenging to model the temporal dynamics of sequential data. Various data imputation methods have been proposed to infer missing values in time series. Although sequences recorded at fixed time intervals are presented in discrete form, they possess an inherent temporal continuity, which is ignored in most existing approaches. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Attentive Continuous-Time Generative Adversarial Network (ACGANet) to estimate unobserved values in irregular sequences. ACGANet captures the temporal dynamics by transforming the discrete sequence into the continuous-time flow, thereby modeling the underlying distribution of the real data. Furthermore, ACGANet employs an adversarial learning strategy to alleviate the error introduced by imputed values, with the discriminator distinguishing between real and generated samples. Additionally, ACGANet introduces the log-density of hidden temporal states as an auxiliary loss to further optimize the generator. This allows the model to simultaneously focus on the overall temporal dynamics of the time series and the underlying distribution of the missing data. Extensive experiments on three publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that ACGANet achieves state-of-the-art performance in imputing incomplete time series. Moreover, both qualitative and quantitative analyses validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has demonstrated its benefits for students learning English as a foreign language (EFL). However, this does not mean teachers are obsolete when AI in education (AIED) is employed. Grounded in self-determination theory and the holistic integration approach, this study explored the significance of human agency in AIED to measure three learning outcomes: students' intrinsic motivation, classroom anxiety, and willingness to communicate in EFLclasses. Its findings suggest that students who received human-centered teacher-student-GenAI collaboration developed better in all three areas than those who only had student-GenAI interactions. Moreover, the holistic integration approach promoted teacher immediacy and teacher-student rapport that supported students' development. In a climate where an instrumentalist view of education is prevalent and digital devices are commonly banned, this study interpreted the changing roles of EFL teachers under AIED systems, suggesting ways that students can benefit from both technological advancements and human agency in education.},

  abstract={The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has become a fundamental platform for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) and Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs). However, the increasing volume of data generated by vehicle sensors and the computational demands of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms present significant challenges for the platform. Edge Intelligence (EI), which brings intelligent computing and data processing closer to vehicles, has emerged as a potential solution. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of Edge Intelligence for the Internet of Vehicles. We begin by discussing the motivations behind employing EI in the IoV for typical AI computations. To fully exploit the potential of EI in heterogeneous IoV environments, we present a layered vehicular EI architecture and discuss its benefits and challenges. Furthermore, we provide a taxonomy of EI approaches for vehicular networks, focusing on cooperative inference, distributed training, and collaborative sensing, in terms of their schemas and advanced frameworks. Finally, we explore emerging trends and research directions in this field, including vehicle-road-cloud integration, generative AI-driven IoV, and vehicular cyber-physical fusion. By offering insights into state-of-the-art techniques and trends, this survey aims to enable researchers to develop innovative solutions for transforming the intelligent IoV ecosystem.},

  abstract={Recognizing the tremendous improvements that the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) can bring to intelligent transportation systems, this article explores the integration of generative AI technologies in vehicular networks, focusing on their potential applications and challenges. Generative AI, with its capabilities of generating realistic data and facilitating advanced decision-making processes, enhances various applications when combined with vehicular networks, such as navigation optimization, traffic prediction, data generation, and evaluation. Despite these promising applications, the integration of generative AI with vehicular networks faces several challenges, such as real-time data processing and decision-making, adapting to dynamic and unpredictable environments, as well as privacy and security concerns. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-modality semantic-aware framework to enhance the service quality of generative AI. By leveraging multi-modal and semantic communication technologies, the framework enables the use of text and image data for creating multi-modal content, providing more reliable guidance to receiving vehicles and ultimately improving system usability and efficiency. To further improve the reliability and efficiency of information transmission and reconstruction within the framework, taking generative AI-enabled vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) as a case study, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach is proposed for resource allocation. Finally, we discuss potential research directions and anticipated advancements in the field of generative AI-enabled vehicular networks.},

  abstract={In recent years, remarkable progress in zero-shot learning (ZSL) has been achieved by generative adversarial networks (GAN). To compensate for the lack of training samples in ZSL, a surge of GAN architectures have been developed by human experts through trial-and-error testing. Despite their efficacy, however, there is still no guarantee that these hand-crafted models can consistently achieve good performance across diversified datasets or scenarios. Accordingly, in this paper, we turn to neural architecture search (NAS) and make the first attempt to bring NAS techniques into the ZSL realm. Specifically, we propose a differentiable GAN architecture search method over a specifically designed search space for zero-shot learning, referred to as ZeroNAS. Considering the relevance and balance of the generator and discriminator, ZeroNAS jointly searches their architectures in a min-max player game via adversarial training. Extensive experiments conducted on four widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that ZeroNAS is capable of discovering desirable architectures that perform favorably against state-of-the-art ZSL and generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) approaches.

  abstract={Image-to-Image translation in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) has been a central focus of research, with applications spanning healthcare, remote sensing, physics, chemistry, photography, and more. Among the numerous methodologies, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with contrastive learning have been particularly successful. This study aims to demonstrate that the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) can effectively replace the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) method in generative AI, particularly in the subdomain of image-to-image translation, to achieve better generative quality. Our novel approach replaces the two-layer MLP with a two-layer KAN in the existing Contrastive Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation (CUT) model, developing the KAN-CUT model. This substitution favors the generation of more informative features in low-dimensional vector representations, which contrastive learning can utilize more effectively to produce high-quality images in the target domain. Extensive experiments, detailed in the results section, demonstrate the applicability of KAN in conjunction with contrastive learning and GANs in Generative AI, particularly for image-to-image translation. This work suggests that KAN could be a valuable component in the broader generative AI domain.},

  abstract={In recent years there have been significant advances in autonomous systems. Because they operate in complex and dynamic environments, these systems often integrate machine learning (ML)-based components, especially at the perception level. However, high-performance ML solutions require considerable amounts of data, and the resulting models are highly dependent on the training data. These models often leverage hidden patterns, known as dataset bias, that are not related to the concept that is being modeled, which, among other issues, limits the generalization and robustness of the models. Within the perception (images) domain, models trained on a specific dataset often fail to generalize to new datasets, despite the underlying concepts being the same. While various techniques have been proposed, such as diversity strategies, they fail to address the different biases in the data. This paper focuses on the issue of dataset biases for pedestrian classification, a core task for safety-critical autonomous systems. We evaluate the ML model’s generalization on four public reference datasets, along with the use of diversity strategies. To address the dataset biases, we then explore the use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) techniques.

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is seen as an efficient way to enhance architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) organizations through the generation of novel content and the automation of processes and tasks. Rapid advancement in GenAI is giving rise to new potential applications in AEC organizations, and this requires a detailed understanding and a strategic planning technique to evaluate the usefulness of GenAI to organizations. This study aims to address this gap by examining GenAI literature in the AEC industry to determine how GenAI contributes to the enhancement of AEC organizations. To achieve the aim, this article identifies how GenAI is used in AEC organizations, and proposes a strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats (SWOT) process and elements for the strategic evaluation of GenAI in AEC organizations. The research methodology consists of a systematic review process. The findings categorized 79 journal articles and conference papers, which revealed that GenAI was being explored to create architectural and structural designs of buildings, optimize construction processes, and enhance risk management and work safety. There are limitations in the capability of GenAI models to meet project management needs. These include low quality datasets used for training, cost, time, and computation resources required to implement GenAI effectively, and ethics and privacy issues when using GenAI in AEC organizations and projects. Additionally, a SWOT process is proposed, and twenty SWOT elements are developed and described: four elements for strengths, five elements for weaknesses, five elements for opportunities, and six elements for threats. The proposed elements aim at providing a foundation for AEC organizations to assess and achieve their strategic GenAI implementation goals. This article identifies the areas of research focus along with a SWOT process and elements that may be useful to researchers and industry practitioners focusing on GenAI and SWOT in the AEC industry.},

  abstract={Explainable decision-making is a key component for compliance with regulatory frameworks and winning trust among end users. In this work, we propose to understand the mis-classification of automotive radar images through counterfactual explanations obtained from generative adversarial networks. The proposed method enables perturbations of original radar images belonging to a query class to result in counterfactual images that are classified as the distractor class. The key requirement is that the perturbations must result in realistic images that belong to the original distribution of the query class and also provide physics-based insights into the causes of the misclassification. We test the methods on simulated automotive inverse synthetic aperture radar data images for a query class of a four-wheel mid-size car and a distractor class of a three-wheel auto-rickshaw. Our results show that the shadowing of one or more wheels of the query class is most likely to result in misclassification.},

  abstract={Human-operated submersibles can guide visitors on explorations of the deep sea. Nevertheless, unknown factors that cause submersible failures may lead to their vanishing. Hence, it is crucial to develop models that can forecast the whereabouts of lost underwater vessels. This work focuses on the problem of lost submersible search, locating, and other difficulties encountered in deep-sea situations where submersibles have power and communication failures. We utilize principles from fluid mechanics to create a sophisticated submersible model that predicts the position of a submersible. Taking into account the decrease in buoyancy in deep-sea environments, we utilize ArcGIS simulation to obtain the influence of various factors on the movement of the target underwater vessel, resulting in precise location forecasting. We calculate the most efficient search area to establish the locations along the search path. By employing a genetic algorithm, we formulate the most efficient search trajectory, progressively modifying the search area. Lastly, we calculate the likelihood of locating the submersible based on the passage of time and the accumulation of search out-comes. Essentially, this work utilizes principles derived from fluid mechanics and geographical mathematics to develop several models that handle numerous issues that have an impact. During the search phase, additional factors are provided to ascertain the minimum range. The submersible models exhibited in this work undergo computer simulation validation, showcasing their practical value. To a certain degree, they possess the ability to anticipate the whereabouts of submerged vessels that are lost, therefore shortening the duration of search and rescue operations.},

  abstract={Biomedical inside body wireless data transfer interface includes the design of power amplifiers (PAs) with implantable antenna leading to operate concurrently. Hence, active and passive devices are utilized simultaneously for which the accurate starting points for designing these high dimensional devices is critical. From another point of view, accelerating the design and optimization process is another substantial issue that must be considered effectively. In this study, we propose a methodology that includes two optimization phases that are applied sequentially. In the first phase, the PA is designed and optimized by employing a generative adversarial network (GAN) for predicting the load-pull contours on the Smith chart and using a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep neural network (DNN) for achieving the optimal design parameters of the biomedical amplifier. In this step, the GAN leads to predicting the optimal impedances needed to construct the initial structure of PA through a simplified real frequency technique. In the second optimization phase, the initial structure of the biomedical antenna is constructed automatically by developing a visual basic environment, then like the PA, the design parameters of the antenna are optimized through the LSTM-based DNN. Finally, another GAN is generated for predicting the radiation patterns of the antenna. In both phases, a multiobjective ant lion optimizer is employed in the output layer of DNNs for optimizing various outcome specifications. The proposed method is performed fully automatically: active and passive devices are designed and optimized with the help of GANs and DNNs in which the drawback of heavy reliance of the system performance on the designer's experience is solved in a fast way. The proposed method is validated by designing and optimizing a biomedical PA with an antenna working at the center frequency of 2.45 GHz which shows reliable outcomes.},

  abstract={With the advancement of massive multiple-input multiple-output (Ma-MIMO) technology, channel estimation becomes increasingly challenging, especially for antennas that are equipped with only one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Deep learning (DL) methods, including the current best-performing conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), face significant challenges in accurately estimating the channel due to inadequately studied and designed loss functions.In this paper, we design a conditional generative adversarial network with a Transformer structure (TransGAN) to create more realistic channels, training two deep learning networks through adversarial training. TransGAN not only learns a mapping from the quantized received signal to the actual channel but also derives an adaptive loss function that enhances the network’s performance. Simulation results show that the TransGAN method designed in this paper is superior to the current DL method in terms of both performance and robustness.},

  abstract={Money laundering not only facilitates the perpetration of dangerous and illegal activities it also damages the credibility and integrity of the global financial system and the financial institutions through whom money is laundered. Despite most financial institutions adhering to prevailing laws and regulations designed to prevent the practice of money laundering, it has been difficult to stop illicit activity using conventional methods. Hence, to combat money laundering, financial institutions are increasingly focused on the adoption of new technologies involving the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). One barrier to adoption of these new techniques for anti-money laundering (AML), however, is the need to maintain the confidentiality of the massive quantities of data required to train AI models, a financial data is the subject of regulatory controls and a target for cyber threat actors. In response to these challenges, this paper presents a secure and scalable architecture for AI implementation that uses confidential computing technology to provide complete end-to-end protection of sensitive financial data and the intellectual property of AML algorithm developers. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are demonstrated using cloud infrastructure secured using Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX). The reported solution architecture can be adapted to support federated machine learning (FML), at scale, between mutually distrusting institutions, with independent control of data security at rest, in transit, and in use by individual data owners.},

  abstract={Humans possess an astonishing ability to understand stories presented in text and to create related images through imagination. This cognitive ability aids in comprehension and enhances overall enjoyment. Consequently, developing automated systems that generate visually faithful images based on textual descriptions is considered a meaningful endeavor. As a result, many artificial intelligence (AI) systems for generating images from text have been developed. In previous research, we presented a study on generating images while maintaining the context of input sentences when multiple sentences are input. In this paper, we propose that when dealing with more structured and numerous sentences, such as those found in novels, essays, or papers, it is essential not only to maintain the consistency of the context but also to address the complex challenge of transitioning between different contexts, which cannot be resolved by merely dividing sentences into paragraphs. We introduce the Structured Context Retention Methods (SCRM) scheme, which reflects the user’s intentions for both context retention and smooth transitions across varying narrative elements. Additionally, through experiments, we demonstrate that the SCRM technique performs well in terms of ROUGE recall, effectively managing a large number of input sentences and context transitions.},

  abstract={The end-to-end learning pipeline is gradually creating a paradigm shift in the ongoing development of highly autonomous vehicles (AVs), largely due to advances in deep learning, the availability of large-scale training datasets, and improvements in integrated sensor devices. However, a lack of explainability in real-time decisions with contemporary learning methods impedes user trust and attenuates the widespread deployment and commercialization of such vehicles. Moreover, the issue is exacerbated when these vehicles are involved in or cause traffic accidents. Consequently, explainability in end-to-end autonomous driving is essential to build trust in vehicular automation. With that said, automotive researchers have not yet rigorously explored safety benefits and consequences of explanations in end-to-end autonomous driving. This paper aims to bridge the gaps between these topics and seeks to answer the following research question: What are safety implications of explanations in end-to-end autonomous driving? In this regard, we first revisit established safety and explainability concepts in end-to-end driving. Furthermore, we present critical case studies and show the pivotal role of explanations in enhancing driving safety. Finally, we describe insights from empirical studies and reveal potential value, limitations, and caveats of practical explainable AI methods with respect to their potential impacts on safety of end-to-end driving.},

  abstract={Recently, generative adversarial networks U+0028 GANs U+0029 have become a research focus of artificial intelligence. Inspired by two-player zero-sum game, GANs comprise a generator and a discriminator, both trained under the adversarial learning idea. The goal of GANs is to estimate the potential distribution of real data samples and generate new samples from that distribution. Since their initiation, GANs have been widely studied due to their enormous prospect for applications, including image and vision computing, speech and language processing, etc. In this review paper, we summarize the state of the art of GANs and look into the future. Firstly, we survey GANs U+02BC proposal background, theoretic and implementation models, and application fields. Then, we discuss GANs U+02BC advantages and disadvantages, and their development trends. In particular, we investigate the relation between GANs and parallel intelligence, with the conclusion that GANs have a great potential in parallel systems research in terms of virtual-real interaction and integration. Clearly, GANs can provide substantial algorithmic support for parallel intelligence.},

  abstract={Abstract The rapid and successful advances of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer security researchers and practitioners new approaches and platforms to explore and investigate challenging issues emerging in many safety&#x2010;critical systems. Those AI/ML&#x2010;enabled solutions have boosted the efficiency and effectiveness of multiple important security applications. While AI and ML can be adopted to identify threats more accurately and prevent cyberattacks more efficiently, cybersecurity professionals must respond to the increasingly sophisticated attacks from adversaries. Modern intelligent networking systems have been maliciously manipulated, evaded, and misled, causing significant security incidents in financial systems, cyber&#x2010;physical systems, and many other critical domains. This chapter provides a background of cybersecurity in the era of AI. First, the use of AI for cybersecurity and the main workflow are introduced. They are followed by the key areas and challenges in data&#x2010;driven cybersecurity, including anomaly detection, trustworthy AI, and privacy preservation. The toolbox for building secure and intelligent systems is then presented to offer the practical guide by using ML, deep learning, privacy&#x2010;preserving ML, and adversarial ML. Lastly, a few data repositories for cybersecurity research, such as intrusion detection and malware detection, are introduced.},

  abstract={As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into learning environments, their potential to enhance or hinder the acquisition of computational skills remains debated. This study investigates the role of generative AI (GenAI) tools, particularly Harvard's CS50 Duck, in supporting programming education. Through a mixed-methods approach, we examine students' perceptions, engagement, and practical application of the CS50 Duck within our Computational Thinking course. Our results indicate that while proficient students use GenAI tools to reinforce problem-solving skills, struggeling students may over-rely on them, potentially bypassing critical learning processes. Survey and assignment data suggest that students value the non-judgmental feedback provided by the CS50 Duck, yet express nuanced views on GenAI's role in formal assessments and programming education. We show that analysing chat histories can serve as a qualitative framework for examining the interactions between students and artificial tutors, while simultaneously offering critical insights into students' learning processes and the challenges they encounter. This study also underscores the need for instructional strategies that guide responsible GenAI use and highlights the importance of educator involvement in integrating these tools effectively.},

  abstract={The utilization of emergent Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAl) within the realm of Internet of Vehicles (loV) can augment edge intelligence, thereby catering to the diverse content-generation needs of novel in-vehicle services. Nonethe-less, existing cloud-centric GAl paradigms are not inherently suitable for wireless vehicular networks, primarily due to their extensive computing requirements, lack of specificity, and spatial detachment from end users. To cope with these challenges, we introduce an innovative Generative 10 V (g 10 V)architecture that employs a collaborative fine-tuning mechanism for pre-trained GAl models. The mechanism is mainly orchestrated collaboratively by Road-Side Units (RSUs) and vehicles within a Federated Learning (FL) paradigm. Here, we take text-to-image diffusion models as typical examples to show the co-fine-tuning workflow in detail, aiming to utilize edge traffic data to realize rapid, customized, and lightweight GAl in the resource-limited 10 V scenario. Thereafter, we formulate the problem of edge communication and computation resource allocation during RSU-vehicle co-fine-tuning, which is pivotal for optimizing time and energy consumption within this process. To address the challenge, we deploy a Self-adaptive Harmony Search (SHS)-based resource allocation strategy. Experiments based on Stable Diffusion vl-4 model validate the excellent performance in image generating and the time and energy consumption during co-fine-tuning in resource-limited and fast-changing 10 V scenarios.},

  abstract={This study discusses the intricate relations between generative artificial intelligence (AI) and music composers. Based on a previous rapid review of recent literature, it reinforces a gap and suggests the need to develop human-centered generative AI design strategies prioritizing cultural artistic (and non-artistic) aspects. We posit that AI-based music generation solutions should resonate with the cultural diversity of stakeholders who are impacted by these systems in practice. The paper highlights the significance of metaphorical design as an effective method in human-AI music co-creation by leveraging familiar interfaces and features that are rooted in everyday objects and cognitive models derived from real-world settings. Our insights illustrate possible ways of (re)framing human-AI metaphorical design to shape perceptions and facilitate seamless interactions between humans and intelligent systems in music co-creativity, particularly at the compositional level. At the heart of this research is the alignment of AI-driven music creation systems with user needs, values, and expectations that vary from culture to culture and thus require a continuous and transparent adaptation of the technology in use to accommodate individual preferences and the socio-algorithmic specificities underlying musicians’ activities.},

  abstract={Facial identification has recently been a legal con-cern for protecting one's identity and personal confidentiality. Many face synthesis techniques were used to safeguard individual users' data. This work presents a technique for generating synthetic faces from in-the-wild face components. The face components, such as the eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth, were extracted from a facial landmark of in-the-wild images and ran-domly replaced with the original image. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for face restoration were then used to denoise the swapped image while preserving the original colorization. The experiments on face swapping with ten thousand of wild images demonstrate an average of 0.723 difference from the source image. The result shows that our face component swapping technique could be an effective lawful way to use facial data in the future.},

  abstract={This study aimed to explore the role of Generative AI (GAI) in enhancing Collaborative Problem-Solving (CPS) capabilities within STEM education. To identify distinct types of learners based on CPS performance and to understand the interactions between learners and AI in the AI-supported projects, the research employed Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) to analyze the cognitive networks of learners. Project-Based Learning (PBL) strategies was utilized to implement the AI-supported STEM collaborative projects and design teaching prompts procedurally in computer-supported collaborative learning environment (CSCL). As a result, the study identified three distinct clusters of learners with varying CPS performance. ENA results indicated varying interaction patterns and qualities among clusters, with implications for the effectiveness of AI as a collaborator in different stages of learning. In conclusion, the study concluded that GAI can significantly support CPS development in STEM projects, particularly when human collaboration is clear and directed. However, the effectiveness of AI is contingent upon the quality of directives provided by learners and the design of collaborative learning prompts. Future research should focus on in-depth study of prompt-design, and broadening the scope of factors considered in GAI-supported learning environments.},

Detecting these faults in DC circuits is challenging due to their subtle electrical signatures and the presence of noise from system and environmental sources. Traditional detection methods often fall short in terms of accuracy, prompting growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions. This review article provides a comprehensive analysis of AI-based techniques for series arc fault detection in PV systems, covering key aspects such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, model optimization, and hardware implementation. It presents a structured comparison of existing methods, including their strengths and limitations, through descriptive discussion and summary tables. The review also includes a simplified flowchart to illustrate the typical AI-based DC arc fault detection process. Key challenges are discussed, along with future directions such as hybrid models, transfer learning, and implementation in resource-constrained edge devices. This work aims to support continued research and development by helping researchers and engineers better understand the strengths and limitations of current approaches and identify practical ways to improve arc fault detection for enhanced PV system safety and reliability.},

  title={FAGR: Feature-Action Generative Replay for Robot Lifelong Imitation Learning}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Conventional imitation learning (IL) struggles with scalability and catastrophic forgetting in sequential task learning, prompting the need for Lifelong Imitation Learning (LIL) to enable sustainable knowledge accumulation. However, existing LIL approaches, which largely depend on replaying demonstration data or generating visual pseudo-samples, suffer from high storage demands and low sample fidelity. To address these issues, we propose Feature-Action Generative Replay (FAGR), a novel LIL framework for robotic manipulation. FAGR begins by performing multimodal feature extraction and feature-action joint clustering for each task to retain cluster statistics, thereby dramatically reducing storage requirements by replacing raw demonstration data with compact cluster statistics. Subsequently, FAGR generates pseudo-feature samples from these statistics and infers corresponding actions via previously learned policy network, thereby obtaining feature-action pairs for past tasks. To enhance the reliability of these samples, FAGR incorporates a filtering mechanism based on action distribution confidence, which selectively retains the high-fidelity generative samples. These curated samples are then integrated with current-task data for joint optimization, enabling effective robust knowledge retention and transfer. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore generative replay in the feature-action space for LIL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAGR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in mitigating forgetting while maintaining high task success rates, thus achieving better stability-plasticity balance.},

Aiming at the problem that the reconstructed image of the enhanced generative adversarial network Esrgan is prone to artifacts, This paper proposes a multi-branch enhanced generative adversarial network model, which adds an attention mechanism module and a residual module to the backbone of the original enhanced generative adversarial network model generator. The attention mechanism module strengthens the learning of useful channel information and suppresses useless channel information through the learning of global channel information. The residual module is a stack of the original Esrgan model block, which is the normalization of the channel dimension and retains the high-frequency features of the image. Experiments show that, compared with the original Esrgan model, the image texture details generated by the improved model are clearer and the resolution is higher, and the PSNR and SSIM of the image are significantly improved.},

  abstract={Automatically designing fast and low-cost digital circuits is challenging because of the discrete nature of circuits and the enormous design space, particularly in the exploration of approximate circuits. However, recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GAI) have shed light to address these challenges. In this work, we present GPTAC, a domain-specific generative pre-trained (GPT) model customized for designing approximate circuits. By specifying the desired circuit accuracy or area, GPTAC can automatically generate an approximate circuit using its generative capabilities. We represent circuits using domain-specific language tokens, refined through a hardware description language keyword filter applied to gate-level code. This representation enables GPTAC to effectively learn approximate circuits from existing datasets by leveraging the GPT language model, as the training data can be directly derived from gate-level code. Additionally, by focusing on a domain-specific language, only a limited set of keywords is maintained, facilitating faster model convergence. To improve the success rate of the generated circuits, we introduce a circuit check rule that masks the GPTAC inference results when necessary. The experiment indicated that GPTAC is capable of producing approximate multipliers in under 15 seconds while utilizing merely 4GB of GPU memory, achieving a 10-40% reduction in area relative to the accuracy multiplier depending on various accuracy needs.},

The history of AI technology started from machine learning, convolution neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), then developed to the latest technology of generative adversarial network (GAN). Deep learning is improving quickly. Data augmentation and transfer learning are currently advanced functions in the field of deep learning, which accelerates the whole training of the neural networks and improves model accuracy. This study implements these two functions and analyzes the performance in a deep learning model. Due to our performance study, researchers can make the most efficient AI model. To find a better deep learning model, we evaluate five deep learning strategies. In this way, we compare different learning effects and observe model accuracy. According to analysis charts and data tables, this study shows that transferred deep learning and fine-tune strategy not only increase the accuracy but also give insignificant overfitting. We also prove that fine-tune transfer learning significantly saves more time and costs in future tests and experiments.},

  abstract={This paper presents an adaptive Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) system which will be able to improve care standards for the elderly by personalizing the health monitoring and interventions. The GenAI system we had developed came to the rescue of the acute needs of the aging population as it was capable of the dynamic learning and adaptation to the user's individual requirements. The architecture of the system has a complex, multi-layered design that combines sensors, data processing units, and user interfaces together, therefore, it provides the care that fits the person and at the same time it will help to reduce the health emergencies. In the real-world, the reduction of the emergency incidents by 40 %, the high level of user satisfaction (85 %) and the decreasing stress level of the caregivers were the main results. The research shows the system's effectiveness in the improvement of the quality of life for the elderly and support of the caregivers by making their daily activities smooth and providing important health information. In the future, we plan to grow the GenAI system, improve its algorithms to achieve even higher levels of accuracy, and broaden the system's applications to other healthcare technologies. The future of elderly care can be changed by the technology of GenAI, so, it is the area where it is needed the most for research and application in healthcare technology.},

  title={A Comparative Study Between a Finetuned Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and the A* Algorithm for BIM Clash Coordination}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={671-676},
  abstract={Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a widely used technology in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry for integrating non-geometrical and geometrical information of physical buildings and assets. However, the current BIM technology poses a challenge when detecting and resolving clashes between models where it requires manual labor, and it is time-consuming. Hence, this project investigates the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) to automate the BIM clash resolution process and benchmark its performance against the $A^{*}$ with dynamic cost function algorithm. To implement GenAI in BIM clash resolution, we fine-tune conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) model using a synthetic image dataset of $\mathbf{2, 0 0 0}$ images. The performance of the cGAN model is compared with a benchmark $A^{*}$ algorithm that is implemented with a dynamic cost function that can set varying cost. A suite of test cases based on real-world BIM scenarios are used to evaluate the performance of the cGAN model and the $A^{*}$ algorithm with dynamic cost. The results demonstrated that the $A^{*}$ algorithm outperforms the cGAN model with 32.91 % similarity to the optimal solution while the cGAN model performs significantly worse than $A^{*}$ algorithm to determine a viable clash-free path, achieving only 4.78 % similarity to the optimal solution, providing unclear and impractical paths within the solution. In contrast, the $A^{*}$ algorithm with dynamic cost function consistently determined a viable clash-free path. Moreover, the $A^{*}$ algorithm achieved the highest similarity of 61.7 % recorded in low obstacle density scenarios at the expense of high computation load.},

  abstract={The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, has introduced various opportunities and challenges that must be addressed for its full potential to be realized in higher education. This study investigates the challenges associated with using GenAI tools in Omani higher education institutions (HEIs) from the perspective of both students and academics. Survey data was collected from 1,749 students and 450 academics across different universities in Oman. The main findings indicate that although both groups recognize issues like logical errors, bias and misleading information, lack of citation accuracy, facilitating cheating, dependency and reduced critical thinking, academics rated challenges slightly higher across all statements, especially on concerns about over-reliance on GenAI and concerns about facilitating cheating in exams or assignments. These findings indicate a significant concern among academics and students about over-reliance on GenAI, which may potentially diminish students’ ability to think critically and creatively, and increase students’ intellectual independence on ChatGPT. Despite these reservations on GenAI use, there is a general positive attitude of both students and academics for the adoption of GenAI in the higher education context, indicating a high level of readiness among both groups to explore GenAI's potential benefits, with an acknowledgment that regulatory frameworks may be necessary to address its potential drawbacks. The study highlights the need for regulatory frameworks, comprehensive guidelines and training programs to foster the responsible and ethical integration of GenAI technologies in Omani HEIs.},

Data science in finance is encountering an increasing need for anonymized data for the same reasons: strict privacy regulations, and need for balanced data for many modeling tasks. In this work, we address three problems in machine learning applications for financial application and offer solutions. First, we successfully generate synthetic data using a set of actual credit loan offer data by training a custom variational autoencoder and a GAN model. Second, we present a comparative analysis of these models using statistical methods. As far as we know, there are no golden standards for the assessment of synthetically generated data for finance applications. Lastly, we introduce a performance comparison method to evaluate synthetically generated data. Our experimental analysis has shown that the proposed methods achieve a satisfactory performance with the generated data in various machine learning models.},

  abstract={Adversarial attack is a method used to deceive machine learning models, which offers a technique to test the robustness of the given model, and it is vital to balance robustness with accuracy. Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers are constantly trying to find a better balance to develop new techniques and approaches to minimize loss of accuracy and increase robustness. To address these gaps, this article proposes a hybrid adversarial attack strategy by utilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method and Projected Gradient Descent effectively to compute the perturbations that deceive deep neural networks, thus quantifying robustness without compromising its accuracy. Three distinct datasets—CelebA, CIFAR-10, and MNIST—were used in the extensive experiment, and six analyses were carried out to assess how well the suggested technique performed against attacks and defense mechanisms. The proposed model yielded confidence values of 99.99% for the MNIST dataset, 99.93% for the CelebA dataset, and 99.99% for the CIFAR-10 dataset. Defense study revealed that the proposed model outperformed previous models with a robust accuracy of 75.33% for the CelebA dataset, 55.4% for the CIFAR-10 dataset, and 98.65% for the MNIST dataset. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the proposed model is better than the other existing methods in computing the adversarial test and improvising the robustness of the system, thereby minimizing the accuracy loss.},

Using balanced datasets, conducting frequent evaluations, and implementing sophisticated models such as transformers that are more cognizant of linguistic context are all essential for increasing accuracy. Using pre-trained language models, fine-tuning on particular tasks, and integrating feedback loops from user interaction enhances the model. Training models on a variety of datasets and cutting down on computational inefficiencies can boost performance and produce faster, more accurate results.

  abstract={The process of maintaining crop to preserve its health naturally is responsible and challenging task in this era of chemical pesticides/insecticides. So, crop management before it is affected by any disease can be a crucial step ahead to avoid the overuse of chemicals. This current work deals with the application of plant disease prediction from thermal images. For this purpose, the popular transfer learning model, EfficientNetB0 utilized for multi-label classification problem. Normal image classification causes more errors than thermal image classification because of blurry images, no clear visuals of the leaves, temperature variations that can't be determined, etc. So EfficientNetB0 model is used which is more balanced, accurate, and efficient. This EfficientNetB0 model combines XAI for a better understanding of the model and gives a higher rate of accuracy than other traditional models. This study highlights the combination of a deep learning model and thermal imaging technique to build a strong, non-invasive mechanism for crop disease management.},

  abstract={Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) refers to bleeding within the brain. Conventional CT examinations performed by radiologists are time-consuming and may lead to ambiguity. The application of artificial intelligence methods for Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection and classification can aid radiologists in accurately identifying the specific subtype of this condition. Traditional feature extraction methods utilising convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often result in redundant feature extraction, failing to account for the interdependencies between image slices and consequently diminishing the overall performance. To address these issues, this study introduced a transformer-based approach for feature extraction and classification. To tackle the data imbalance issues in the dataset, Generative Adversarial Neural Networks(GAN) are used to generate additional images of the minority epidural class.

  abstract={This article presents a new Self-growing and Pruning Generative Adversarial Network (SP-GAN) for realistic image generation. In contrast to traditional GAN models, our SP-GAN is able to dynamically adjust the size and architecture of a network in the training stage by using the proposed self-growing and pruning mechanisms. To be more specific, we first train two seed networks as the generator and discriminator; each contains a small number of convolution kernels. Such small-scale networks are much easier and faster to train than large-capacity networks. Second, in the self-growing step, we replicate the convolution kernels of each seed network to augment the scale of the network, followed by fine-tuning the augmented/expanded network. More importantly, to prevent the excessive growth of each seed network in the self-growing stage, we propose a pruning strategy that reduces the redundancy of an augmented network, yielding the optimal scale of the network. Finally, we design a new adaptive loss function that is treated as a variable loss computational process for the training of the proposed SP-GAN model. By design, the hyperparameters of the loss function can dynamically adapt to different training stages. Experimental results obtained on a set of data sets demonstrate the merits of the proposed method, especially in terms of the stability and efficiency of network training. The source code of the proposed SP-GAN method is publicly available at https://github.com/Lambert-chen/SPGAN.git.},

  abstract={This study aimed to evaluate the performance of three artificial intelligence (AI) image synthesis models, Dall-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, in generating urban design imagery based on scene descriptions. A total of 240 images were generated and evaluated by two independent professional evaluators using an adapted sensibleness and specificity average metric. The results showed significant differences between the three AI models, as well as differing scores across urban scenes, suggesting that some projects and design elements may be more challenging for AI art generators to represent visually. Analysis of individual design elements showed high accuracy in common features like skyscrapers and lawns, but less frequency in depicting unique elements such as sculptures and transit stops. AI-generated urban designs have potential applications in the early stages of exploration when rapid ideation and visual brainstorming are key. Future research could broaden the style range and include more diverse evaluative metrics. The study aims to guide the development of AI models for more nuanced and inclusive urban design applications, enhancing tools for architects and urban planners.},

  abstract={With more and more advanced persistent threats and other advanced attacks emerging, the cybersecurity situation becomes complicated and grim. Owing to its unique advantages, artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in cybersecurity and playing an increasingly important role. However, cybersecurity talents, especially those with AI skills (defined as AISec talents) are in short supply, and talents cultivation becomes a top priority. Cybersecurity competition is one of the most effective ways to identify talents. In order to reduce the gap between supply and demand of AISec talents, we investigate the existing cybersecurity competitions concerning AI applications in the paper. We summarize several existing forms of competing in cybersecurity competitions and discuss the ways AI impacts on cybersecurity. Based on the work of above, AI competitions in categories and how AI is applied in competitions are illustrated in detail. By analyzing and summarizing, we reveal the current problems and point out the direction for future competitions to better serve in talents cultivation and selection.},

  abstract={Biometric authentication has emerged as an important component in strengthening cyber security, providing a superior alternative to conventional password-based systems because of their distinctive and difficult-to-duplicate attributes. This study examines diverse biometric techniques—including fingerprint, facial recognition, palm vein, and behavioral biometrics—and the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to improve their dependability. Innovations including multi-modal biometrics, cancelable biometrics, and Genetic Encryption Algorithms (GEA) are examined, emphasizing their capacity to enhance security while mitigating privacy issues. The research additionally investigates continuous authentication inside IoT systems and future themes such as federated learning and quantum-resistant algorithms. Despite these developments, issues of computing complexity, scalability, consumer acceptance, and data privacy remain.

  abstract={As we know, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is increasingly advanced and developing globally. AI technology has been widely used in many fields, one of which is digital forensics. With the development of AI, there are also many negative impacts such as deepfakes and voice cloning. This research aims to identify several deep learning models adapted for this detection task. The study also seeks to assess the effectiveness of various deep learning approaches in identifying deepfakes and deeper voice cloning, which can be a reliable technique to combat the spread of deepfakes and voice cloning as well. In this research we focus on looking for several models that can detect information manipulation by AI. In this experiment we want to between 2 different datasets for deepfakes and do several iterations to test the datasets. And for voice cloning, we want to test with 2 different methods, namely CNN and LSTM which are carried out in several iterations to get accurate results. The results obtained, for deepfakes, the quality of the image affects the results. For high quality, the highest percentage is 84.87% and low quality is 88.89%. Meanwhile, the voice AI model LSTM shows a higher percentage figure than CNN, namely 99.30%.},

  abstract={The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has accelerated innovations in medical algorithms, yet its broader adoption faces critical ethical and technical barriers. A key challenge lies in algorithmic bias stemming from heterogeneous medical data across institutions, equipment, and workflows, which may perpetuate disparities in AI-driven diagnoses and exacerbate inequities in patient care. While AI's ability to extract deep features from large-scale data offers transformative potential, its effectiveness heavily depends on standardized, high-quality datasets. Current standardization gaps not only limit model generalizability but also raise concerns about reliability and fairness in real-world clinical settings, particularly for marginalized populations. Addressing these urgent issues, this paper proposes an ethical AI framework centered on a novel self-supervised medical image standardization method. By integrating self-supervised image style conversion, channel attention mechanisms, and contrastive learning-based loss functions, our approach enhances structural and style consistency in diverse datasets while preserving patient privacy through decentralized learning paradigms. Experiments across multi-institutional medical image datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves AI generalizability without requiring centralized data sharing. By bridging the data standardization gap, this work advances technical foundations for trustworthy AI in healthcare.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) and digital public infrastructure (DPI) are transforming public governance and service delivery. However, limited research has examined the integration of AI, particularly deep learning, into DPI systems. This study explores how AI-DPI convergence can improve governance efficiency, inclusivity, and scalability. The central research question guiding this paper is: How can deep learning facilitate the integration of AI into DPI to advance public value? The research applies thematic analysis to 60 peer-reviewed publications from 2022–2024, selected for relevance, novelty, and credibility. Key findings identify deep learning as a fusion mechanism enhancing language localization, fraud detection, personalized services, and data fusion within DPI systems. Results show that while such integration holds transformative potential, it also raises ethical, technical, and legacy system challenges. This paper contributes an interdisciplinary analytical framework and policy recommendations, offering actionable insights for future development of intelligent, inclusive digital infrastructures.},

  abstract={This paper examines Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and its impact on cybercrime. RaaS has made sophisticated attacks accessible to a wider range of criminals, increasing the number of ransomware attacks. The paper explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being used by both attackers and defenders in this evolving landscape. AI empowers RaaS attackers by improving target selection, vulnerability identification, and social engineering tactics. It also automates attack processes, making them more efficient. For defenders, AI offers potential in threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response through real-time data analysis. However, challenges like model development complexity, false positives, and the need for explainable AI models exist for both sides. The paper concludes that AI use by both attackers and defenders creates an "AI arms race" in cybersecurity. It further aim(s) to illuminate future cybersecurity strategies and equip defenders with proactive measures against evolving cyber threats.},

  abstract={The prevailing machine vision-based system monitoring faces challenges in complex optical environments, such as insufficient lumination or over-exposed light, which results in a severe reduction in the accuracy of visual surveillance. To fill the gap, this work proposes a novel dual generative adversarial networks model for real-time location-to-image transformation from the sparse distributed positional sensors. The conditional generative adversarial network (cGANis applied to learn high-dimensional features from pre-generated images for enhanced accuracy. The cycleGAN, with improved structure loss and key point loss functions, further improves the generation accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by real monitoring experiments designed to collect a few training data for both sensor data and real images. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the mainstream cGANs variants in terms of overall generation quality and detail edge sharpening.},

  abstract={While the recent boom in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given rise to the technology's use and popularity across many domains, the same boom has exposed vulnerabilities of the technology to many threats that could cause the next "AI winter". AI is no stranger to "winters", or drops in funding and interest in the technology and its applications. Many in the field consider the early 1970's as the first AI winter with another proceeding in the late 1990's and early 2000's. There is some consensus that another AI winter is all but inevitable in some shape or form, however, current thoughts on the next winter do not consider secure and robust AI and the implications of the success or failure of these areas. The emergence of AI as an operational technology introduces potential vulnerabilities to AI's longevity. The National Security Commission on AI (NSCAI) report outlines recommendations for building secure and robust AI, particularly in government and Department of Defense (DoD) applications. However, are they enough to help us fully secure AI systems and prevent the next "AI winter"? An approaching "AI Winter" would have a tremendous impact in DoD systems as well as those of our adversaries. Understanding and analyzing the potential of this event would better prepare us for such an outcome as well as help us understand the tools needed to counter and prevent this "winter" by securing and robustifying our AI systems. In this paper, we introduce the following four pillars of AI assurance, that if implemented, will help us to avoid the next AI winter: security, fairness, trust, and resilience.},
