  abstract={In this paper, we propose a new method combining BERT, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Domain Adaptive technology. DA) natural language processing method - Bidirectional Adaptive Adversarial Network (BAAN). By combining the strengths of the three technologies, BAAN significantly improves the performance and adaptability of natural language processing tasks. Firstly, BERT's powerful language representation capability is used to provide rich semantic information for the model. Secondly, by utilizing the adversarial training mechanism between the generator and discriminator in GAN s, the model can enhance its understanding of data distribution and improve the quality of the text it generates. Finally, domain adaptive technology is introduced to make the model better adapt to the data distribution in different fields and improve the generalization ability of the model. The experimental results show that BAAN performs well in many natural language processing tasks and can capture key information in text more accurately than traditional methods. This fully confirms the effectiveness and practical application of the BAAN architecture in the field of natural language processing, presenting a new technical method for achieving more advanced cross-domain text processing capabilities.},

  abstract={This work is framed in the context of Challenge-Based Learning and describes how mechatronic engineering students tackle a challenge using product design tools and ChatGPT. The challenge was part of the Project Formulation and Evaluation course and involved developing proposals for an automation system in the food industry. The process began by providing students with the client's needs and training them in design tools such as the House of Quality, functional decomposition, the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, and Decision Matrices. Students were then asked to generate proposal solutions for the challenge using both ChatGPT and traditional methods. Preliminary results from this exploratory study indicate that while the design tools initially seemed complex, students found them valuable for addressing future challenges. Integrating these tools with ChatGPT enhanced their problem-solving capabilities, providing a comprehensive approach to tackling real-world problems.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has unexpectedly emerged as a transformative generation, with the functionality to revolutionize numerous business sectors by way of developing new and realistic content material from present records. Unlike traditional AI fashions that cognizance in the main on class and reputation obligations, generative AI excels at producing pics, text, tune, and films, which drives innovation and operational performance across a couple of industries. This examine explores the impact of generative AI, evaluating its packages, overall performance metrics, and emerging traits using a complete dataset from Kaggle that includes numerous statistics kinds such as pics, textual content, track, and video. The research technique includes a radical manner of information collection, rigorous preprocessing, and distinct function extraction and engineering. Data preprocessing is important, related to the removal of replica records, addressing missing values through imputation techniques, and standardizing records codecs to make certain consistency and reliability. Feature extraction focuses on figuring out key attributes associated with generative AI applications and their effect on commercial enterprise performance. Feature engineering extends this through growing and selecting new metrics to seize the nuanced elements of AI improvements. Classification is completed the usage of both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to successfully categorize and examine the effect of generative AI on exclusive commercial enterprise procedures.

  abstract={Continual learning (CL), or the ability to acquire, process, and learn from new information without forgetting acquired knowledge, is a fundamental quality of an intelligent agent. The human brain has evolved into gracefully dealing with ever-changing circumstances and learning from experience with the help of complex neurophysiological mechanisms. Even though artificial intelligence takes after human intelligence, traditional neural networks do not possess the ability to adapt to dynamic environments. When presented with new information, an artificial neural network (ANN) often completely forgets its prior knowledge, a phenomenon called catastrophic forgetting or catastrophic interference. Incorporating CL capabilities into ANNs is an active field of research and is integral to achieving artificial general intelligence. In this review, we revisit CL approaches and critically examine their strengths and limitations. We conclude that CL approaches should look beyond mitigating catastrophic forgetting and strive for systems that can learn, store, recall, and transfer knowledge, much like the human brain. To this end, we highlight the importance of adopting alternative brain-inspired data representations and learning algorithms and provide our perspective on promising new directions where CL could play an instrumental role.},

  abstract={Anomaly detection has wide applications in machine intelligence but is still a difficult unsolved problem. Major challenges include the rarity of labeled anomalies and it is a class highly imbalanced problem. Traditional unsupervised anomaly detectors are suboptimal while supervised models can easily make biased predictions towards normal data. In this paper, we present a new supervised anomaly detector through introducing the novel Ensemble Active Learning Generative Adversarial Network (EAL-GAN). EAL-GAN is a conditional GAN having a unique one generator versus multiple discriminators architecture where anomaly detection is implemented by an auxiliary classifier of the discriminator. In addition to using the conditional GAN to generate class balanced supplementary training data, an innovative ensemble learning loss function ensuring each discriminator makes up for the deficiencies of the others is designed to overcome the class imbalanced problem, and an active learning algorithm is introduced to significantly reduce the cost of labeling real-world data. We present extensive experimental results to demonstrate that the new anomaly detector consistently outperforms a variety of SOTA methods by significant margins.},

  abstract={Over the last couple of years, artificial intelligence has penetrated into every creative aspect of humankind and, in fact, provided unimagined possibilities and, of course, challenges, which traditionally were considered only to be pursued by human ingenuity. This paper examines the evolving relationship between AI technology and contemporary poetry and prose, seeking to understand how these algorithms are, in many ways, helping to shape and inform modes of literary expression. The following section will contextualize this evolution from the Gutenberg Press through to the digital age at this meeting point of technology and literature. Then, it continues with the emergence of AI as a tool for creative design, where it refers to the possibility of handling large data to offer information, generate textual content, even mimicking humanlike patterns of languages, through methods such as natural language processing (NLP) or machine learning. Further, the paper reflects the ethical and philosophical impact of AI literature on such questions as authorship, authenticity, and the nature of creativity. With reference to case studies and examples of AI-authored poetry and prose, this paper attempts to find some kind of line that might be drawn between so many different approaches by writers, scholars, and technologists who all vie to use AI as their muse. It also views the chance for the author to collude with AI and human writers and play their role in the capacity of “co-creators” or “sources of inspiration” in the literary process.},

  pages={630-634},
  abstract={Zero-shot learning (ZSL) utilizes semantic information that is auxiliary information to transfer knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes, thereby realizing the recognition of unseen classes. The generative methods train the model to generate pseudo image features for the unseen classes, thus transforming ZSL into a supervised learning problem. However, the classification performances of these methods still suffer from weak generalization. To address this issue, the paper proposes a novel Generative Adversarial Network based on Generative Feature Constraint (GFCGAN). First, based on the LsrGAN [1], a semantic constraint module is added to restrict the generated image features by keeping the semantic information consistent. Then, in the case of keeping the semantic relationships between classes consistent, the generated image features of unseen classes are farther away from the feature prototypes of their most similar classes in both semantic and feature space so as to train the generative model and generate high-quality pseudo image features. Finally, the trained classifier is used to classify images of unseen classes. Experiments on standard datasets verify the effectiveness of our model and achieve good results.},

  abstract={In smart communities, social media allowed users easy access to multimedia content. With recent advancements in computer vision and natural language processing, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models have evolved. With advancements in generative adversarial networks (GAN), it has become possible to create fake images/audio/and video streams of a person or use some person’s audio and visual details to fit other environments. Thus, deepfakes are specifically used to disseminate fake information and propaganda on social circles that tarnish the reputation of an individual or an organization. Recently, many surveys have focused on generating and detecting deepfake images, audio, and video streams. Existing surveys are mostly aligned toward detecting deepfake contents, but the generation process is not suitably discussed. To address the survey gap, the paper proposes a comprehensive review of deepfake generation and detection and the different ML/DL approaches to synthesize deepfake contents. We discuss a comparative analysis of deepfake models and public datasets present for deepfake detection purposes. We discuss the implementation challenges and future research directions regarding optimized approaches and models. A unique case study, IBMM is discussed, which presents a multi-modal overview of deepfake detection. The proposed survey would benefit researchers, industry, and academia to study deepfake generation and subsequent detection schemes.},

  abstract={Recently, generative AI has attracted much attention from both academic and industrial fields, due to its potential especially in data generation and synthesis aspects. Simultaneously, secure and privacy-preserving mobile crowdsensing (SPPMCS) has been widely applied in data collection/acquisition due to advantages of low deployment cost, flexible implementation, and high adaptability. Since generative AI can generate new synthetic data to replace the original data to be analyzed and processed, it can lower data attacks and privacy leakage risks for the original data. Therefore, integrating generative AI into SPPMCS is feasible and significant. Moreover, this article investigates an integration of generative AI in SPPMCS, where we present potential research focuses, solutions, and case studies. Specifically, we firstly review the preliminaries for generative AI and SPPMCS, where their integration potential is presented. Then, we discuss research issues and solutions for generative AI-enabled SPPMCS, including security defense against malicious data injection, illegal authorization, malicious spectrum manipulation at the physical layer, as well as privacy protection for data content and terminals' identification and location. Next, we propose a framework for sensing data content protection with generative AI. Simulation results have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework. Finally, we present major research directions for generative AI-enabled SPPMCS.},

This study proposes three designer-AI collaboration modes with typical operable processes during sketching. We conducted a user experiment to compare the effects of different collaboration modes on the quantity, novelty, variety of design outcomes, and the designer’s experience. The results show that the collaboration modes can significantly affect the sketch’s quantity and variety, as well as the designer’s overall satisfaction.

  abstract={The emergence of generative AI (GAI) has significantly impacted education, offering both opportunities and challenges for the sector’ s digital transformation. As the use of GAI in learning grows increasingly prevalent among students, its adoption varies greatly from one individual to another. Despite this growing trend, research on students' use and perceptions of GAI remains relatively scarce. In our study, we employed a mixed-methods, multiple-case study design to explore the impact of GAI on students across four grades. We focused on six key areas: learning interest, independent learning, problem-solving, confidence, appropriate use, and learning enjoyment. Our results revealed that participants had optimistic expectations regarding the utilisation of GAI to facilitate their learning. They believed that GAI could contribute positively to all six dimensions, enhancing their educational experience. We found that college students exhibited a higher level of performance than high school students across all six aspects. The insights we gained from this study can inform future research in digital education, particularly in understanding the diverse ways in which students interact with and perceive GAI. By recognizing the potential of GAI in transforming education, educators and policymakers can better harness its capabilities to enhance teaching and learning experiences. Additionally, the findings can guide the development of GAI-based educational tools and resources that cater to the needs of students across different grade levels.},

  title={Stochastic Reconstruction Of Microstructures Based on Generative Adversarial Network Via Explainable AI System}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1027-1031},
  abstract={Random media are materials with irregular structure and spatial randomness, whose macroscopic properties are usually determined by their internal microstructure. Traditional methods for medium reconstruction are usually based on numerical simulation, but the reconstruction process is not only complicated, but also the achieved reconstruction effect is not good. In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning, generative models (e.g., Generative Adversarial Networks) have been widely used in reconstructing the microstructure of random media. However, early GANs not only cannot effectively notice the features of the input data, but also the computational and parameter storage costs can be huge during the training process. Therefore, how to compress the training cost without sacrificing the training effect turns out to be an urgent problem. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D stochastic medium reconstruction method (3DESGAN) incorporating an explainable system. 3DESGAN introduces an explainable system into the GANs, which provides "richer" correction feedback from the discriminator to the generator. The results show that the addition of an explainable system can effectively improve the quality of the generated images. In addition, in order to control the stochastic nature of the GANs reconstruction process and enable the user to control the pore distribution characteristics of the microstructure, we adopt a style-based GAN (StyleGAN) approach, which incorporates the porosity in the form of style vectors as conditional data in the training process. Meanwhile, we utilize the attention mechanism of Transformer to enhance the ability of 3DESGAN to extract features from multi-scale training images. By comparing 3DESGAN with traditional numerical generation methods, we demonstrate its advantages in terms of reconstruction quality and efficiency.},

  abstract={AI has powerful capabilities in prediction, automation, planning, targeting, and personalisation. Generally, it is assumed that AI can enable machines to exhibit human-like intelligence, and is claimed to benefit to different areas of our lives. Since AI is fueled by data and is a distinct form of autonomous and self-learning agency, we are seeing increasing ethical concerns related to AI uses. In order to mitigate various ethical concerns, national and international organisations including governmental organisations, private sectors as well as research institutes have made extensive efforts by drafting ethical principles of AI, and having active discussions on ethics of AI within and beyond the AI community. This paper investigates these efforts with a focus on the identification of fundamental ethical principles of AI and their implementations. The review found that there is a convergence around limited principles and the most prevalent principles are transparency, justice and fairness, responsibility, non-maleficence, and privacy. The investigation suggests that ethical principles need to be combined with every stages of the AI lifecycle in the implementation to ensure that the AI system is designed, implemented and deployed in an ethical manner. Similar to ethical framework used in biomedical and clinical research, this paper suggests checklist-style questionnaires as benchmarks for the implementation of ethical principles of AI.},

  year={2024},
  volume={62},
  number={},
  pages={1-16},
  abstract={Precipitation forecasting, encompassing high-resolution regional and accurate intensity forecasting, has long been a central focus in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. Generally, AI models forecast future radar precipitation sequences from historical radar precipitation sequences. However, current precipitation forecasting suffers from three issues: 1) mismatched precipitation patterns, for example, motion speed; 2) blurred precipitation field generation; and 3) inaccurate intensity forecasts. It is owing that AI models: 1) tend to simulate the average motion states and overlook individual motion (defined as the description of the motion speed, trajectory, and direction for a single precipitation sample), leading to either overestimation or underestimation of the motion speed for a specific precipitation field and 2) are inclined to filter out high-frequency components to reduce noise in the information transmission, resulting in low resolution and blurred precipitation fields. The modeling challenges impose constraints on achieving high-resolution regional and accurate intensity forecasting. Here, to the former, we propose an individual motion-driven AI (IMD-AI) method, incorporating motion matching, alignment, and refinement through constructed pattern groups. It effectively solves the mismatch in motion estimation for an individual precipitation field, ensuring global and intact regional precipitation forecasting. To the latter, we put forward a schedule sampling, patch embedding, and adversarial strategies (SPA) training mechanism, which eliminates sharp and local information loss issues during the filtering of high-frequency components. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IMD-AI achieves accurate motion estimation of individual precipitation fields and generates high-resolution regional and accurate intensity forecasting.},

  abstract={While the benefits of 6G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) are numerous, providing high-speed, low-latency communication that brings new opportunities for innovation and forms the foundation for continued growth in the IoT industry, it is also important to consider the security challenges and risks associated with the technology. In this paper, we propose a two-stage intrusion detection framework for securing IoTs, which is based on two detectors. In the first stage, we propose an adversarial training approach using generative adversarial networks (GAN) to help the first detector train on robust features by supplying it with adversarial examples as validation sets. Consequently, the classifier would perform very well against adversarial attacks. Then, we propose a deep learning (DL) model for the second detector to identify intrusions. We evaluated the proposed approach's efficiency in terms of detection accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks. Experiment results with a new cyber security dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in detecting both intrusions and persistent adversarial examples with a weighted avg of 96%, 95%, 95 %, and 95% for precision, recall, f-score, and accuracy, respectively.},

  title={Improving AI-Based Skin Disease Classification with StyleGAN3 for Minority Skin Tone Generation}, 
  year={2024},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Skin diseases are prevalent in Thailand due to the hot temperatures, humid climate, and increasing diversity of skin tones, which complicates diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) has improved skin disease detection through deep learning models, aiding faster diagnoses and reducing the workload on dermatologists. However, AI models often struggle with underrepresentation of darker skin tones in training datasets, affecting performance. To address this imbalance, data augmentation techniques like generative models are recommended. This research enhances skin disease classification using StyleGAN3 for data augmentation to balance minority skin tone classes. The Fitzpatrick17k dataset focusing on Acne, Psoriasis, and Vitiligo is used. The Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale is reduced from six to three levels due to image availability. VGG16 is applied to classify skin tone classes. Two additional datasets, the original and traditionally augmented datasets, are used for comparison against the StyleGAN3-augmented dataset. Results show that the StyleGAN3-augmented dataset achieves the best performance with F1-scores of 0.7193, 0.7446, and 0.7543 and accuracy scores of 0.7200, 0.7368, and 0.7419 for Acne, Psoriasis, and Vitiligo respectively. The obtained results demonstrate that utilizing the StyleGAN3-augmented dataset for skin disease classification in minority skin tone classes yields the highest performance, with F1-scores increasing by 19.25%, 19.77%, and 25.94 % for Acne, Psoriasis, and Vitiligo, respectively. These findings highlight the effectiveness of StyleGAN3 in improving model performance for underrepresented skin tones in skin disease classification.},

  abstract={In the context of burgeoning cyber threats targeting Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, this paper presents a pioneering Intrusion Detection System (IDS) grounded in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The ubiquity of information technology in critical industrial processes necessitates heightened security measures, and the proposed model addresses this imperative through the fusion of GANs and IDS tailored for SCADA environments. The study delves into the evolutionary trajectory of Intrusion Detection Systems, tracing their progression from conventional signature-based methods to the adaptive capabilities afforded by artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning. Against this backdrop, the paper investigates the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems, elucidating the sophisticated attack vectors identified in recent studies. The distributed nature of SCADA systems, deployed across extensive industrial landscapes, accentuates the need for robust intrusion detection mechanisms. This research's core innovation lies in applying a GAN model to SCADA systems, leveraging the distributed network protocol version 3 (DNP3) for data access authorization. The model is trained on a dataset comprising 12 meticulously selected features from DNP3 packets, attuning it to the nuances of SCADA network traffic. Notably, the proposed GAN-based IDS demonstrates exceptional efficacy, achieving impressive accuracy. Beyond the empirical contributions, the paper envisions future directions for integrating explainable AI techniques and enhancing the interpretability of IDS models specific to SCADA environments. Moreover, collaboration between academia and industry is advocated to foster the development of comprehensive datasets that represent SCADA network traffic.},

  abstract={Music exerts an essential role in human beings' daily life. However, there are many restrictions in the field of traditional music creation. In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence accelerated significantly, how to apply deep learning to music creation is an intriguing topic, and it is worth a wide range of exploration and discussions. In the paper, a deep learning model composed of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was introduced to implement the generation of music. The GANs are mainly composed of a generator and a discriminator, while LSTM serves as the basic unit of the generator and discriminator. Through analyzing the music file generated in different iteration times, the results demonstrate that the pieces of music we got via the model made up of GAN and LSTM are in a similar pattern.},

  year={2024},
  volume={16},
  number={4},
  pages={1223-1232},
  abstract={Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets have important implications for the study of degenerative diseases because such datasets have data from multiple points in time to track disease progression. However, longitudinal datasets are often incomplete due to unexpected quits of patients. In previous work, we proposed an augmentation method temporal recurrent generative adversarial network (TR-GAN) that can complement missing session data of MRI datasets. TR-GAN uses a simple U-Net as a generator, which limits its performance. Transformers have had great success in the research of computer vision and this article attempts to introduce it into longitudinal dataset completion tasks. The multihead attention mechanism in transformer has huge memory requirements, and it is difficult to train 3-D MRI data on graphics processing units (GPUs) with small memory. To build a memory-friendly transformer-based generator, we introduce a Hilbert transform module (HTM) to convert 3-D data to 2-D data that preserves locality fairly well. To make up for the insufficiency of convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models that are difficult to establish long-range dependencies, we propose an Swin transformer-based up/down sampling module (STU/STD) module that combines the Swin transformer module and CNN module to capture global and local information simultaneously. Extensive experiments show that our model can reduce mean squared error (MMSE) by at least 7.16% compared to the previous state-of-the-art method.},

  abstract={OpenAI created and published ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, in November 2022. It was developed using supervised and reinforcement learning methods and is based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT -4 families of big language models. The creation of Artificial Intelligence has started a new era in the field of computer science. Although it was first established in 1950, by, now known as the father of artificial intelligence, John McCarthy, and before that by Alan Turning who explored its mathematical possibilities, Technology is generally ranked using a sigmoid curve, wherein you have a slow take off as the technology is invented, followed by an explosion of growth depending on how useful it is. That results in improvement in the technology as people find more real world practical applications for it, and then it reaches a stagnation point where you can't improvise the tech anymore. We believe that Artificial Intelligence would be the start of a new sigmoid curve. Artificial Intelligence has now reached a new peak after the maturation of ChatGPT. Currently, AI has a gradual growth rate of 21 % per annum, creating a new market in this highly competitive industry. This paper represented the ChatGPT features, paradigm and data analysis process.},

  year={2025},

  abstract={As one of the most common neurological disorders, epilepsy poses major challenges in clinical practice. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), which is highly prevalent among drug-resistant cases, often fails to respond to anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), making surgical intervention a necessary treatment option. Consequently, accurate identification of the epileptogenic zone is essential to optimize surgical outcomes. MRI is the most widely used non-invasive imaging technique for epileptogenic focus localization, offering superior soft-tissue contrast and diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, the utility of MRI can be restricted due to time limitations, high costs, or certain patient-specific contraindications. Recently, the deep learning breakthroughs have made the synthesis of MRI images from CT scans possible. However, the patients undergoing both CT and MRI scans are limited, making it difficult to obtain large-scale paired datasets. In this study, we have proposed an RSPGAN method which is based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). This method has integrated image registration and temporal lobe segmentation. In the result, the images generated by the RSPGAN method achieve an SSIM of $0.97 \pm 0.02$ and a PSNR of $30.36 \pm 4.74$, with significantly reduced error metrics: MAE of $4.93 \pm 2.82$ and MSE of $79.10 \pm 43.49$, outperforming the other models. The experimental results demonstrate that our RSPGAN method achieves superior performance on limited datasets.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been utilized in the education industry for enhancing student’s performance by generating spontaneous, timely, and personalized query response. One such technology is a dialogue system which is capable of generating humorous and empathetic responses for enhancing students’ learning outcomes. There is, however, limited research on the combination of humor, empathy, and culture in education. Thus, this paper proposes a dialogue system that is based on Wasserstein’s Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) for generating responses with humor, empathy, and cultural sensitivity. The dialogue system has the ability to generate responses that take into account both coarse-grained emotions at the conversation level and fine-grained emotions at the token level, allowing for a nuanced understanding of a student’s emotional state. It can utilize external knowledge and prior context to enhance the ability of AI dialogue systems to comprehend emotions in a multimodal context. It can also analyze large corpora of text and other data, providing valuable insights into cultural context, semantic properties, and language variations. The dialogue system is a promising AI technology that can improve learning outcomes in various academic fields by generating responses with humor, empathy, and cultural sensitivity. In our study, the dialogue system achieved an accuracy rate of 94.12%, 93.83% and 92.60% in humor, empathy and culture models, respectively.},

However, this advancement comes with its share of challenges, such as misuse, prompting discussions on effective response strategies. Consequently, recommendations and regulations, including the adoption of watermark technology, are under deliberation on a country-by-country basis. Many companies are also integrating watermark technology into their services as a means of addressing this issue. This paper presents an analysis of the current status of watermark adoption across various countries and companies. Furthermore, it delves into further research topics that should be taken into account when implementing watermark technology.

  abstract={With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, particularly the rise of deep learning, the importance of Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become increasingly prominent. Among its key techniques, counterfactual explanation plays a crucial role in understanding the decision-making mechanisms of opaque models. However, the high dimensionality and complex feature patterns of image data pose significant challenges for the task of generating counterfactuals for images. Existing literature has proposed various algorithms based on different assumptions, many of which rely on the existence of appropriate generative models. Some of these assumptions, particularly the assumption regarding the existence of generative models, may be overly stringent. To address this issue, this letter introduces a novel assumption-free image counterfactual generation algorithm, DFO-S, based on Score Matching and gradient-free optimization techniques. The proposed method achieves high-quality counterfactual generation without relying on generative models. Through extensive empirical analysis, we demonstrate the significant superiority of our method in terms of performance.},

  abstract={This study examines the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in enhancing personalization, analyzing information dynamics, and developing scalable methodologies within Online Social Networks and Media (OSNEM), with a focus on user protection. Through a systematic review using the PRISMA framework and BERTopic modeling, key AI applications in OSNEM were identified, including fake news detection, sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, big data analysis, bot detection, and insights into public health, disaster relief, and mental health. Although AI techniques and multimodal frameworks have significantly improved content personalization, challenges like algorithmic bias and echo chambers remain. To address these, the implementation of fairness-aware learning models is recommended to ensure personalization stays ethical. Advanced AI techniques, such as Dynamic Memory Networks and Temporal Convolutional Networks, have shown strong capabilities in tracking opinion dynamics and combating misinformation. Additionally, Generative AI offers opportunities for content creation but also raises concerns about misinformation, requiring robust moderation frameworks. Emerging technologies like Artificial Real Intelligence (ARI), which simulate human reasoning and decision-making, could further improve the management of complex online interactions. The study highlights the need for scalable AI methodologies, such as multitask learning frameworks, to efficiently handle the vast amounts of real-time data generated by social media while addressing cross-platform adaptability and computational efficiency.},

  abstract={Understanding facial expressions is important for the interactions among humans as it conveys a lot about the person's identity and emotions. Research in human emotion recognition has become more popular nowadays due to the advances in the machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, the spread of COVID-19, and the need for wearing masks in the public has impacted the current emotion recognition models' performance. Therefore, improving the performance of these models requires datasets with masked faces. In this paper, we propose a model to generate realistic face masks using generative adversarial network models, in particular image inpainting. The MAFA dataset was used to train the generative image inpainting model. In addition, a face detection model was proposed to identify the mask area. The model was evaluated using the MAFA and CelebA datasets, and promising results were obtained.},

The following new five points summarize the opportunities and challenges ahead as we move toward an understanding of architecture in solidarity with both human and nonhuman beings. It includes: the challenge of bias, the cultivation of sensibility, the crisis of labor, the freedom of incoherence and the redefinition of authorship. The discipline of architecture has developed an unhealthy relationship with the labor necessary to produce good designs. After 30 years of digital tools in architecture, generative artificial intelligence tools are one of the only tools that help to expand the design imagination by focusing on the early design phases. However, most design tools prioritize accuracy and certainty, and as a result, they require designers to create workflows that quickly organize and structure their ideas, potentially prematurely.</p>},

  abstract={Although it is known that the COVID-19 process is over, the subsequent damage caused by COVID-19 on the body is undeniable. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown to be responsible for causing acute respiratory distress in a large number of COVID-19 cases. When the literature is reviewed, Thorax Computed Tomography is recommended to evaluate permanent lung damage in individuals recovering from COVID-19. When tomography images are examined, the respiratory systems of patients who have had COVID-19 are significantly affected by the virus. In the study, thorax CT images of patients who had COVID-19 and then came back to the hospital and were diagnosed with COPD and Bronchiectasis were examined with artificial intelligence methods. The study consists of two stages. First, COVID-19, COPD, and Bronchiectasis datasets were trained with pre-trained deep-learning models. Then, only the COVID-19 dataset was trained with the GAN algorithm, and the model weights were recorded. Tests were performed on the COPD and Bronchiectasis dataset with the recorded model weight. The performance metric ratios of the training results obtained with the COVID-19 dataset and test trained individually and the combination of three classes was compared in the test environment. As a result of the proposed study, the highest performance rate for the classification method made in the first step was found to be 99% in the pre-trained DenseNet201 model. In the second step of the study, model weights were recorded on the COVID-19 dataset trained with the GAN algorithm and tested on COPD and Bronchiectasis datasets. Lower loss rates are observed in the GAN algorithm compared to the models in the first stage of the study.},

  abstract={With the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and Large Language Models (LLM), new flavour of teaching by replacing the humans has emerged in the recent educational scenarios. However, low-resource contents in cross- languages and high complex training are considered to be major bottleneck for an effective implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based teaching agents for fulfilling the language barriers. In this context, this research article aims to develop the hybrid generative AI framework that utilizes finetuned language model by the meta-heuristic technique to achieve the high translation accuracy. The suggested hybrid framework incorporates the fine-tuned Mistral-7B model integrated with the meta-heuristic algorithm for a achieving the high rate of translated contents in accordance to the student's known language. The comprehensive experimentation is carried out using the different multi-lingual datasets and various metrics such as BLEU, ChF and WER are analysed and validated with the other language models such as LLAMA, GEMMA, GPT.3.0 and BERT. The complete data -driven outcomes demonstrated that the proposed meta-heuristic model has achieved BLEU score of 0.9, chF score of 0.99 and WER with 0.01, which outshines the other models in producing the enhanced reliability of produced contents. These findings highlights the potential of hybrid large language models for generating the more reliable contents, offering the more scalable system for breaking the language barrier},

  abstract={This article discusses the Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) project’s complex ecology and how to pick the optimal models and data design. Creative AI in many commercial and academic fields presents new issues and opportunities. Knowing your way around generative AI projects is crucial. Choose models carefully since data design is hard to grasp. This research provides comprehensive guidance on how to address these areas and ensure project success. Data architecture study is the first step towards generative artificial intelligence since it identifies common issues and viable solutions. Next, to determine which generative models—in terms of complexity, scalability, and ethics—are best suited for a range of tasks, we must evaluate and compare many of them. Researchers were able to validate these findings using case studies and expert interviews. The results suggest that an ordered data infrastructure is required for creative AI. This study indicated the need to boost generational artificial intelligence programs by making practitioners and researchers more aware of the challenges. The study argues that further research and development are necessary to keep up with the fast progress of creative artificial intelligence.},

A number of businesses created tools and frameworks to enable developers to create creative applications using these LLMs like OpenAI recently lead the big language model wave. In a similar vein, we sought to create a program called ‘Question and Answer model using Generative AI and LangChain Framework’. A number of LLMs on the market can be integrated with LangChain, as well as other data sources. With the use of large language models (LLMs), developers can now create apps that they were before unable to. To build a genuinely effective app, leveraging these LLMs alone is frequently insufficient; you must mix them with additional sources of computation or knowledge. Artificial intelligence that can produce text, graphics, or other stuff that resembles what a person would produce is known as "generative AI". It analyses data patterns using deep learning techniques, such as neural networks, and then creates new content based on those patterns. Text generating, visual synthesis, and even music composition are some of the uses for generative AI.},

Data augmentation can address such problem by creating data for the minority class to rebalance the datasets. However, it is still challenging that how to generate data from a true distribution of given finite training data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient synthetic oversampling approach, Generator Information Enhancement Generative Adversarial Networks (GIE-GAN). Its generative information is enhanced in two aspects. First, the generator can get common knowledge of all classes by initializing with a variational autoencoder. Second, during the training process, an independent classifier, which can provide accurate classification results for the generator, is added to the GAN for further augmenting the generative information. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that, compared with the rival methods, our method can generate high-quality images and obtain better classifier performance of deep learning, especially for high imbalance ratios.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been applied in many fields. However, the existing GANs and their variants encounter many problems, including pattern collapse, training instability and falling into local optimal. Therefore, we construct a lightweight evolutionary generative adversarial network (LGEGAN) with statistic global information. To solve the problem that shallow convolutional neural networks are difficult to capture long-range feature dependence and the training process is prone to pattern collapse, LGEGAN is different from EGAN in that we add an improved self-attention mechanism to the generator network. To solve the problem of instability in the training process, we add spectral normalization to LGEGAN, which increases the stability of each generation of training process. Finally, to efficiently evolve individuals who adapt to the environment in a short time and solve the problem of falling into local optimal, different from EGAN, we construct a novel selection operator and apply it to the selection stage of LGEGAN's evolution of the generator. In the experiments, we evaluate the LGEGAN from four aspects: the quality and diversity of generated images, the collapse of patterns, the stability of training and the robustness of the architecture. The experimental results indicate that the performance of LGEGAN is better than that of EGAN, MOEGAN, SMOEGAN, LRGAN, ProbGAN and the other generative adversarial network models.},

However, very limited research has focused on developing AI or ML-based solutions for autistic individuals largely due to the scarcity of autism-related datasets. In order for autistic people to equally benefit from the breakthroughs in AI, the data representation gap in AI and ML must be addressed. The project proposes an innovative human expert and AI combined approach to generate synthetic data about autistic individuals. Through this approach, we are developing the first dataset of case studies of autistic individuals to effectively identify evidence-based practices (EBPs) to address the unique needs of autistic individuals. The project improves the representation and inclusion of autistic individuals in the rapidly evolving field of ML and AI through both methodological innovations (i.e., the expert/AI combined data generation approach) and practical contributions (i.e., the EBP dataset that will be made publicly accessible). The innovative data generation method and supporting materials developed in this project can be generalized to individuals with other disabilities.},

  abstract={AI (Artificial Intelligence) technologies are a broad category of computer science techniques that enable machines to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing images, making decisions, and solving problems. Chatbots are a specific type of AI technology that is designed to communicate with humans in a natural, conversational way using text or voice input. Chatbots are often used in customer service and support to provide quick and convenient assistance to users. GBT (Gradient Boosting Trees) is an ensemble learning method that uses a set of decision trees to make predictions. It is a popular method for a variety of machine-learning tasks, including classification and regression. GBT is often used in combination with other AI technologies to improve the accuracy of predictions and decision-making. In this paper, we are focusing on the chat gbt and Dalle-2.

  abstract={The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning presents both utility and security implications for our digital interactions. This study focuses on the transformative role of generative AI in social engineering attacks, specifically examining three pillars where it significantly amplifies their impact: advanced targeting and personification, genuine content creation, and automated attack infrastructure. The analysis forms a conceptual model named the generative AI social engineering framework. The research delves into human implications and measures to counter social engineering attacks, blending theoretical analysis with practical insights through case studies. Ethical considerations surrounding AI in malicious activities are discussed, emphasizing the importance of safe AI development, and various articles were reviewed to highlight social engineering attacks as a common threat. Two studies were conducted: a user testing study with 48 participants from diverse occupations and social engineering awareness, and an exploratory study collecting qualitative data from 40 social engineering attack victims. The user testing study revealed universal acceptance of the AI-based tool, irrespective of participants’ occupations. Victim themes included reasons for falling prey to attacks, methods, prevention advice, and detection. The research concludes by highlighting AI-generated content as a key factor fueling social engineering attacks and bridging the gap between AI development and cybersecurity practices, highlighting the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address evolving challenges.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={With the rising rate of stress-induced mental disorders, it is clearly apparent that there is an urgent need for highly precise and efficient stress recognition models. This research addresses the limitations of existing stress recognition models by suggesting an innovative ensemble approach, which tries to not only increase recognition capabilities but also allow a thorough understanding of the basic mechanisms. The main goal of this research was to create and evaluate a novel ensemble model for stress recognition, while using the complementary strengths of both generative and discriminative learning. To accomplish this, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) model with a Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) network are integrated. Dataset augmentation and better feature representation were handled by CGAN, while temporal dependencies found in physiological signals’ attributes were captured by using the CNN-LSTM. The ensemble model was K-fold cross-validated for proving its robustness and generalization. Also, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP values) is used to enhance model interpretability by informing the user about the importance of the features considered by the model and the reasons behind the decisions made. The results showed a drastic improvement in the accuracy for stress recognition when compared with other state-of-the-art existing methods. The ensemble model had proven its accuracy, precision, and recall to be very high, thereby distinguishing among different classes for stress recognition successfully. The comparative analysis proved that this proposed ensemble model outperforms existing models with better accuracy and robustness; thus, it comes forward to revolutionize this field of stress recognition. Future work will involve modeling the performance along real-life scenarios and implementing it on wearable devices for stress monitoring.},

  abstract={Within the domain of robotics, effective interaction between a human collaborator and robot is a topic of great importance. With the continued advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), we propose a prototype system that utilizes GAI and seeks to bridge the gap between the human and robot. This prototype utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) combined with a vision system for detection and tracking, to allow the GAI system to control a robotic arm and manipulate objects within the action space. We model the action space within our experiments on the 3-cup Monte game where the user can prompt the system to manipulate the cups within the action space based on the ball’s location. Experimentation is done on prompts of varying lengths of sequences, and we evaluate our system based on its ability to understand the prompt and correctly execute the desired task. With this collaboration of techniques and technologies, we hope to open the possibilities and extend human and robotic collaboration into new areas. The results of our experiments show promising results to this end.},

  number={8},
  pages={1925-1937},
  abstract={Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been proven to be an efficient way to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent dramatic progress on deep learning greatly promotes the MRI analysis based on data-driven CNN methods using a large-scale longitudinal MRI dataset. However, most of the existing MRI datasets are fragmented due to unexpected quits of volunteers. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Temporal Recurrent Generative Adversarial Network (TR-GAN) to complete missing sessions of MRI datasets. Unlike existing GAN-based methods, which either fail to generate future sessions or only generate fixed-length sessions, TR-GAN takes all past sessions to recurrently and smoothly generate future ones with variant length. Specifically, TR-GAN adopts recurrent connection to deal with variant input sequence length and flexibly generate future variant sessions. Besides, we also design a multiple scale & location (MSL) module and a SWAP module to encourage the model to better focus on detailed information, which helps to generate high-quality MRI data. Compared with other popular GAN architectures, TR-GAN achieved the best performance in all evaluation metrics of two datasets. After expanding the Whole MRI dataset, the balanced accuracy of AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) vs. mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and stable MCI vs. progressive MCI classification can be increased by 3.61% and 4.00%, respectively.},

  abstract={CycleGAN, a type of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), is used in this study to tackle the difficult problem of translating cityscape photographs between day and night settings. Day-to-night picture translation is changing well-lit daytime images into nocturnal landscapes using artificial lighting, unique color palettes, and atmospheric effects, and vice versa. Previously, this work required labour-intensive manual involvement or specialised picture algorithms, but deep learning and GANs have introduced automation and better quality to this industry. CycleGAN excels at unpaired picture translation, even when there are no obvious correspondences between daylight and nighttime datasets. It makes use of the idea of cycle consistency to ensure proper translation between picture domains. This study focuses on training a CycleGAN model and found encouraging results. Beyond technical aspects, this paper highlights practical applications spanning film production, gaming, urban planning, traffic management, photography, environmental impact assessment, and more. CycleGAN's adaptability offers opportunities to enhance realism, aesthetics, and decision-making across various domains. In summary, this research underscores the potential of CycleGAN in day-to-night image translation, unlocking new possibilities in visualizing urban environments and influencing diverse industries and applications.},

  abstract={Rapid malware evolution calls for the creation of novel, imaginative techniques that enhance the accuracy and resilience of traditional detection methods. Here, a hybrid strategy focused on malware detection will be proposed, where GANs and transfer learning are employed to improve the accuracy and resilience of image representations. Converting malware binaries into grayscale images may change how visual features are used to identify specific patterns that could define malware and eventually determine classification. GANs are used to generate artificial malware samples, which enhance the dataset with a variety of adversarial examples that closely mimic the diversity of actual malware. The model is therefore more resistant to deceptive infection techniques. Convolutional neural network pre-training enables transfer learning and saves resources for lengthy training from scratch and decreases the strain of training. As was previously said, the GAN-generative adversarial examples feature a wider variety of malware types that enhance its capacity to identify new threats precisely. Opposing the traditional approach, the experimental findings showed that this hybrid strategy improved the detection accuracy and decreased the rate of false positives. The reason for this is its adaptability and scalability, which qualify it for real-time malware detection.},

  abstract={This paper presents an innovative approach for evaluating and improving the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial attacks for image datasets. In this framework, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are proposed for synthetic image generation, and Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs) are used for noise removal. An adversarial training pipeline is used to generate adversarial examples and analyze the effect of these examples on model performance. A discriminator network is used for adversarial sample detection and classifying samples, whereas the autoencoder is used to minimize reconstruction errors by means of a robust image recovering algorithm. The evaluation contains metrics for an adversarial sample detection and reconstruction accuracy, thereby providing insight into the robustness or sometimes defense of ML models under adversarial conditions. The results indicate that this is able to detect adversarial influences on the models and mitigate them evidently, thus forming one step towards forming secure AI systems.},

  abstract={In the rapidly evolving domain of cloud computing and cybersecurity, staying ahead of threats requires proactive and adaptive solutions. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework designed to enhance cloud security through automated attack generation, execution, and defense enhancement. The framework consists of four main components: the Database, the Generator, the Executor, and the Defender. The database comprises extensive data sources, including attack logs and security reports. The Generator utilizes the environment and system specifications to generate both traditional and zero-day attack vectors. The Executor classifies attacks, assigns them to specialized workers for execution, and consolidates the results into a comprehensive report. The Defender then analyzes this report to iteratively enhance the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This iterative process enhances the system’s resilience and robustness to future, unknown threats. The framework is adaptable, allowing customization to meet the security needs of various organizations making it well-suited for applications such as enterprise cloud security, cybersecurity education, and beyond. Future work will focus on building a simplified version of the system, which will later be expanded into a scalable architecture capable of addressing more intricate attack scenarios.},

  abstract={ChatBot technology has become a widely used in various application fields. An important topic in the research on conversational robots is the improvement of their temperature during operation for enhanced user interaction. In this study, we propose an artificial intelligence affective conversational robot (AIACR), which is an integration of an artificial intelligence deep learning sentiment analysis model and generative-and retrieval-based dialogue models. The sentiment analysis model developed in this study uses three models, namely, multilayer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). Moreover, word2vec and semantics are utilized as the basis for similarity ranking models. The deep learning dialogue model, sentiment analysis model, and similarity model were integrated and compared as well. The experimental results show that the sentiment analysis model, similarity model, and dialogue model respectively utilize BiLSTM, word2vec, and the retrieval-based model to achieve the best dialogue performance. The major research contributions of this study are the developed AIACR and the proposed affective conversational robot index (ACR Index) as a criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of emotional dialogue robots.},

  abstract={In this research, we investigate the influence of utilizing artificial intelligence (AI)-generated photographs on malicious bots that engage in disinformation, fraud, reputation manipulation, and other types of malicious activity on social networks. Our research aims to compare the performance metrics of social bots that employ AI photos with those that use other types of photographs. To accomplish this, we analyzed a dataset with 13 748 measurements of 11 423 bots from the VK social network and identified 73 cases where bots employed generative adversarial network (GAN)-photos and 84 cases where bots employed diffusion or transformers photos. We conducted a qualitative comparison of these bots using metrics such as price, survival rate, quality, speed, and human trust. Our study findings indicate that bots that use AI-photos exhibit less danger and lower levels of sophistication compared to other types: AI-enhanced bots are less expensive, less popular on exchange platforms, of inferior quality, less likely to be operated by humans, and, as a consequence, faster and more susceptible to being blocked by social networks. We also did not observe any significant difference between GAN-based and diffusion/transformers-based bots, indicating that diffusion/transformers models did not contribute to increased bot sophistication compared to GAN models. Our contributions include a proposed methodology for evaluating the impact of photos on bot sophistication, along with a publicly available dataset for other researchers to study and analyze bots. Our research findings suggest a contradiction to theoretical expectations: in practice, bots using AI-generated photos pose less danger.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has shown great potential to assist in the creation of picture books. The fairy tale of The Little Match Girl was adapted in this study to explore the application of GAI in “story creation” and “illustration creation” by combining human creativity and AI generation technology to produce a six-page picture book. Furthermore, the performance of AI and a human in the process of the adaption was compared and analyzed. During story creating stage, the researcher of this study employed ChatGPT to generate story structure and creative elements. ChatGPT had a great accomplishment of condensing and narrating stories, but its adjustment on emotional tones required human interventions to achieve the desired effect. Although there were several modifications prior to the ultimate ending to “war” and “tragedy” requested by the researcher, ChatGPT did still show excellent creative potential. When creating illustrations, the researcher used ChatGPT to generate commands and Midjourney to generate illustrations. With character setting and costume details requiring human tweaking and integration, Midjourney excelled at color grading and atmosphere simulation, but having consistency between details and style was a challenging task for Midjourney. In the process of selecting and modifying generated content, AI tools played an important role in inciting creative ideas. The results of this study indicated that GAI was feasible to improve creation efficiency and inspire creativity; however, human intervention was still needed in details and accuracy. As an auxiliary tool, AI could effectively support artistic creation, but achieving the desired results required fine adjustment by humans. It is hoped that this study can serve as a reference direction for future artistic creation.},

  abstract={In today’s world, there is a drastic change in how tools are auto-generating content. These content generation tools that use generative AI make it easier to write blogs, generate content, reply to emails, create and publish content quickly, parse text, and refer to specific information very quickly and with ease. Students use these tools in colleges and educational institutions daily on social media. GenAI tools help reconstruct sentences, correct grammar, use proper words, auto-filling information, and preempt words that make the user not think but instead follow the prompts. GenAI will impact future generations because they cannot be self-reliant and rely heavily on artificial intelligence to form sentences and write the essential content. There must be a need for AI awareness and governance adoption in AI applications and tools as an integral process with a balance on how AI adoption in educational and social networks should enrich and promote individuals in the learning process and dynamically adjust to the individual requirements and help them in crafting sentences intelligently, build information and ideas that encourage thinking process, and using standard English conventions and expression of ideas. The primary focus of this paper is to introduce the challenges of GenAI adoption in applications and tools we use daily and its exposure to Gen X, Gen Y, Gen Z, and Gen Alpha. In this paper, we will bring awareness to such GenAI tools that can adversely impact the growth of individual cognitive thinking processes and the measures that citizens should take so that Human Intelligence prevails over Artificial Intelligence.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated media misinformation poses a significant threat to public trust, societal stability, and legitimacy online. Rapid advancements in AI-generated media in the forms of text and image misinformation, have made it increasingly accessible for the public to create media that can deceive and manipulate public opinion on a large scale. This study provides a comprehensive review of the current methodologies for detecting AI-generated textual and image misinformation, identifying key challenges in the field, and highlighting opportunities for further exploration to enhance detection capabilities. Key to this study are natural language processing and convolutional neural network techniques, which provides a framework for developing tools for the identification and detection of AI-generated textual and image misinformation. Notably, RoBERTa-based models have demonstrated an accuracy of up to 99.2% in detecting AI-generated tweets, underscoring the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in addressing this growing issue.

  abstract={The aim of this study is to apply and characterize eXplainable AI (XAI) to assess the quality of synthetic health data generated using a data augmentation algorithm. In this exploratory study, several synthetic datasets are generated using various configurations of a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from a set of 156 observations related to adult hearing screening. A rule-based native XAI algorithm, the Logic Learning Machine, is used in combination with conventional utility metrics. The classification performance in different conditions is assessed: models trained and tested on synthetic data, models trained on synthetic data and tested on real data, and models trained on real data and tested on synthetic data. The rules extracted from real and synthetic data are then compared using a rule similarity metric. The results indicate that XAI may be used to assess the quality of synthetic data by (i) the analysis of classification performance and (ii) the analysis of the rules extracted on real and synthetic data (number, covering, structure, cut-off values, and similarity). These results suggest that XAI can be used in an original way to assess synthetic health data and extract knowledge about the mechanisms underlying the generated data.},

  abstract={Recent advances in 3D sensor technology have advanced 3D imaging systems. This sparks interest in 3D picture feature extraction and categorization. According to the literature, textural content is essential to visuals. In this case, we extract texture characteristics from three-dimensional photos to improve feature differentiation. Category of volumetric data with texture is possible using this method. We employ feature vectors from Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix methods to achieve this. The visual pattern and volumetric data contrast, homogeneity, and local anisotropy are described. The proposed approach was tested using a publicly accessible dataset of modified volumetric textured pictures. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are classified. Our solution outperforms manually constructed techniques for extracting texture characteristics from 3D and 2D data and standard deep-learning networks. Even with few photographs per class, the recommended method improves class distinction and yields good results. Show exceptional accuracy. Integrating the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) with Local Binary Patterns (LBP) improved classification performance. The GLCM approach, which captures spatial relationships, and the LBP method, which depicts local texture, was advantageous. This hybrid method improved feature extraction and classification, notably for complex 3D medical pictures with subtle texture changes.},

  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={86391-86402},
  abstract={While human brains have the ability to distinguish face characteristics, the use of advanced technology and artificial intelligence blurs the difference between actual and modified images. The evolution of digital editing applications has led to the fabrication of very lifelike false faces, making it harder for humans to discriminate between real and made ones. Because of this, techniques like deep learning are being used increasingly to distinguish between real and artificial faces,producing more consistent and accurate results. In order to detect fraudulent faces, This paper introduces a pioneering hybrid deep learning model, which merges the capabilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and the Residual Neural Network (RESNET) architecture, aimed at detecting fake faces. By integrating GANs’ generative strength with RESNET’s discriminative abilities, the proposed model offers a novel approach to discerning real from artificial faces. Through a comparative analysis, the performance of the hybrid model is evaluated against established pre-trained models such as VGG16 and RESNET 50. Results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the hybrid model in accurately detecting fake faces, marking a notable advancement in facial image recognition and authentication. The findings on a benchmark dataset show that the proposed model obtains outstanding performance measures, including precision 0.79, recall 0.88, F1-score 0.83, accuracy 0.83, and ROC AUC Score 0.825. The study’s conclusions highlight the hybrid model’s strong performance in identifying fake faces, especially when it comes to accuracy, precision, and memory economy. By combining the generative capacity of GANs with the discriminative capabilities of RESNET, this solves the problems caused by more complex fake face generation approaches.With significant potential for use in identity verification, social media content moderation, cybersecurity, and other areas, the study seeks to advance the field of false face identification. In these situations, being able to accurately discriminate between real and altered faces is crucial. Notably, our suggested model adds Channel-Wise Attention Mechanisms to RESNET50 at the feature extraction phase, which increases its effectiveness and boosts its overall performance.},

  abstract={With the expansion of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the penetration of AI chatbots into every aspect of people's daily lives, discussions and issues related to AI ethics and responsibility began to arise simultaneously. A large portion of AI users remain ignorant of such ethical discussions, while a significant percentage of developers lack precautionary measures to prevent irresponsible AI behaviors. An increasing number of companies and organizations are taking action to address the problems. Despite the efforts, prominent issues still prevail. Most existing solutions are too general and theoretical; few are narrowed down to examine the specific application scenario of AI chatbots in education. In response, this study aims to address the arising concerns and the lack of a satisfying solution. After conducting an extensive literature review and performing a detailed analysis of survey data, this study develops a comprehensive guideline about AI ethics and responsible AI, which specifically targets undergraduate developers and guides them during their development of AI chatbots used in education. This guideline successfully bridges the knowledge gap, raises awareness about AI ethics, and acts as the first guideline for undergraduate students, influencing future development practices.},

  abstract={Multimodal remote sensing images contain complementary information, thus, could potentially benefit many remote sensing applications. To this end, the image registration is a common requirement for utilizing the multimodal images. However, due to the rather different imaging mechanisms, multimodal image registration becomes much more challenging than ordinary registration, particular for optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In this work, we design a deep matching network to exploit the latent and coherent features between multimodal patch pairs for inferring their matching labels. But, the network requires immense data for training, which is not usually met. To address this issue, we propose a generative matching network (GMN) to generate the coupled optical and SAR images, hence, improve the quantity and diversity of the training data. The experimental results show that our proposal significantly improves the registration performance of optical and SAR image registration, and achieves subpixel or close to subpixel error.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is currently one of the most popular research topics in machine learning. It mainly uses two competing networks, a generator network and a discriminator network to learn from the distribution of real samples. The complexity of the real sample distribution leads to many problems in the stability of the generative adversarial network in the training process. The Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) were introduced to solve some problem. The performance quality of the results has been significantly improved by DCGAN, but it still sometimes fails to produce realistic data.Due to the deficiencies above DCGAN, this paper involves the capsule network structure into the conditional generation adversarial network, and proposes the CapsuleCGAN (Capsule Conditional Generative Adverserial Networks) architecture. Through the experiment on the MNIST dataset, comparing CGAN and DCGAN, the results show that the proposed CapsuleCGAN architecture can be successfully trained. From the experimental results, not only the high-quality images can be generated, but also in generating maps as diversity. Finally, we put some forward suggestions and ideas for improvement in the future work.},

  abstract={Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been increasingly popular among deep learning methods. With many GANs-based models developed since its emergence, among which are conditional generative adversarial networks, progressive growing of generative adversarial networks, Wasserstein generative adversarial networks and so on. These frameworks are currently widely applied in areas such as remote sensing cybersecurity, medical, and architecture. Especially, they have solved problems of cloud removal, semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation and data argumentation in remote sensing. For example, WGANs and ProGANs can be applied in data argumentation, and cGANs can be applied in semantic argumentation and image-to-image translation. This article provides an overview of structures of multiple GANs-based models and what areas they can be applied in remote sensing.},

  year={2023},

  abstract={Dataset development for machine learning (ML) is considered a challenging and time-consuming process because of the significant resources needed for preprocessing. Automated pipelines for retrieving and preprocessing large amounts of data are not always so readily available. This article examines the benefits of using self-attention ML object detection approaches in the image preprocessing stage in an autonomous manner. We focus on the case where the required preprocessing is text (noise) removal from architectural images. The model we develop is based on the state-of-the-art Text Spotting Transformer (TESTR) framework.By using our TESTR model, we demonstrate that identification and removal of unwanted text annotations on architectural floor plan image datasets are feasible. The impact of inference threshold and image scale on the removal performance is investigated. Optimal thresholds are derived between leaving text and inadvertently removing (building) content. The lower the image scale, the worse the object detection performance. Our pipeline could be used for the preprocessing of huge image datasets for removing obsolete/unwanted annotations and features to improve performance during generative adversarial network (GAN) model training.This could boost efforts to make artificial intelligence systems automatically offer suggestions and refine the building design. The application of TESTR to the architectural image data preprocessing stage as a tool for text and numerical content removal has shown promise. The recognizer decoder of TESTR provides the ability to retain the removed content information for further labeling.},

  abstract={Summary <p>The ideas behind mindset are closely tied to the idea of organizational culture &#x2013; which is also often either an aid or impediment to the successful adoption of new technologies. As GenAI becomes more powerful and more widely accessible, how proficient we become at putting it to work in order to drive efficiency and create value will increasingly become a driver of success. Competition for talent &#x2013; especially AI&#x2010;literate talent &#x2013; is intense. So having put all that thought into essential skills, and equipping people with the skills for success, it makes sense that we really want talent to stick around. The base layer is fast networks and connectivity, data infrastructure, and cybersecurity. These three are the foundational tech building blocks that will help us leverage GenAI (and other cutting&#x2010;edge technologies) successfully. Before making any decisions about GenAI technologies, it's really important to get our foundational technologies right.</p>},

  abstract={Summary <p>GenAI will play a key role in the video game industry that one survey of video game execs found that GenAI is expected to contribute to more than half of video game development within the next 5&#x2013;10 years &#x2013; freeing up game designers from the more mundane development work and helping to reduce costs and development time. GenAI is likely to bring huge changes to the video game industry by automating some of the menial development and testing tasks, and enabling the creation of truly dynamic games. In other words, while GenAI can help to unlock huge efficiencies in game development workflows, perhaps the biggest win of all is for the game&#x2010;playing experience. In the future, GenAI will enable games to evolve dynamically based on the individual player, with characters and the storyline reacting to the player's style and strategy.</p>},

  abstract={This paper proposes a novel network named CAGAN, which is used for passive non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. We used the generative adversarial network (GAN) network for image reconstruction in the passive NLOS field for the first time. We introduce a novel module channel-aware feature fusion module (CAFE) and insert it into the backbone network to capture the interdependence among all channels through their similarity. It adaptively highlights important reconstruction information and suppresses background interference factors. The proposed CAGAN is evaluated on the public data set NLOS-Passive, and the results show that CAGAN is superior to the existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, and CSE.},

  abstract={Ultrasound images are quite useful for doctors to diagnose the kidney diseases nowadays. Since the U-Net network was proposed, it has been applied in the field of ultrasonic image segmentation. We propose a method that combine the U-Net with the generic advantageous networks, creating a more efficient approach of the segmentation of renal ultrasound images. By introducing GAN's supervision mechanism, the segmented network has a better performance. We constructed a training set of 200 renal ultrasound images and a test set composed of 40 images, and carried out experiments on them. Experiments show that compared with the traditional U-Net, the method proposed in this paper improves the accuracy on the same test set. The accuracy of our network reaches 97.83%, which is higher than 97.00% of U-Net.},

  abstract={The process of =making an Artificial intelligent system to replicating human emotional understanding and adapt its responses contextually by tailoring its responses based on individual cognitive and emotional states is called Artificial Personalized Intelligence (API). In this paper, we present a finetuned emotionally adaptive AI pipeline capable of generating personalized, human-like responses. Using a custom dataset based on six universal emotions—Sadness, Happiness, Fear, Anger, Surprise, and Disgust—collected from interviews with 30 participants, we have explored two approaches: fine-tuning a LLaMA-3 8B model with the Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) technique and employing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent-based framework over the same LLaMA-3 8B model. Emotion classification, prompt engineering, and model fine-tuning were used over the dataset to capture emotional and personalized subtleties in the responses based on different individuals. We conducted a comprehensive analysis, evaluating performance across candidates, emotions, and overall performance, using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient to measure the difference among the outputs from both pipelines and actual human emotional responses. Our results show that prompt engineering combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning significantly enhances the ability to engage in emotionally intelligent and personalized conversations, whereas the RAG-based approach underperformed due to the pretrained LLAMA-3 model’s restrictive neutral and adversarial training. This highlights that fine-tuned LLMs are effective in replicating human emotions for personalized intelligence.},

  abstract={This research explores the innovative integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in game development, focusing on the autonomous creation, development, and governance of a virtual village by AI agents within a 2D game environment. The core of this study lies in observing and analyzing the interactions and societal development among AI agents, utilizing advanced algorithms for generative behavior modeling and dynamic skill tree learning. These AI agents are endowed with human-like decision-making capabilities, enabled by LLMs, allowing them to engage in complex social interactions and contribute to emergent societal structures within the game. The uniqueness of this project stems from its approach to simulating lifelike social dynamics in a virtual setting, thus addressing a gap in existing research and marking a significant contribution to the interdisciplinary fields of artificial intelligence and game development. By comparing AI-generated societal behaviors with human social interactions, the study delves into the potential of AI to mirror or enhance human social structures, offering a fresh perspective on the capabilities of AI in game development. This research not only aims to push the boundaries of AI applications in game development but also seeks to provide valuable insights into the potential for AI-driven simulations in studying complex social and behavioral dynamics.},
