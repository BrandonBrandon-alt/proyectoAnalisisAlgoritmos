  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology that finds its application in various industries. Integration of AI in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can lead to tremendous growth in the field of UAVs by improving flight safety and efficiency. Machine learning algorithms can enable UAVs to make real-time decisions in complex environments and reach the optimal solution that aims to fulfill a mission's requirements within the hardware constraints such as battery and payload. Several recent works in UAVs employed a variety of machine learning algorithms to enhance the capabilities of UAVs and assist them. Although several reviews have been published examining the various aspects of AI for UAVs, they are all pertaining to particular applications or technologies. Addressing this research gap, we present a comprehensive and diversified review to enable researchers to analyze the current and future requirements and develop the latest solutions utilizing AI. We have classified the reviewed works based on three different classification schemes: 1) application scenario-based, 2) AI algorithm-based, and 3) AI training paradigm-based. We have also presented a compilation of frameworks, tools, and libraries used in AI-integrated UAV systems. We identified that the integration of AI in UAVs has a wide array of applications ranging from path planning to resource allocation. We have observed that Reinforcement Learning based algorithms are more often used in AI-integrated UAV systems than other AI algorithms. Further, our findings reveal that UAV frameworks employing federated learning and other distributed machine learning paradigms are quickly emerging. Furthermore, we also have put forth several challenges and potential applications of AI-integrated UAV systems.},

  title={Understanding Structure Of LLM using Neural Cluster Knockout}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={253-259},
  abstract={This research work presents a groundbreaking approach at the intersection of neuroscience and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on the application of neuroscience techniques to neural networks, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). Central to this study is the concept of ‘neural cluster knockout’ in LLMs, a method inspired by lesion studies in neuroscience involving the systematic removal of neuron clusters to decipher their role within the model. The research underscores the opaque nature of neural networks, particularly LLMs, which are often critiqued for their ‘black box’ operation. By adopting neuroscience principles, particularly lesion studies, this paper aims to illuminate the inner workings of neural networks, enhancing our understanding of their functionalities. This is crucial in an era increasingly reliant on AI in various sectors, where insights from this study could lead to the development of more efficient, transparent, and accountable AI systems. Methodologically, this study involved Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and neural cluster knockout through iterative zeroing, applied to the Large Language Model named LLaMA. This approach enabled the identification of significant neuron clusters and their functional impacts when deactivated. The results reveal both critical and redundant neurons within LLMs, demonstrating that some clusters are vital for accuracy, while others may impede efficiency or contribute to errors. This research contributes significantly to the AI field, offering a novel perspective on the intricate architecture of LLMs. It lays a foundation for future advancements in AI, envisioning refined and efficient LLMs capable of more accurate and reliable performance.},

  pages={144126-144142},
  abstract={The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about significant societal changes, necessitating robust AI governance frameworks. This study analyzed the research trends in AI governance within the framework of the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act). This study conducted a bibliometric analysis to examine the publications indexed in the Web of Science database. Our findings reveal that research on AI governance, particularly concerning AI systems regulated by the EU AI Act, remains relatively limited compared to the broader AI research landscape. Nonetheless, a growing interdisciplinary interest in AI governance is evident, with notable contributions from multi-disciplinary journals and open-access publications. Analysis of publications per country revealed that while the United States and China dominate AI governance research, European countries, along with the United Kingdom, also contribute significantly with a focus on specific systems restricted by the Act. Dominant research themes include ethical considerations, privacy concerns, and the growing impact of generative AI, such as ChatGPT. Notably, education, healthcare, and worker management are prominent application domains. Keyword network analysis highlights education, ethics, and ChatGPT as central keywords, underscoring the importance of these areas in current AI governance research. Subsequently, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken based on the bibliometric analysis findings to identify research trends, challenges, and insights within the categories of the EU AI Act. This review revealed critical gaps in research concerning regulated AI systems, highlighting the need for more focused research aligned with the Act’s regulatory framework. The findings provide valuable insights for researchers and policymakers, informing future research directions and contributing to developing comprehensive AI governance frameworks beyond the EU AI Act. Crucially, the study identifies a significant lag between AI technological advancement and the development of policy and regulation, especially concerning specific AI systems categorized as high-risk by the EU AI Act.},

  abstract={One of the most innovative ways to identify liver cancer is using deep learning. In medical image analysis, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) reliably detect potential tumors in CT, MRI, and ultrasonography. The potential for improved patient outcomes and early detection is great with this research. The use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to interpret time-series data, including blood tests, offers an alternate method. RNNs may help with early risk prediction and personalized monitoring plan development. The interpretability of AI models, data quality, and seamless integration into healthcare processes are still problems, though. Advances in data synthesis, explainable AI (XAI), and userfriendly interfaces are addressing these challenges. Future prospects appear bright thanks to emerging technologies like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and customized medical approaches that leverage several data sources. Collaboration between researchers, healthcare providers, and technology companies is necessary to accelerate innovation and ensure that it is more broadly available.},

  abstract={In current trends, poetry is a creative expression of thoughts and emotions which manifesting as sequences of words to express ideas in an imaginative style for Automatic generation of poetry. Natural Language Generation (NLG) and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) generally create a new poem. But the generative AI has lack of poem originality, has limited content which is failed in generating deeper information on the related topic and heavily struggling to create the new concepts with sequential words. To overcome these issues, the model of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 with fine tuning (GPT-2-FT) is proposed which is coherent for adapting various forms and contexts to avoid nonsensical sequence of text words. Initially, Poem Generation dataset is used, then in preprocessing, input tokens are divided into different individual words and gives it as input to training words. The proposed GPT-2-FT gives an accurate value and also handles the emotions of poem by Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which including generator and discriminator. The proposed GPT-2-FT gives improved results in terms of Coherence, accuracy and fluency which values are given by (8.777), (0.998) and (0.975) respectively than existing Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) model.},

  pages={111-118},
  abstract={Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, as the core technology in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, such as self-driving vehicles, make important decisions by performing a variety of data classification or prediction tasks. Attacks on data or algorithms in AI applications can lead to misclassification or misprediction, which can fail the applications. For each dataset separately, the parameters of ML algorithms should be tuned to reach a desirable classification or prediction accuracy. Typically, ML experts tune the parameters empirically, which can be time consuming and does not guarantee the optimal result. To this end, some research suggests an analytical approach to tune the ML parameters for maximum accuracy. However, none of the works consider the ML performance under attack in their tuning process. This paper proposes an analytical framework for tuning the ML parameters to be secure against attacks, while keeping its accuracy high. The framework finds the optimal set of parameters by defining a novel objective function, which takes into account the test results of both ML accuracy and its security against attacks. For validating the framework, an AI application is implemented to recognize whether a subject's eyes are open or closed, by applying k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm on her Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this application, the number of neighbors (k) and the distance metric type, as the two main parameters of kNN, are chosen for tuning. The input data perturbation attack, as one of the most common attacks on ML algorithms, is used for testing the security of the application. Exhaustive search approach is used to solve the optimization problem. The experiment results show k = 43 and cosine distance metric is the optimal configuration of kNN for the EEG dataset, which leads to 83.75% classification accuracy and reduces the attack success rate to 5.21%.},

  abstract={This book emphasizes the applications of advances in data processing methods for Artificial Intelligence in today's fast-changing world, as well as to serve society through research, innovation, and development in this field. This book is applicable to a wide range of data that contribute to data science concerns and can be used to promote research in this high-potential new field. People's perceptions of the world and how they conduct their lives have changed dramatically as a result of technological advancements. The world has been gripped by technology, and the advances that are being made every day are undeniably transforming the planet. In the domains of Big Data, engineering, and data science, this cutting-edge technology is ready to support us. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a current research topic because it can be applied to a wide range of applications and disciplines to solve complicated problems and find optimal solutions. In research, medicine, technology, and the social sciences, the benefits of AI have already been proven. Data science, also known as pattern analytics and mining, is a technique for extracting useful and relevant information from databases, enabling better decision-making and strategy formulation in a range of fields. As a result of the exponential growth of data in recent years, the combined notions of big data and AI have given rise to many study areas, such as scale-up behaviour from classical algorithms. Furthermore, combining numerous AI technologies from other areas (such as vision, security, control, and biology) in order to build efficient and durable systems that interact in the real world is a new problem. Despite recent improvements in fundamental AI technologies, the integration of these skills into larger, trustworthy, transparent, and maintainable systems is still in its development. Both conceptually and practically, there are a number of unanswered issues.},

  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in 6G demonstrates a transformative leap in redefining network efficiency, intelligence, and adaptability. However, AI largely leverages discriminative models relying on labelled and quality data, where data accessibility remains serious concern. Generative AI (GenAI) has gained traction due to its immense potential in resolving the issue of data scarcity, complexity, and incompleteness. GenAI models excel in understanding underlying data distributions, enabling them to generate synthetic data that mirrors real-world patterns. GenAI supports adaptive learning and scenario modeling, making it indispensable for addressing the unpredictability and complexity inherent in 6G networks. Since the complexity of wireless communication systems is increasing and the demand for such systems is growing, GenAI presents new ideas for enhancing network performance, increasing system efficiency, and developing intelligent decision-making capabilities. This survey paper investigates the promising role of GenAI in the evolution of 6G networks. An in-depth discussion of notable GenAI models is presented, outlining their application in enhancing key network components. Specifically, the application of GenAI in advanced technologies including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), digital twins (DTs), and integrated sensing and communications (ISACs) is thoroughly investigated with respect to optimize the adaptability, flexibility, and robustness of the wireless networks. Moreover, use cases of GenAI-enabled wireless networks are presented to highlight the realization of GenAI in 6G. The paper also presents the lessons learned, existing challenges, and future research directions. This paper systematically explores GenAI and its pivotal role in the development of 6G, providing a foundation for researchers to further investigate and advance GenAI-enabled 6G.},

  abstract={Consumer electronic devices are popular in human’s everyday use, and cover a wide range of devices and services. Consumer electronics like smartphone and tablet use digital technologies to enhance human’s entertainment and health. The creation of digital content or data augmentation sometimes requires using generative artificial intelligence technologies. Although data generation systems have been successfully used in some consumer products, it is still challenging to create a powerful generative system due to the complexity of input signals and the difficulty of model training. In this paper, a multistage evolutionary generative adversarial network (GAN) framework is proposed to alleviate the above challenges. The multistage evolutionary GAN is a general framework and can be instantiated to existing evolutionary GAN and its variants. Moreover, this paper designs a two-stage and a three-stage evolutionary GAN methods. The two models show that different variation operators and evaluation methods can be used in different stages. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed methods are effective in capturing complex input signals and alleviating the model training problem. The proposed methods can greatly facilitate the application of image generation systems in consumer products.},

  abstract={We live in the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which permeates all aspects of our lives, from spam filtering to image classification on social media. While it is already well-established in industries ranging from heavy manufacturing to the IT field, its impact on the design professions remains relatively unexplored. This essay explores the use of neural networks in architecture, which is arguably the first genuinely 21st-century design technique and discusses experiments with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate unexplored futuristic possible noble forms in architecture.

  abstract={English writing is a big challenge for the English as Foreign Language (EFL) learners due to the lack the lexical resources to inspire them for writing. However, we developed the mobile app, namely Smart UEnglish with the smart mechanisms by integrating multiple recognition technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) to help learners practice meaningful English writing in authentic contexts. Through the smart mechanisms like the integration of speech-to-text (STR), image-to-text recognition (ITR), and generative-AI, the learners could receive not only lexical resources but also sample sentences generated by AI (AI-GS) to inspire them to make meaningful writing. A total of 71 undergraduate students from two classes were assigned to two groups. The experimental group (EG) learns with Smart UEnglish including ITR, STR, and AI-GS. Meanwhile, the control group (CG) learns with ITR and STR only. The mix-method was used to analyze the study deeply. The results found that the EG outperformed the CG in the posttest. The ITR-generated texts as input for AI-GS could inspire the learners by giving the sample sentences before they write the essay. The use of ITR is the predictive variable in the post-test. In addition, the learners in EG have high positive perceptions towards Smart UEnglish. Hence, the integration of multiple recognition technologies and AI in the Smart UEnglish could facilitate EFL learners to learn meaningful writing in authentic contexts.},

  abstract={This research paper explores the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) techniques to create synthetic medical datasets that balance data realism and privacy preservation. The sensitivity of medical records poses challenges for data access and sharing, making GAI a promising solution. The study evaluates five key approaches—StyleGAN2, CLIP, T5, ViT, and specialized Tabular GANs—across three critical dimensions: distribution fidelity, attribute correlation preservation, and pattern recognition accuracy. The results reveal the strengths and limitations of each technique in generating realistic medical data. StyleGAN2, CLIP, and T5 excel in all dimensions, making them ideal for various applications requiring high-quality synthetic medical datasets. ViT shows promise but may need fine-tuning for specific use cases, while specialized Tabular GANs demonstrate potential but vary in performance. This comparative analysis provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners at the intersection of Generative AI and healthcare data generation. It underscores the potential of Generative AI in addressing the tabular data generation challenge in medical records, offering realistic and privacy-conscious alternatives for data utilization and model training.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) plays an imperative role in next-generation critical infrastructures like the smart grid, whose power can be harnessed by not only operators, but also cyber adversaries. This article investigates a potential threat from adversarial AI in blind false data injection attacks (FDIA) targeting the ac state estimators in the smart grid. Assuming no access to the grid topology required in most FDIA, we propose an adversarial model based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) to infer grid topology from historical measurements. Following the topology inference, a substitute bad data detector (BDD) model is further proposed in the attack model to filter the false data before injection, reducing the risk of detection given potential bad data in normal operations. We also refine the common evaluation of FDI stealthiness by including the presence of bad data among normal and false data when assessing the detection performance. Simulations on the IEEE 30-bus system reveal that significant deviations can be inflicted stealthily by the proposed blind FDI attack. Detailed analyses of the stealthiness, impacts, and parameters are also presented to shed more light on the threats for further studies and effective countermeasures.},

This study provides an in-depth comparative analysis of multiple neural network models applied to the CIFAR-10 dataset, with a particular focus on the performance of the Darts-SEBnet model. By incorporating a self-attention mechanism, the Darts-SEBnet model demonstrates a significant improvement in accuracy over the baseline VGG16 model.

The imbalanced dataset is characterized as having a huge difference between the number of samples that contain each class. Unfortunately, various resampling methods are proposed to solve this problem. In our work, we target enhancing the handling of the imbalanced dataset using a new oversampling technique based on generative adversarial neural networks. Our method is benchmarked against the widely used oversampling technique including the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), random oversampling technique (ROS), and the adaptive synthetic sampling approach(ADSYN). Additionally, three machine learning algorithms are used for evaluation. The outcome of our experiments on a real-world credit card dataset shows the strong ability of the proposed solution against the competitive oversampling techniques to overcome the imbalanced problem in the European credit card dataset.},

  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into innovation management has expanded into creative domains such as design thinking (DT), yet its role within complex, collaborative innovation frameworks remains underexplored. This article addresses this gap by investigating how professionals perceive and utilize AI in DT workshops. Using affordance theory as a conceptual lens, we conducted observational studies and semistructured interviews with DT experts to identify AI's action potentials, constraints, and mitigation strategies in this context. Our findings highlight four key affordances of AI in DT workshops: enhanced creativity, support for analytical tasks, facilitation of task initiation, and acceleration of processes. However, these benefits are tempered by challenges, including reduced team collaboration, diminished ownership of AI-generated outputs, and disruptions to workshop flow. The article reveals distinct human–AI interaction archetypes, underscoring the dynamic interplay between human expertise and AI capabilities. To mitigate constraints, we propose strategies such as prepreparing AI-generated content, defining clear roles for AI and human inputs, and fostering collaborative reflection on AI outputs. By illuminating AI's potential and limitations within DT, this article contributes to the innovation management literature and offers actionable insights for practitioners seeking to integrate AI into hybrid innovation processes.},

  abstract={Summary <p>The term &#x201c;artificial intelligence&#x201d; (AI) refers to a remarkable technology enabling computers to carry out activities consistent with human behavior. It was in 1956 that John McCarthy first used the term &#x201c;artificial intelligence,&#x201d; and since then, it has become an indispensable component of our everyday life. AI is now the most widely used source of computation, and its applications range from automated voice systems to personalized movie suggestions. On the other hand, these systems depend on intricate methods such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. As the way we interact with technology continues to be revolutionized by AI, it is essential to consider the potential privacy and security risks that come with it. Specifically, gathering and utilizing sensitive patient information to train AI models has given rise to significant issues. Patients, healthcare providers, and software vendors can suffer serious repercussions due to any utilization or disclosure of patient information. As a result of these worries, this chapter investigates the development and incorporation of AI into our health and information systems, with a particular emphasis on protecting personal information and safety.</p>},

  abstract={This paper investigates the emerging field of emotional engineering which takes the form of a marriage between generative artificial intelligence (AI) and emotional intelligence that is set to redefine the future of human-machine collaboration. With the latest advances in AI having allowed for broad understanding and generation of human-like emotional responses, this paper illuminates the frameworks for creating systems that are capable of empathizing with and responding to the emotions of human users that can be widely applied across domains such as healthcare and customer service. The findings here indicate that user experiences can be drastically improved through applications such as those which allow for machines to accompany emotional intelligence, as they can enable more empathetic interactions. Emotion AI isn’t about having "feelings" in the human sense — it’s more about accurate and relevant emotional interaction. There’s no doubt "emotional engineering" will spawn gadgets that are truly empathetic and not just intelligent, but it also raises large questions about what happens now that we must account for emotions in our digital interactions.},

  year={2024},
  volume={28},
  number={3},
  pages={1504-1515},
  abstract={Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a pervasive disorder affecting millions of individuals, presenting a significant global health concern. Functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) serves as a crucial tool in revealing functional connectivity patterns associated with MDD, playing an essential role in precise diagnosis. However, the limited data availability of FC poses challenges for robust MDD diagnosis. To tackle this, some studies have employed Deep Neural Networks (DNN) architectures to construct Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic FC generation, but this tends to overlook the inherent topology characteristics of FC. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)-based Conditional GAN with Class-Aware Discriminator (GC-GAN). GC-GAN utilizes GCN in both the generator and discriminator to capture intricate FC patterns among brain regions, and the class-aware discriminator ensures the diversity and quality of the generated synthetic FC. Additionally, we introduce a topology refinement technique to enhance MDD diagnosis performance by optimizing the topology using the augmented FC dataset. Our framework was evaluated on publicly available rs-fMRI datasets, and the results demonstrate that GC-GAN outperforms existing methods. This indicates the superior potential of GCN in capturing intricate topology characteristics and generating high-fidelity synthetic FC, thus contributing to a more robust MDD diagnosis.},

  abstract={The success of artificial intelligence (AI) in multiple disciplines and vertical domains in recent years has promoted the evolution of mobile networking and the future Internet toward an AI-integrated Internet of Things (IoT) era. Nevertheless, most AI techniques rely on data generated by physical devices (e.g., mobile devices and network nodes) or specific applications (e.g., fitness trackers and mobile gaming). Therefore, generative AI (GAI), a.k.a. AI-generated content (AIGC), has emerged as a powerful AI paradigm; thanks to its ability to efficiently learn complex data distributions and generate synthetic data to represent the original data in various forms. This impressive feature is projected to transform the management of mobile networking and diversify the current services and applications provided. On this basis, this work presents a concise tutorial on the role of GAIs in mobile and wireless networking. In particular, this survey first provides the fundamentals of GAI and representative GAI models, serving as an essential preliminary to the understanding of GAI’s applications in mobile and wireless networking. Then, this work provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art studies and GAI applications in network management, wireless security, semantic communication, and lessons learned from the open literature.

  abstract={We present an artificial intelligence application system to improve the skills of excise and human health. Captured video images of human exercise are processed so that the images imitates the trainer's motion. We call such images "imitated motion images". We employed imitated motion images of a person to make it easier to imitate trainer's exercises skills by the person. As an experiment for the evaluation of imitated motion images, we performed experiments with our collaborators. Then, we asked the collaborators for their opinions about real and imitated motion images. The results suggest that the imitated motion images are more effective. Because manual processing to produce imitated motion images is too much work, the existing technology, Pose2Pose, is used. When we tested multiple motion images of multiple person, we confirmed that about half of the images could be processed automatically, and it was also confirmed that the effect on the improvement of skills was achieved.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and edge intelligence (EI) are driving the evolution of traditional vehicular networks toward the intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IIoV) by providing foundational and personalized knowledge. However, their inherently contradictory characteristics present significant challenges to direct knowledge sharing. Furthermore, conventional methods that independently optimize fine-tuning and inference lack the foresight to achieve long-term network benefits. To address these challenges, we propose the GAI-oriented synthetic network (GaisNet), a collaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence framework that integrates fine-tuning and inference. GaisNet, specifically, can mitigate contradictions by leveraging data-free knowledge relays, where bidirectional knowledge flow facilitates a virtuous cycle of model fine-tuning and task inference with a long-term perspective, fostering mutualism between GAI and EI in the IIoV. A case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the future challenges and directions in the interplay between GAI and EI.},

  abstract={Contributions: An adoption framework to include generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in the university curriculum. It identifies and highlights the role of different stakeholders (university management, students, staff, etc.) during the adoption process. It also proposes an objective approach based upon an evaluation matrix to assess the success and outcome of the GenAI adoption. Background: Universities worldwide are debating and struggling with the adoption of GenAI in their curriculum. GenAI has impacted our perspective on traditional methods of academic integrity and the scholarship of teaching, learning, and research. Both the faculty and students are unsure about the approach in the absence of clear guidelines through the administration and regulators. This requires an established framework to define a process and articulate the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder involved. Research Questions: Whether the academic ecosystem requires a methodology to adopt GenAI into its curriculum? A systematic approach for the academic staff to ensure the students’ learning outcomes are met with the adoption of GenAI. How to measure and communicate the adoption of GenAI in the university setup? Methodology: The methodology employed in this study focuses on examining the university education system and assessing the opportunities and challenges related to incorporating GenAI in teaching and learning. Additionally, it identifies a gap and the absence of a comprehensive framework that obstructs the effective integration of GenAI within the academic environment. Findings: The literature survey results indicate the limited or no adoption of GenAI by the university, which further reflects the dilemma in the minds of different stakeholders. For the successful adoption of GenAI, a standard framework is proposed 1) for effective redesign of the course curriculum; 2) for enabling staff and students; and 3) to define an evaluation matrix to measure the effectiveness and success of the adoption process.},

  pages={25-29},
  abstract={This study examines how multimedia arts students perceive generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential threat to traditional artistic practices. While AI-powered tools are increasingly integrated into creative processes, offering benefits such as efficiency, expanded techniques, and access to new artistic possibilities, their use has sparked concerns about the declining role of manual skills and the authenticity of AI-generated works. Using Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations Theory as a framework, this research explores student insights through qualitative analysis, including keyword frequency and word cloud visualization. Results indicate a generally positive attitude toward AI’s practical applications, yet students express reservations about its impact on creative identity, originality, and ethical considerations such as copyright and attribution. These findings suggest a need for educational approaches that introduce AI critically and constructively, ensuring that emerging technologies enhance rather than replace human creativity. Future research should explore pedagogical strategies that preserve traditional artistic values while preparing students to navigate an evolving creative landscape.},

  abstract={In recent years, with the rapid development of AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology, it has been increasingly utilized in the field of education. This paper takes the course of Human Resource Management for medical and health management majors as an example and discusses in some detail the potential and practical effectiveness of generative AI in enhancing the efficiency and quality of teaching in this course. This paper uses the case study method to explore the intelligent generation of knowledge points, personalized learning recommendation system, and intelligent homework correction of generative AI in classroom teaching. In addition, this paper evaluates the teaching effect of generative AI from various aspects, such as students’ learning effectiveness, participation, and satisfaction. Through the collection and analysis of relevant data, it is facilitated that generative AI can effectively improve students’ learning motivation and achievement and strengthen the implementation of classroom interaction and individual teaching. The study shows that generative AI can not only improve the quality and efficiency of teaching, but also continuously optimize teaching strategies through data-driven approaches, creating more value for both teachers and students. The case study found that students 001 and 003 were more engaged, as evidenced by the relatively high number of logins, forum postings, and project submissions, and accordingly, their satisfaction scores were higher, at 4 and 5, respectively. In conclusion, the application of generative AI technology in the teaching of Human Resource Management course for medical and health management majors demonstrates its broad prospect in the field of educational technology.},

  title={Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence in the Education of Software Verification and Validation}, 
  year={2024},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Since the introduction of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), education in computer science has prompted efforts to incorporate it into the educational curriculum. This innovative practice full paper presents a study into using GenAI to enhance student learning of software engineering. It outlines the initiatives to introduce GenAI into a graduate-level software engineering course in Software Verification and Validation (SV&V). The paper presents the educational goals, methodologies and findings of these endeavors in this course. The primary education goal of this course is that students have a solid understanding of principles and practices of software quality assurance and seek to introduce students to diverse techniques employed for SV&V. The study presented in this paper centers on the practical application of GenAI within the domain of testing strategies. The paper introduces the findings of an exercise where GenAI was used to apply testing strategies for unit testing. The exercise consisted of the use of GenAI in the development of unit tests for an algorithm. Rigorous assessments were conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the unit tests developed for validating the accurate implementation of the algorithm. This exploration shed light on the tangible impact of GenAI on the precision and efficiency of unit testing procedures. The findings underscore the significance of encouraging students to actively explore emerging trends and methodologies in the realm of software verification and validation. By incorporating GenAI into the educational framework, students not only gain insights into the capabilities and limitations of this technology but also foster a mindset of continuous learning in software quality assurance. The paper demonstrates that it is not sufficient to use the test cases developed by GenAI for software validation since test cases recommended by GenAI do not cover corner cases which causes gaps in coverage in unit testing. The majority of the students were able to understand the limitation of GenAI in SV&V but appreciated its support in suggesting test cases for the most common cases. This exercise allowed students to enhance their creative problem-solving through human-guided AI partnership which is pivotal in cultivating a new generation of professionals capable of contributing to the ongoing evolution of software quality.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={902-906},
  abstract={Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an agile software development approach. It promotes short cycles, composed of three phases each, to incrementally implement software functionality: Red, Green, and Refactor. In the Red Phase, the TDD developer writes a unit test for a small chunk of functionality not yet implemented and watches the test fail. In the Green Phase, the TDD developer writes production code to make the test pass as quickly as possible. Finally, in the refactor phase, the TDD developer “cleans” written code. In this demo paper, we present GAI4-TDD (Generative Artificial Intelligence for Test-Driven Development), a PyCharm plugin to support the Green Phase of TDD. Specifically, this plugin generates production code from the tests the TDD developer had written in the Red Phase so that the generated code makes these tests pass. Previous studies have shown that TDD can be beneficial not only in the “traditional” software development context but also in the Embedded Systems (ESs) development context. We preliminary assessed GAI4-TDD in the latter context through a laboratory empirical study on three ESs. We observed that in the greater part of the cases, GAI4- TDD generates production code that successfully implements the chunk of functionality required. A video showing GAI4- TDD in action is available at: https://youtu.be/30IDb-6NgS4.},

  abstract={Collective reflection is essential for pre-service science teachers' professional development which involves participants generating multiple ideas for their reflection exercises. However, current research revealed that it is a challenge for facilitating collective reflection due to its superficial cognition and intangible quality. Considering generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has been demonstrated to be able to help promote teachers' professional development in a large amount of existing research, this study integrated the ChatGPT 4.0 into preservice science teachers' collective reflection. Due to the dynamic and complicated process of collective reflection, Epistemic network analysis (ENA) approach was employed to trace the development process of 14 pre-service science teachers' collaborative discourse patterns in two collective reflection activities after micro-teaching and traditional classroom teaching. Data analysis results revealed that when the pre-service science teachers used ChatGPT in collective reflection, they demonstrated less active on providing critical feedback and analyzing the causes of problems combined pedagogical knowledge and classroom observation. Furthermore, the pre-service science teachers had different highlights in two collective reflection activities. Suggestions are provided to promote the pre-service science teachers' integrated GAI collective reflection.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This study examines the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and the work environment on the motivation of formal workers in DKI Jakarta Province. Using IBM SPSS 29 for data analysis, 402 formal workers participated via online questionnaires. Results indicate that GAI positively correlates with work motivation (regression coefficient=0.71, t = 10.98, p < 0.001). Likewise, a favourable work climate considerably boosts motivation (β = 0.63, t = 12.21, p < 0.001). Also, the work environment was found to have a significant indirect effect on the GAI-motivation relationship (β = 0.55, p < 0.001). The results of this research imply that the implementation of sophisticated AI technologies and a favourable organisational climate are the keys to increasing employees’ effectiveness and engagement. Despite the study’s short data collection period, the results are indicative. Strategic investments in GAI and improvements in the work environment could significantly enhance the motivation of Jakarta’s 3.08 million formal workers. This paper provides valuable insights into leveraging GAI and work environment factors to improve employee well-being in Jakarta’s dynamic work context.},

  pages={147-149},
  abstract={Literary studies critically examine fictional texts, exploring their structures, themes, stylistic features, and cultural-historical contexts. A central challenge in this field lies in bridging textual analysis with the spatial and sensory dimensions of settings described or implied in texts. Traditional methodologies often require scholars to mentally reconstruct these environments, leading to incomplete or inconsistent interpretations. Readers may be biased by their personal context or experiences, or may lack detailed knowledge of the relevant historical facts. This paper argues for the integration of virtual reality and generative artificial intelligence as supporting instruments to enhance literary research. The former enables immersive, spatially accurate reconstructions of historical environments, while the latter provides tools such as text-to-image and text-to-3D generation which let us dynamically render visual elements quoted in literary texts. Together, these technologies have the potential to significantly enhance traditional literature analysis methodologies, enabling novel approaches for contextualizing and analyzing literature in its spatial and cultural milieu.},

  abstract={The growing complexity of cyber threats requires a smart, decentralized, and tamper-proof method of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). This work suggests a new combination of Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve security, transparency, and real-time threat protection in cybersecurity environments. Our method utilizes blockchain's immutability to provide reliable CTI sharing and AI-based threat analytics for adaptive defense. In this work, a Smart Contract-based AI platform has been designed to facilitate automated threat validation, anomaly detection, and predictive security responses. The platform leverages Federated Learning (FL) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to ensure privacy-preserving and adversarial-resilient intelligence sharing. Our blockchain-driven decentralized platform eliminates single point of failure, enhances traceability, and promotes stakeholder collaboration in contrast to conventional centralized CTI platforms (e.g. G. governments, businesses, and security researchers). Robustness against adversarial attacks, reduced false positives, and improved detection accuracy are demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluation on real cyberattack data sets. The effectiveness of our solution in thwarting Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and zero-day attacks is demonstrated through comparative benchmarking with existing CTI frameworks. As we lay the groundwork for a next-generation, AI-powered blockchain platform for cybersecurity, also consider scalability, regulatory compliance, and integration challenges.},

  abstract={In the digitalizing world, Artificial Intelligence (AI) paves the way for the automation of routine work done by humans and makes life easier. Recently, there is no area where AI and its applications are not used in daily life, from health to education, from transportation to energy, and from agriculture to tourism. AI applications are making rapid progress in the direction of important and current developments, especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL). A concrete example of progress in these areas is the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) language model. AI-assisted GPT-3 technology is the DL model that is effectively used in many NLP fields, which can produce long and consistent content similar to the texts written by people using pre-trained algorithms. The GPT-3 architecture has reached a level that can compete with people in many areas by producing optimum solutions for all kinds of inputs by using the Transformer-based language model, which is an attention-based deep learning technique. This article aims to convey the efficiency, structure and potential of the Transformer-assisted GPT-3 model, which is one of the most up-to-date NLP technologies, to the reader. Since the number of Turkish studies in the field of GPT-3 AI is quite limited, it is considered that this study will contribute to the literature in terms of both quantity and quality. In addition, the performance parameters of the model were examined by making a customized fine-tuned sample application in the beta version of the GPT-3 model.},

Firstly, by introducing spatial attention mechanism, positional attention mechanism and channel attention mechanism, a hybrid attention module is designed. This module not only establishes feature relationship between different locations, but also provides adaptive feature weights to highlight key information. Next, by embedding the hybrid attention module into the generative adversarial network, an improved generative adversarial network model is developed. The proposed model can capture effective feature information in the image and ensures that the generated path can evade obstacles accurately. Finally, some simulation results are provided to verify the superiority and accuracy of the model in path planning.},

  abstract={Summary <p>In the world of artificial intelligence (AI), data acts as the vital force driving machine learning algorithms. Data lays the foundation for the construction of AI systems, and readers need a sufficient quality and quantity of data to make sure that their AI programs perform successfully. Data is the fuel that trains the AI to discern patterns and interpret the inputs provided. Generative AI's ability to automatically read unstructured data and classify it appropriately for future uses is an immensely powerful capability for companies. This chapter explores the importance of data and its collection, storage, and management. The success of using AI to propel marketing and business results directly depends on the quality of data that fuels the AI engines. Machine learning models require a sufficient amount of data to discern patterns and make accurate predictions. Data splitting is the process of dividing the data set into training, validation, and test sets.</p>},

  abstract={Deep learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that has grown quickly and is now widely used in computer software. As the need for deep learning algorithms that can handle more complicated tasks keeps growing very quickly, the improvements in how efficient and productive these algorithms can be utilized for identifying data poisoning is an important step. Data poisoning refers to altering the legitimate data using various techniques and fabricating the expected results. The poisoning will affect the quality of predictions and reliability of the contents generated. The data sensitive applications which rely on classification models for deriving conclusions will be affected by poisoning resulting in unrealistic conclusions and misguided inferences. Continuous occurrence of poorly classified data and unrealistic conclusions will affect the reliability of the system making it less trustworthy. This research looks into long lasting effects of poisoning attacks, which target the training data used in deep learning and assess the way a deep learning model classifies information. Experiments were done to measure the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms in effectively detecting poisoned data. The evaluations were done using KNN, SVM and Logistic Regression models. The analysis concludes that KNN offers better prediction compared to SVM and Logistic Regression. Logistic regression offers less accurate predictions making it unfit for poisoning detection. Proper classification of poisoned data will help research community and users to be aware of legitimacy of data and thereby help them to choose the right data and information for processing, analytics, and deriving conclusions. This will greatly improve the performance and trustworthiness of related models including generative AI systems and makes the learning process un biased which will highly benefit the research community in general.},

  abstract={Arabic calligraphy is one of the most aesthetic art forms in the world due to its variety and long history. However, generating calligraphic style is mainly done by human expert calligrapher (also known as Khattat) and has not been carried out by machine learning techniques. Generative adversarial networks (GAN) are deep learning tools that achieved outstanding results in the field of style transfer and generation. In this paper, various GAN architectures were investigated such as CycleGAN, Pix2pix, and deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) within Arabic calligraphy in two aspects: generation and style transfer. The results show that CycleGAN can transfer skeleton letters to both Naskh and Thulth styles, Pix2Pix can denoise the calligraphy papers, and DCGAN can generate realistic Arabic calligraphy letters. The proposed approaches are applicable for other calligraphy styles besides Naskh and Thulth. Finally, the models are evaluated qualitatively using a preference judgment technique survey.},

  abstract={This paper deals with data pseudonymization when using generative artificial intelligence, specifically ChatGPT. The aim of the research was to experimentally verify whether ChatGPT can maintain the protection of pseudonymized data by not maintaining the link between the anonymized part and personal data. Four requests were tested in the experiment, in which ChatGPT was gradually provided with various combinations of pseudonymized and complete data about customers and their orders. The results showed that ChatGPT does not store previous inputs and is not able to reconstruct personal data retroactively if they were not explicitly provided to it in each request. Based on the results obtained, it can be assumed that the use of ChatGPT when processing pseudonymized data does not pose a risk of violating the protection of personal data. This research seeks to contribute to the discussion on the security of generative artificial intelligence in processing sensitive data and confirms the effectiveness of pseudonymization as a mechanism for protecting personal data.},

  abstract={The rapid rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) with emerging capabilities has spurred public curiosity to evaluate and compare different LLMs, leading many researchers to propose their own LLM benchmarks. Noticing preliminary inadequacies in those benchmarks, we embarked on a study to critically assess 23 state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, using our novel unified evaluation framework through the lenses of people, process, and technology, under the pillars of benchmark functionality and integrity. Our research uncovered significant limitations, including biases, difficulties in measuring genuine reasoning, adaptability, implementation inconsistencies, prompt engineering complexity, evaluator diversity, and the overlooking of cultural and ideological norms in one comprehensive assessment. Our discussions emphasized the urgent need for standardized methodologies, regulatory certainties, and ethical guidelines in light of Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements, including advocating for an evolution from static benchmarks to dynamic behavioral profiling to accurately capture LLMs’ complex behaviors and potential risks. Our study highlighted the necessity for a paradigm shift in LLM evaluation methodologies, underlining the importance of collaborative efforts for the development of universally accepted benchmarks and the enhancement of AI systems’ integration into society.},
