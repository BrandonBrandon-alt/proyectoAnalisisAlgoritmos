  abstract={In the context of the swift advancement and integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into the design realm, comprehending user acceptance of these advanced tools has emerged as a pivotal issue. The primary purpose of this research is to examine and understand the factors influencing user acceptance and behavioral intentions towards generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the design field. To achieve this, this research delineates a multifaceted theoretical model, underpinned by an analysis of user behavioral intentions and their driving factors. The model encapsulates eight principal constructs: intention to continue use, self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, facilitating conditions, expectation confirmation, trust in technology, and social influence. An empirical examination of 13 related hypotheses was conducted. Utilizing data from 339 valid questionnaires, the outcomes of the structural equation modeling lent support to all posited hypotheses. The research delineates that users’ sustained intention to utilize generative AI technology is directly contingent upon factors such as perceived usefulness, satisfaction, self-efficacy, and trust in technology. Notably, perceived usefulness and self-efficacy are identified as pivotal determinants of satisfaction. Furthermore, social influence and expectation confirmation are found to augment perceived usefulness, while facilitating conditions to enhance both self-efficacy and expectation confirmation. These findings yield novel insights into the theory of user behavior, charting a course for the refinement of generative AI design tools. Such enhancements are aimed at fostering a more extensive application and acceptance of these tools in the relevant fields.},

  abstract={Since the inception of artificial intelligence in 1956, it has brought about significant transformations in people's production and daily lives. Artificial intelligence technology is widely applied in various fields due to its capacity to emulate human thinking and learning. Focusing on the creation of cinematic culture, contemporary film production has gradually shifted towards digitization in its processes and virtualization in its content. Consequently, the continuous iterative development of digital filmmaking technology has presented further opportunities for integration with artificial intelligence technology.In the context of virtual production technology expanding to encompass the entire filmmaking process, this paper aims to explore artificial intelligence image technology from the perspective of digital cinema. It elucidates the application characteristics of artificial intelligence technology in the realm of imagery under the current cinematic aesthetics, delves into the future visual marvels constructed by films in the era of artificial intelligence, and thereby further explores the impact of artificial intelligence image technology on the creative concepts of future digital filmmaking, along with the insights and reflections derived from this exploration.},

  pages={521-529},
  abstract={It is still a great challenge for the visually impaired people to perceive their surroundings from a global perspective, which makes it difficult for them to interact with unfamiliar environments. The reason is that these conventional assisting devices only address the obstacle avoidance problem. They do not provide visually impaired people with a global perception of the surrounding environment. In this article, a new generative adversarial network (GAN) model is developed to effectively transform the ground images into the tactile signal, which can be displayed by an off-the-shelf vibration device. The algorithm module and the hardware are integrated into a portable device, which provides visually impaired people with effective surrounding perception capability. In addition, a visual-tactile cross-modal data set is constructed to train the proposed deep-learning architecture. Experimental results show that the proposed system can help visually impaired people sense the ground and bring a better traveling experience for them. Note to Practitioners—This article presents a portable device that provides tactile recognition assistance for visually impaired people. Such a technology can be extensively used in tactile mouse and white cane. The developed technology can be extensively used for various industrial applications, such as surrounding monitoring and manipulation. The proposed work demonstrates the promising ability of artificial intelligence in healthcare applications. The generated tactile signals are expected to be used in many human-centered systems, and we believe that our contribution is an important step toward the development of a more comprehensive assisting technology for visually impaired people.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Fundamental to the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) is the concept of machine learning. Therefore, knowing how these models work is vital to understanding the mechanisms of how AI tools are built. AI systems are built on algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. For machine learning to be effective, it needs the proper training data set. The model is built from machines that use algorithms to learn from the data provided. In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled data to make predictions or classifications. Unsupervised learning uses algorithms that find patterns or structures in unlabeled data. Discriminative AI seeks to classify and differentiate data, essentially learning the differences between different categories of data. Training generative AI models often involve unsupervised learning, enabling the model to digest and understand large amounts of text, images, or videos.</p>},

  abstract={With its use increasingly pervading the learning space in higher education, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools are an inevitable resource that can contribute to the digital milieu of Higher Education. Necessitate by an inevitable need to engage with the GenAI tools in teaching and learning, this paper investigates how we may tap on GenAI response to mathematical problems as a potential resource for learning. Instead of solving the problems firsthand, we harness the GenAI tools for their near-instant solutions to mathematical question prompts that included guidance on the steps provided. We then performed an evaluation of the solutions provided. We find that our approach on the use of GenAI tools, along with the post solution evaluation process, has significant potential in contributing to active learning and critical thinking. More studies can be done to ascertain these benefits with research involving student participation.},

  abstract={This study explored the efficacy of using ChatGPT, a generative AI application, in a sophomore-year undergraduate engineering electronics course focusing on students’ learning of fundamental concepts and circuit problem-solving. As a part of this study, a group of sophomore-year engineering students were assigned a set of electronics circuit problems to solve first using traditional methods, followed by repeating the process using ChatGPT. Their experience was captured in a questionnaire-based survey, which attempted to gauge the perceived efficacy of ChatGPT or similar generative AI in electronics circuit problem-solving against the traditional problem-solving method under five criteria: accuracy, efficiency, learning retention, user experience, and assistance in critical thinking, using a 5-scale evaluation method. Additionally, some open-ended questions were included in the study for a qualitative assessment of ChatGPT’s perceived efficacy. The outcome of this exploratory research prompted a critical examination of the application of generative AI and similar assistive tools in the electronics course. Through the qualitative assessment, this study also identified several potential factors contributing to the observed performance differences between traditional and AI-assisted learning and problem-solving. Results from this study highlighted ChatGPT’s inherent strengths in efficiency and speed, while frequently compromising accuracy by being prone to errors and misinformation. Participants also emphasized the human factor of learning and advocated for the active involvement of instructors in training students in the proper and effective use of AI and similar assistive tools. Insights from this study offer a nuanced understanding of the role of generative AI in engineering education, encouraging further research into optimizing the use of technology in the classroom.},

  abstract={English writing proficiency undoubtedly stands as a crucial metric in assessing students’ English ability. It not only mirrors their vocabulary accrual and grammatical proficiency but also underscores their logical thinking, cultural awareness, and innovative capabilities. However, the challenge in elevating English writing skills stems from both students’ learning attitudes and habits, as well as teachers’ teaching methods and ideologies. To address these obstacles, generative artificial intelligence has been harnessed to fuel a series of teaching reform initiatives, particularly within the realm of English for specific purposes. In order to cultivate greater enthusiasm and proficiency in writing among students, a quasi-experimental teaching study was conducted for a semester among undergraduate civil engineering students. The research findings have shown that the integration of ERNIE Bot 4.0 in ESP courses significantly enhances students’ English writing proficiency and effectively sparks their enthusiasm for writing.},

  abstract={This journal aims to investigate the influence of AI-generated art on illustrator’s job opportunities, copyright ownership and creative process. This journal also aims to investigate how the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has allowed the creation of text-to-image artworks, while simultaneously influencing the demand for illustrators, raising concerns about intellectual property rights, and ethical challenges due to the unauthorized use of artists’ works for training AI models. The methodology used for this journal will be conducted using Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The motivation for conducting SLR is to bridge the gap in understanding both the positive and negative implications of AI-generated art on the creative industry as a whole. Using tools like Publish or Perish and Mendeley, 69 relevant studies from 235 collected papers were analyzed using VOSviewer for visualizing key themes. The results show that AI influences job opportunities by streamlining production processes, disrupts copyright ownership through unauthorized data use, and transforms creative processes by enabling new ideation techniques while automating repetitive tasks. These insights highlight the dual-edged nature of AI in the creative industry and the need for ethical and legal frameworks to address its impacts.},

  pages={196-200},
  abstract={This study employs a quasi-experimental design to compare the effects of generative AI-supported teacher comments (experimental group) and traditional teacher comments (control group) on pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns in microteaching. Using lag sequence analysis, the study analyzes reflective behavior patterns based on 66 pre-service teachers' reflective texts on microteaching. The results indicate that generative AI-supported teacher comments significantly optimize pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns, particularly in terms of breadth and depth. The experimental group's reflective behaviors covered multiple dimensions, including teaching content (CW), teaching process and methods (PW), classroom atmosphere (AW), and teaching evaluation and feedback (EW), demonstrating comprehensiveness. Additionally, their reflective behaviors formed problem chains, such as "teaching content → teaching process → classroom atmosphere" (CW→PW→AW), reflecting stronger logic and depth. In contrast, the control group's reflective behaviors primarily focused on basic teaching skills (BW) and teaching process and methods (PW), with insufficient attention to classroom atmosphere (AW) and teaching evaluation and feedback (EW). Their reflections were more superficial and limited. Based on these findings, the study proposes recommendations to optimize pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns, aiming to enhance their microteaching reflection abilities and, consequently, their teaching competence development.},

  abstract={With the widespread adoption of smartphones over the past decade, mobile applications have become a primary target for malicious attacks, usually in the form of malware. Recent studies have leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for malware detection and classification. However, applying such approaches, particularly deep learning (DL) techniques, to mobile malware detection poses significant challenges. These challenges arise from the difficulty of collecting large quantities of mobile malware samples and the inherent class imbalance in the collected datasets. To tackle these issues and enhance the performance of machine learning (ML) and DL detection models, we propose novel detection models based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). Furthermore, our approach not only employs a conditional tabular GAN (CTGAN) for data augmentation to explore the impact of augmentation but also identifies the optimal multiplication factor for achieving the best results. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation approach significantly improves the performance of mobile malware detection models, especially those based on DL. We have notably figured out that doubling the original dataset is sufficient to enhance the performance of ML models, whereas DL models require additional data to achieve optimal results. Hence, our proposed mechanism is an effective solution for improving mobile malware detection.},

  abstract={A zero-day exploit is an online attack using a previously unknown software or hardware weakness before its vulnerabilities can be tackled by its creators. A zero-day exploit could result in unauthorized access, information loss, and extensive financial gains. Recent works have investigated utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks in predicting and detecting zero-day exploits. In the adversarial process, the discriminator and generator refine detection. Studies conducted between 2022 and 2024 have proved the capability of such models in detecting vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, existing GAN based methods are confronted by various challenges, such as high cost, scalability issues, unstable training, and slow responsiveness to newly emerging exploit attacks, rendering real-time detection of threats less efficient. This project proposes an improved GAN architecture tackling such problems through a hybrid approach merging Conditional or Wasserstein GANs and Reinforcement Learning, Vulnerability Intelligence, Graph Neural Networks, and Autoencoders. This stabilizes training, minimizes computation overhead, and maximizes flexibility to new exploit methods. Our model, with this architecture, will be able to provide more precise detection of zero-day exploits, strengthening cybersecurity defenses beyond existing techniques. This method is designed to be adaptive and scalable so that it can provide long-term security against evolving cyber threats.},

  pages={31576-31588},
  abstract={Humans possess the remarkable capacity to comprehend narratives presented in text and subsequently conjure associated mental images through their imagination. This cognitive ability enhances their grasp of the content and augments their overall enjoyment. Consequently, the development of an automated system aimed at producing visually faithful images based on textual descriptions, often referred to as the text-to-image task, stands as a profoundly meaningful endeavor. For this reason, a variety of text-to-image generating artificial intelligences (AIs) have been devised until now. Nevertheless, the generative AIs introduced thus far encounter an issue wherein they struggle to uphold the coherence of input sentences, particularly when multiple sentences are provided. Within this paper, we present a remedy to this challenge through the application of prompt editing. Furthermore, our experimental results substantiate that our proposed solution more effectively preserves contextual coherence among the generated images in comparison to other preexisting generative artificial intelligence models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves performance by at least 30 percent in terms of the similarity of the generated image and by 130 percent in terms of  $ROUGE_{recall}$ .},

  abstract={Despite the advancements that have come out of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and subsequent generative AI race, there are a significant number of problems under the surface. With the rise of AI generators in social media and pop culture, these problems amplify as the demand for AI tools skyrockets. These solutions regularly exhibit harmful biases and stereotypes deeply embedded in the data developers use to train AI models. Perhaps exacerbating the immediacy of the issue, generative AI models can create highly realistic imagery, empowering users with malicious intent. This paper explores the pervasive issue of bias in generative AI and its implications. It also examines how these models, often trained on biased datasets, can unintentionally amplify, replicate, and reinforce harmful biases and stereotypes. Additionally, it delves into the objectification of individuals, particularly women, and in a novel study, discusses how a popular TikTok filter that uses generative AI exhibits gender and racial biases while excessively sexualizing its users. While research on AI bias is forthcoming, existing literature referenced throughout this paper underscores its presence across various systems. This paper demonstrates the continued propagation of AI bias as these systems expand and iterate, often with inadequate mitigation efforts. It advocates for ethical considerations, accountability, and transparency in generative AI design and data selection. The Author proposes a novel framework called the Stereotypes, Objectification, Racism, and Datasets (SORD) Framework. The SORD Framework is proposed as a lens to examine the multifaceted dimensions of bias in generative AI. By critically analyzing these components, this paper aims to shed light on the ethical implications of biased generative AI, stimulate thoughtful discussions regarding responsible AI development, and provoke the lengthy process of removing bias from the systems and training datasets to eliminate AI bias at the source. Furthermore, it calls for collaboration among developers, researchers, and engineers to advance research, mitigate biases, and promote algorithmic fairness using the SORD Framework. Future work includes refining the SORD framework and assessing its effectiveness. Lastly, the Author underscores the pivotal role of engineering education in nurturing ethical AI practices, empowering future engineers to address societal challenges stemming from biased datasets and AI systems.},

  abstract={The primary objective of this study was to identify several aspects of entrepreneurship and the role that generative AI technologies play in transforming the field. A researcher has used Likert scale questionnaire to gather primary data from 350 entrepreneurs in order to examine the effect of generative AI on entrepreneurship. The collected data was analysed using percentage analysis and simple linear regression. It was discovered that entrepreneurs' adoption of generative AI has a major impact on the transformation of entrepreneurship. The alternative hypothesis-that generative AI has a major impact on entrepreneurship—is accepted because the “P” value was 0.000, or less than 0.05. This depicts that, the use of generative AI by businesspeople creates revolutionary new avenues for wealth creation, societal influence, and entrepreneurial success.},

  abstract={Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement (SR3) is a state-of-the-art super-resolution algorithm based on diffusion model that can enhance the resolution of images. This method is used to pre-trained models on large datasets and can be used for various tasks without requiring training from scratch. Training SR3 from scratch using the ImageNet dataset involves a complex process that requires substantial computational resources and expertise. The idea is applied the trained SR3 model to new images by feeding the low-resolution inputs and obtaining the high-resolution outputs. It's important to note that training SR3 from scratch is a resource-intensive process that requires powerful GPUs and significant computation time. If you do not have access to such resources, an alternative is to use pre-trained models that are already available and fine-tune them on specific datasets or tasks. The paper shows the result of comparing the resolution of the preprocessed images using a significantly smaller number of images to perform the training with those obtained using the pre-trained model. The results obtained show acceptable results without having to perform on large datasets minimizing the computation time to obtain the resolution of images.},

  abstract={Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used as a vital tool for describing characteristics of information in the process of data mining and patterns. In data mining, an Anomaly Detection (AD) is an essential part which helps to determine behavior within the data and helps to detect network intrusion. The existing AD in network traffic has identified outliers in unbalanced datasets and difficult to train the model. Therefore, this paper introduces Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based on Minimax Loss Function for detecting anomalies in network traffic. Initially, this paper uses Neural Simulation Language-Knowledge Discovery in Databases (NSL-KDD) dataset which contains attacks and are preprocessed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality. After that, these features are processed using the Information Gain (IG) algorithm for eliminating irrelevant features and then anomalies are detected by the proposed GAN-Minimax loss function which effectively identifies outliers, handles imbalanced data and trains the model effectively. The proposed GAN-Minimax resulted in high accuracy as 99.92% when compared with existing K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method.},

Expert knowledge was extracted to develop artificial sand-breaking system. conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) was developed to achieve data augmentation. Computational experiments were implemented to evaluate artificial system performance by predicting whether the system can reach the set age limit. Using fuzzy control, the real sand-breaking system and the artificial one can learn from each other in parallel execution to provide decision support for sand-breaking system management. This approach provides a human–machine hybrid parallel intelligence system for complex sand-breaking systems management.},

  abstract={The Indo-Australian Plate, the Eurasian Plate, and the Pacific Plate all converge where Indonesia is situated. As a result, Indonesia is a nation where earthquakes occur frequently. Some researchers have studied machine learning algorithms for categorizing earthquake vibrations. In this experiment, earthquake vibrations are categorized using the Artificial Neural Network method. We need appropriate datasets to obtain the maximum accuracy from the artificial neural network technique. The findings of this experiment show that feature extraction is required for the datasets to be trained to obtain a high accuracy value. The mean, median, maximum, minimum, skew, and kurtosis values are the feature that are extracted. In addition to employing feature extraction, it is crucial to modify the algorithm model. The experimental setup that uses “sigmoid” activation on the input layer, the three hidden layers, and the output layer yields the best accuracy when all feature are extracted, with training to test ratio of 90% to 10%. This is demonstrated by the exceptional training accuracy and testing accuracy values, which are 99.85 percent for training accuracy and 99.12 percent for validation accuracy. The mean value yields the highest accuracy result compared to employing just one feature extraction. Only 90.97 and 90.37 percent of training and validation accuracy are obtained when the mean is used alone for feature extraction.},

This study investigates the creation of AI agents that integrate state-of-the-art capabilities for decision-making and natural language interaction. Drawing on the fundamental concepts of AI agents, this research endeavors to enhance their functionality by seamlessly incorporating real-time Internet data into decision-making processes and implementing contextually aware conversation systems. The proposed AI agents were designed as independent entities capable of learning from data, making decisions, and executing actions without the need for direct human intervention.

  abstract={In an era where technology plays a significant role in the lives of people of all ages, adapting to rapidly advancing technology is essential. Lifelong learning, which integrates formal, non-formal, and informal education, helps learners develop skills and abilities independently. Programming skills serve as an example of lifelong learning, requiring the development of technical skills such as programming, planning, and testing, as well as communication, teamwork, and systematic thinking. This research focuses on utilizing Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) to enhance programming skills through self-directed learning combined with interactive learning. The study was conducted with 21 students enrolled in the Higher Vocational Certificate (Diploma) program in Mechatronics and Robotics. The study applied the MAR model, which consists of three stages: The motivation stage, is designed to encourage learners to engage in activities that link prior knowledge or experiences with new knowledge, thereby fostering self-directed learning motivation, such as designing personalized learning activities based on individual interests; the Activity stage, which provides opportunities for learners to use Generative AI technology for self-directed learning according to their goals and plans, enabling them to understand concepts, apply knowledge in various situations, and track their learning progress; and the Reflection and Progress stage, focusing on reviewing, analyzing, and reflecting on learning outcomes, as well as exchanging ideas and skills with peers and receiving constructive feedback. These stages were designed based on theoretical foundations and a literature review. Furthermore, the research emphasized ethical considerations in AI use, such as data privacy and societal impacts, to promote high-quality, beneficial lifelong learning. The findings showed that before the learning process, the learner had no background in programming and had never used AI technology. However, after participating in the learning activities, students became more open to learning and responded positively to the self-designed activities, which aligned with their interests and skills related to their field of study. These findings suggest that this learning process, when implemented effectively, can be applied to lifelong learning for individuals of all genders and ages.},

  abstract={Formative assessment can be a powerful approach in influencing student mathematical motivation, and the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers more possibilities to do so, especially when using feedback for formative assessment. Nonetheless, the literature review of this study found limited development and research on investigating the impact of using generative AI-based formative feedback on student mathematical motivation. Therefore, this study examined the impact of implementing Class Optimization Master, generative AI-based formative feedback software, in promoting student mathematical motivation. The study employed a case study on fourth-grade students in a primary school in China. Semi-structured interviews with 21 students and two teachers were conducted face-to-face. Then, the interview data were analyzed by thematic analysis based on the three-dimensions theoretical framework of Mathematical Motivation Scale: Beliefs, Engagement, and Attitude. This study found that the use of AI-generated formative feedback enhanced student mathematical motivation by (1) boosting confidence, promoting socio-emotional interaction, and raising the importance of mathematics; (2) rewarding and inspiring a preference for mathematics; and (3) stimulating interest and mental-physical effort. These results provide insights for educators to design how to make use of AI-generated formative feedback to promote mathematical learning. It nonetheless calls for more research using quantitative methods and from different perspectives on this topic.},

Conducted among high school students in Canada, the research assesses how GAI prompt frameworks significantly affect the quality of students’ analytical responses. Results showed significant improvements in all five aspects of readability, accuracy, completeness, logicality, and critical thinking, especially for students with no prior knowledge of the topic. However, enhancements in completeness and critical thinking were less pronounced, suggesting that while the ChatGPT framework substantially supports basic analytical skills, its effectiveness varies depending on the complexity of cognitive tasks and the extent of students’ existing knowledge. The study underscores the significant role that advanced GAI tools can play in modern educational environments, promoting deeper engagement with learning materials and enhancing students’ analytical abilities.

  abstract={Generative AI is a new and rapidly developing field of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new data or content. Although the concept of generating content was invented long back, the latest breakthroughs in neural network architectures have made it possible to implement this concept at a much faster pace. With the availability of vast amounts of data and computational power, it has become increasingly feasible. Generative models aim to generate new data resembling the training data distribution by learning its underlying patterns. They capture the inherent complexity of the data to produce outputs similar to the training examples. Discriminative models, on the other hand, focus on learning boundaries between different classes or categories within the data. The maritime industry is a major contributor to the global economy, but it is also a high-risk industry, as it is exposed to a variety of hazards. Generative AI can be used to improve maritime safety and efficiency in several ways. Although the maritime industry is still in the early stages of adopting generative AI, the potential benefits are significant. The integration of generative AI into maritime operations plays an increasingly important role in the maritime industry. In this view, this paper discusses generative AI, its technology, various applications, and key challenges and research prospectives.},

  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={Web Scraping involves the use of bots for the purpose of extracting data from the online web. To extract such data, the web scraper must conduct at least 3 different steps, i.e., collect the necessary links from the web, extract data using the provided links, and save the information in a neatly organized CSV file or database. However, traditional methods to accomplish these steps have faced many difficulties, such as anti-scraping measures and website changes. To tackle these difficulties and to accomplish the steps in a more rapid yet advanced way, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be utilized. As of mid-2024, the rapid development and improvement of AI has resulted in its integration into many businesses and educational institutions. The current state of AI is remarkably advanced that it can be integrated in about any field and sector available. In this paper, the researcher defined the term Web Scraping, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning, explained the use of AI in Web Scraping including its importance and potential, and the understanding of ethical web scraping practices. This literature review indicated that the integrated use of AI improves the performance of Web Scraping compared to traditional methods.},

  abstract={In the evolving landscape of educational technology, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into educational assessment creation has emerged as a key area of innovation. This paper compares three methods for generating Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs): (1) without the use of generative AI, (2) with unguided usage of ChatGPT, and (3) with a specialized AI-powered micro-app designed specifically for MCQ generation. The micro-app, named the "MCQ Generator", allows users to set preferences such as difficulty level, number of distractors, and inclusion of hints/feedback, tailoring the final prompt based on these selections. Our study involves instructional designers creating MCQs for hypothetical courses, with educators then evaluating the quality of these questions using a rubric-based approach. The results reveal that AI-assisted methods significantly enhance the efficiency and quality of MCQ generation compared to non-AI methods. Notably, the micro-app demonstrates potential advantages over ChatGPT, offering a more user-friendly interface and a lower barrier to entry for educators. These findings suggest that while ChatGPT can enhance the MCQ creation process, AI micro-apps may provide more tailored functionalities that further streamline educators’ workflows. This paper presents empirical evidence on the utility of AI in educational content development. By doing so, it contributes to the broader discourse on the transformative potential of AI in educational assessment, with a particular focus on online education. Additionally, it explores methods to increase AI adoption within the field.},

  abstract={The development of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI tools, has significantly transformed higher education. This study examined the key challenges encountered by college lecturers in the AI environment and the practical solutions they offered for these challenges. Seventeen heads of departments or academic units from a teacher education college participated in this study. Data were collected through a video-recorded focus group interview and supplemented reports. Data were analyzed inductively using the constant comparison method to identify recurring themes and patterns across the participants. The findings revealed five central challenges faced by college lecturers: (1) Assessment integrity that includes difficulties in verifying student authenticity, increasing plagiarism risks, and diminishing academic originality; (2) AI adoption resistance characterized by reluctance or hesitancy in embracing AI technologies stemming from limited familiarity and a lack of confidence; (3) Pedagogical adaptation imperative that necessitates the revision of instructional methodologies and a redefinition of the lecturer's role in the context of AI integration; (4) Technological literacy disparities that refer to gaps in digital literacy among both faculty and students, compound by unequal familiarity with AI tools; and (5) Limited institutional resources that result in restricted access to advanced AI tools and insufficient professional development opportunities. In response to these challenges, the participants proposed several potential solutions: fostering transparent and ethical student utilization of AI tools, implementing alternative assessment strategies focused on personal and critical thinking skills, enhancing institutional support through ICT centers, offering structured training programs, and ensuring equitable access to AI platforms. So, colleges need to open dialogue and collaboration among faculty members to develop shared guidelines and best practices for the ethical and effective use of AI in academic settings. In addition, teaching should focus more on thinking critically and personal skills, which are especially essential in the AI environment.},

  abstract={The increasing use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in learning contexts calls for a reassessment of the complex dynamics surrounding academic integrity. It is a “hot” topic in the academic community, given that these more generative AI tools have become available to students to complete student assignments, and universities have had to urgently adopt rules on their use for academic purposes. While some universities have completely banned the use of such programs for the purpose of writing assignments and essays because they believe that this violates academic integrity, some other universities believe that they have the potential to influence the way we learn and approach education and that generative AI tools they must use for the benefit of students and faculty staff. The aim of the study conducted at the universities of Vern and Algebra in Zagreb, in the winter semester academic year 2023/2024 was to investigate whether students use generative AI tools for writing assignments and academic papers, how they perceive academic integrity in relation to the use of generative AI tools, and the advantages and disadvantages of generative artificial intelligence tools.},

  abstract={Summary <p>There are two broad classes in AI: generative AI and discriminative AI. Machine learning (ML), a part of AI, learns from data. Deep learning (DL), a deeper part of ML, uses layered setups to solve tougher problems. Discriminative AI focuses on algorithms that learn to tell apart different data classes. Looking at existing applications, discriminative AI generally has five main tasks: classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and reinforcement learning. Generative AI has the ability to generate all kinds of data and content. By learning the patterns and characteristics of given datasets, generative AI models can create new data samples that are similar to the original data. Generally speaking, generative AI models can perform three tasks: data generation, data transformation, and data enrichment. Large language models are at the forefront of generative AI applications, with widespread impacts across various industries.</p>},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={338-343},
  abstract={Fusion design is an innovative design approach in product color design. The fusion design makes the color matching richer. It not only can be simultaneously with a variety of styles but also fully express the design concept. However, the manual completion of the fusion design process takes time and effort. With the development of artificial intelligence, some designers apply intelligent algorithms to fusion design and significantly improve design efficiency. However, most design methods only achieve style migration from the source domain product style to the target domain product in one direction, leading to the resulting design solution losing some of the style information of the target domain product. We propose a color-style fusion design method based on generative adversarial networks. Take the eyeshadow color design as an example. Firstly, the source domain art painting dataset and the target domain eyeshadow dataset are collected, and the CycleGAN extracts the color styles of both to fuse to generate an eyeshadow color scheme with artistic style. The experimental results show that the proposed method can meet the color design concept of color cosmetics and retain the original art painting color style, providing a reference for designers and a new idea for product fusion design.},

  year={2025},

  pages={1-17},
  abstract={Recent advances in diffusion models have opened new avenues for research into embodied AI agents and robotics. Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation–a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation–remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2 Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2 Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2 Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.

  abstract={The combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity technologies speeds up the digital payment system advancements. Real-time transaction processing demands must meet with unyielding protection of financial security standards throughout present financial markets. For computerized monetary systems to identify scams, forecast user actions, and evaluate risk, they are integrating artificial intelligence, deep learning, and the processing of natural languages. These security systems receive additional protection from cyber threats through advanced mechanisms which include zero-trust architectures, biometric encryption as well as AI-powered intrusion detection systems. This study describes the impact of integrating AI technologies with cybersecurity solutions upon typical digital payment systems which now function as more secure and efficient infrastructure. The hybrid AI-cloud system recommends an intelligence-driven method to analyze transaction information which enables the detection of abnormal behavior along with automatic security interventions. Online payment methods are made more reliable and accurate by integrating artificial intelligence (AI), statistical analysis of behavior, and protected chain technologies into the architecture. The evaluation based on genuine payment transaction data reveals better fraud identification results with enhanced accuracy and all four-detection metrics (precision, recall and F1-score included). Security solutions incorporating intelligent technology demonstrate their necessity for defending future financial transactions according to research evidence. The proposed system leads all competing methods in detection accuracy by reaching 94.6% at maximum while demonstrating effective performance in digital payment contexts.},

  abstract={This study investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated personalized images to address the underrepresentation of female students in university engineering programs and promote gender equality in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Persistent gender disparities in STEM present significant barriers to diversity and innovation, highlighting the need for innovative strategies to inspire underrepresented groups. The research involved 76 high school students from scientific tracks, who were shown with AI-generated personalized images portraying themselves working in STEM-related professions. Results indicate that self-envisioning in STEM fields increased for both genders after the intervention, with the effect being four times greater for female students. In engineering fields specifically, a significant increase in selfenvisioning was observed among female students, while no significant impact was found for male students-likely due to the historical underrepresentation of women and the influence of gender stereotypes on career aspirations. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI-generated personalized images as a novel tool to reduce gender disparities in STEM. Integrating such an approach into career counseling could enhance participation and foster diversity in STEM disciplines.},

This paper presents CAS-GAN, a novel GAN framework that serves as a “virtual contrast agent” to synthesize X-ray angiographies via disentanglement representation learning and vessel semantic guidance, thereby reducing the reliance on iodinated contrast agents during interventional procedures. Specifically, our approach disentangles X-ray angiographies into background and vessel components, leveraging medical prior knowledge. A specialized predictor then learns to map the interrelationships between these components. Additionally, a vessel semantic-guided generator and a corresponding loss function are introduced to enhance the visual fidelity of generated images.

  abstract={The motivation of this paper is to be able to generate high-quality (Structured Query Language) SQL language sentences in terms of syntax and semantics so that they are intended to achieve a concrete predefined and well-known aim. For example, generating SQL sentences that are capable of detecting a cyber-attack from a set of metrics available in a database table. Two solutions are needed to achieve so, a tool that enables and performs the syntactically valid generation of SQL sentences and an (Artificial intelligence) AI algorithm able to guide the semantics of such generations to the achievement of the best sentences for the intended purpose. The main contribution of this manuscript is the first of these solutions. To be concrete, this paper proposes a tool to enable and generate syntactic-valid language sentences. The tool can deal with any language defined as an ANTLR4 EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) grammar. The paper also provides a methodology to help achieve an EBNF grammar suitable for addressing concerns related to ambiguity and recursion as a direct result of the generation process. The paper further implements a prototype utilizing ANTLR4’s recognizer and its Augmented Transition Network for language generation using EBNF grammars. In-depth design and logic implementation are provided, showcasing areas of interest for AI integration. The achieved prototype showed an ability to easily generate syntactically valid SQL statements at various depths, with observable problems becoming more apparent during the exponential recursive growth. Our mitigation controls for such scenarios proved to be successful and were able to complete the recursion whilst also moving the push-down automata forward until query completion. Experimental validation was performed against a SQL EBNF grammar feeding the generated SQL statement into an SQL parser to validate the syntax.},

  abstract={In Recent years, Representation learning as one of the information extraction and data mapping methods in machine learning systems has received huge attention. Artificial deep neural networks are considered as one of the basic structures capable of representation learning. However, a large number of standard representation learning methods are supervised and requires a lot of labeled data. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised representation learning by designing and implementing deep neural networks (DNNs) in combination with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The main idea behind the proposed method, which causes the superiority of this method over others is representation learning via the generative models and encoder networks altogether. In this research, encoders are utilized in addition to the generative models to help the more features to be extracted. It is shown that the proposed method not only help feature extraction but accelerate and improve the performance of the learning in GANs which lead to better feature extraction. The results confirm the superiority of the proposed approach regarding classification accuracy by 2% to 6% improvement over other unsupervised feature learning methods.},

  abstract={We are in a golden age of progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Radiotherapy is perfectly suited to benefit from AI to enhance accuracy and efficiency due to its technology-intensive nature and direct human–machine interactions. While large amount of AI research have recently been published in the field of photon therapy, applications of AI specifically targeted for particle therapy remain scarcely investigated. There are two distinct differences between the photon therapy and particle therapy: 1) beam interaction physics (photons versus charged particles) and 2) beam delivery mode (e.g., IMRT/VMAT versus pencil beam scanning). Consequently, different strategies of AI deployment are required for these two radiotherapy modalities. In this article, we aim to present a comprehensive survey of recent literature exclusively focusing on AI-powered particle therapy. Six major aspects are included: 1) treatment planning; 2) dose calculation; 3) range and dose verification; 4) image guidance; 5) quality assurance; and 6) adaptive replanning. A number of perspectives, as well as potential challenges and common pitfalls, are also discussed.},

  abstract={The purpose of this research paper is to investigate the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools into Australian higher education. This study will emphasise the advantages, disadvantages, and ethical repercussions of adopting an "AI-first mindset." This mindset delves into students and faculty, encouraging the use of AI tools for academic research, assessments, and support in educational settings. With the rising use of AI technology by educational institutions to improve learning outcomes, providing personalised student experience and streamline administrative procedures. It is becoming increasingly important to evaluate both the potential benefits and the inherent problems associated with the advent of AI. This research adopts a mixed-methods approach, with quantitative surveys of educators and students used along with qualitative interviews from other stakeholders in the tech industry. The research findings indicate that even though AI tools can improve engagement and efficiency, issues around data privacy, the digital gap, and the possibility of AI bias exist in algorithms. A critical analysis is also performed on the ethical considerations surrounding academic integrity and educators' role in an environment enhanced by artificial intelligence. At the end of the article, recommendations are made for legislative frameworks and best practices that will lead to the appropriate integration of artificial intelligence in higher education. These recommendations will ensure that the advantages are maximised while mitigating the dangers connected with the integration. This research contributes to the changing environment of higher education in the digital era and gives insights to institutions striving to create an ethical and inclusive approach to AI deployment.},

  abstract={The past few years have experienced significant strides in the development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in high-quality image generation. This paper provides a detailed review about the most prominent GAN models that have shaped the development of more realistic synthetic images. The aim of this paper is to help researchers review the most significant advancements and gain insights regarding their basics, working, limitations and future scope. The major driving force for the rapid development of GANs is the extensive work done to solve training instability, mode collapse, and visual artifact issues. These issues make training a GAN a difficult process. To address this concern, we chose six pioneering models for in-depth analysis—StyleGAN, StyleGAN-XL, StarGAN, Slicing Adversarial Network (SAN), Diffusion GAN, GigaGAN. These models shattered previous record FID scores and results in unprecedented image generation performance, fundamentally shifting the benchmark of excellence in the field. They have shown to leverage new architectures that advance the state of generative AI. We emphasize their performance regarding the accuracy, variance, and realism of images, as well as the potential impact of these technologies on diverse fields from medical imaging to deepfake detection, object recognition, image editing, and material science. We extend our review by providing a model idea that could help generate finer emotion conditioned images inspired by StarGAN-XL and StyleGAN architecture.},

  abstract={Text-to-Image Synthesis has gained significant attention due to its ability to generate realistic visuals from textual descriptions. Existing methods, such as Attention-based GAN s and Transformer models, often face challenges in maintaining semantic alignment between text and images, handling complex textual inputs, and ensuring high-quality outputs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DC-GAN) framework leveraging GloVe embeddings for semantic representation. The Oxford 102 Flower dataset, comprising image-text pairs, is used to train and evaluate the model. The DC-GAN architecture includes a generator to synthesize images and a discriminator to validate authenticity, enabling iterative improvement. Evaluation metrics show an average Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) score of 0.286 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1.455, demonstrating semantic coherence and low pixel-level deviations. Challenges such as refining fine-grained image details and enhancing robustness across diverse datasets persist. This study highlights the potential of DC-GAN for multimodal AI applications, including targeted advertising, virtual reality, and creative design. By advancing text-to-image synthesis, the research provides a robust framework for future exploration in generating semantically consistent and high-quality visuals from text.},

In the past six to seven years, the amount of computing power used by record-breaking AI models doubled frequently in the time span of months. An interesting way in which these models learn and progress is through deep learning. Deep learning is an intelligent machine’s way in which machines learn without being supervised by us and grants them the power to recognize speech, translate, and even make or take data-driven decisions. Machines consider this as a studying method, inspired by the architecture of the human brain and how we learn. An important deep learning method where we train the machines on information that is unlabeled is called unsupervised learning. A strong part of neural networks that are utilized for unsupervised learning is Generative Adversarial Networks. When it comes to applications on images quality improvement, Super Resolution GAN (SRGAN) have a key role to play in it. It was proposed by researchers at Twitter. The motive of this GAN is to super resolute the fine textures of the image by upscaling it. In order to enhance the images further, ESRGAN is used.

  abstract={The degradation of color in historical paintings poses a significant challenge to art preservation, diminishing the vibrancy and authenticity of masterpieces over time. This paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize color restoration in historical artworks. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), AI systems can analyze faded paintings and reconstruct their original hues with unprecedented precision. Using large datasets of high-resolution images, these algorithms learn patterns of pigment degradation and stylistic nuances inherent to specific artists or periods. The study highlights how AI models, trained on multispectral and hyperspectral imaging data, can infer the original color schemes by detecting remnants of pigments invisible to the naked eye. Moreover, AI-driven simulations offer insights into artistic intent and historical contexts, enabling restorers to make informed decisions. This interdisciplinary approach merges art history, chemistry, and computer science, fostering a new era of cultural heritage preservation. The findings underscore AI's transformative role in safeguarding the visual integrity of humanity's artistic legacy while maintaining the ethical considerations of artistic authenticity and conservation standards.},

  abstract={The corporate bankruptcy prediction problem remains unresolved, primarily due to the significant class imbalance caused by the rarity of bankruptcy cases in most financial markets. This study addresses the class imbalance challenge using generative artificial intelligence (GAI), employing a conditional generative adversarial network (CTGAN) to generate synthetic data for training machine learning models. Following data augmentation, six representative machine learning models, including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost, XGBoost, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and LightGBM, are evaluated and compared using two real-world datasets from Taiwan and the USA. The CTGAN-based synthetic data generation approach is further compared with alternative methods, including the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Gaussian copula data generators. Experimental results demonstrate that the workflow combining CTGAN and LightGBM achieves the highest prediction performance, measured by F1 score, on both datasets. It also outperforms baseline methods from previous studies, highlighting the effectiveness of GAI in addressing the class imbalance problem in corporate bankruptcy prediction.},

  number={},
  pages={1224-1228},
  abstract={This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning approach, named GARL (Generative Adversarial Reinforcement Learning), for intra-day optimization dispatch in high-proportion new energy grid. The proposed method embeds a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) within the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) framework to learn the reward distribution of the power grid in the future operation situation, so as to realize the cumulative reward prediction in the dispatching period and ensure the optimization of the dispatching decision. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the SG-126 power grid simulator under three representative scenarios to evaluate the performance and generalization capability of GARL. The results show that GARL can learn the distribution characteristics of stateaction-reward sequence from historical experience, establish the mapping relationship between current state and future cumulative reward, and improve the accuracy of future power grid operation trend prediction, which is always better than the independent DDPG algorithm. Furthermore, the study explores the potential of transfer learning between scenarios and finds that GARL exhibits a promising generalization capability.},

  volume={13},

  pages={18366-18385},
  abstract={This study investigates factors influencing the acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) in education, focusing on attitudes and intentions toward its use. Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Social Support Theory (SST), the research examines perceived usefulness, ease of use, and support measures, including educational and emotional support. The study was conducted at King Saud University, where it adopted a quantitative approach, collecting data from 350 participants through a structured survey. A final sample of 308 valid responses was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings revealed significant relationships between key constructs: perceived educational support positively influenced perceived usefulness ( $\beta = 0.160$ , p = 0.000) and attitudes toward AI ( $\beta = 0.140$ , p = 0.010). Perceived usefulness ( $\beta = 0.670$ , p = 0.000) and ease of use ( $\beta = 0.330$ , p = 0.000) were strong predictors of positive attitudes, which, in turn, significantly shaped intentions to use AI ( $\beta = 0.760$ , p = 0.000). Emotional support and cognitive support also had notable but mixed effects on perceived usefulness. However, social interaction support and perceived enjoyment did not demonstrate significant influence. These findings highlight the importance of designing AI systems that emphasise usability and provide robust educational and emotional support to enhance acceptance. The study contributes to theory by extending TAM with constructs from SST, offering new insights into AI adoption in academic contexts. Practically, the results guide policymakers and developers in fostering AI acceptance by addressing educational and emotional needs, ensuring effective implementation in higher education.},

  abstract={Data augmentation is a widespread innovative technique in Artificial Intelligence: it aims at creating new synthetic data given an existing real baseline, thus allowing to overcome the issues arising from the lack of labelled data for proper training of classification algorithms. Our paper focuses on how a common data augmentation methodology, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which is widespread for images and timeseries data, can be also applied to generate multivariate data. We propose a novel scheme for GANs evaluation, based on the performance of an explainable AI (XAI) algorithm and an innovative definition of rule similarity. In particular, we will consider an application dealing with the augmentation of Inertial Movement Units (IMU) data for physical fatigue monitoring in two age subgroups (under and over 40 years old) of the original data. We will show how our innovative rule similarity metric can drive the selection of the best fake dataset among a set of different candidates, corresponding to different GAN training runs.},

  title={The Responsible Development of Automated Student Feedback with Generative AI}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-10},
  abstract={Providing rich, constructive feedback to students is essential for supporting and enhancing their learning. Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly with large language models (LLMs), present new opportunities to deliver scalable, repeatable, and instant feedback, effectively making abundant a resource that has historically been scarce and costly. From a technical perspective, this approach is now feasible due to breakthroughs in AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP). While the potential educational benefits are compelling, implementing these technologies also introduces a host of ethical considerations that must be thoughtfully addressed. One of the core advantages of AI systems is their ability to automate routine and mundane tasks, potentially freeing up human educators for more nuanced work. However, the ease of automation risks a “tyranny of the majority”, where the diverse needs of minority or unique learners are overlooked, as they may be harder to systematize and less straightforward to accommodate. Ensuring inclusivity and equity in AI-generated feedback, therefore, becomes a critical aspect of responsible AI implementation in education. The process of developing machine learning models that produce valuable, personalized, and authentic feedback also requires significant input from human domain experts. Decisions around whose expertise is incorporated, how it is captured, and when it is applied have profound implications for the relevance and quality of the resulting feedback. Additionally, the maintenance and continuous refinement of these models are necessary to adapt feedback to evolving contextual, theoretical, and student-related factors. Without ongoing adaptation, feedback risks becoming obsolete or mismatched with the current needs of diverse student populations. Addressing these challenges is essential not only for ethical integrity but also for building the operational trust needed to integrate AI-driven systems as valuable tools in contemporary education. Thoughtful planning and deliberate choices are needed to ensure that these solutions truly benefit all students, allowing AI to support an inclusive and dynamic learning environment.},
