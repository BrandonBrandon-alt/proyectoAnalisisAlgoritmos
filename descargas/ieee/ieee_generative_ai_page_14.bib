  abstract={Nowadays, generative models with deep learning have a focus and give enormous success in various real-time experience domains. Deep learning (DL) is a subdivision of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of human brain activity, known as artificial neural networks. It is a data-driven technique that achieves the best accuracy while using a large number of input samples. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a robust class of neural networks used for unsupervised learning under DL categories. GAN is one of the most influential architectures demonstrating remarkable success in generating high-quality data. The reusable feature learning process from a huge number of unlabelled data paves the way for research. This survey article discusses an overview of the GAN model, such as the original GAN, Conditional GANs, and resolution GANs, along with their specific adaptations for various tasks. Additionally, we examine the situations faced by Generative Adversarial Networks depending on various applications such as image and video generation, medical image analysis, text-to-image synthesis, agriculture, and creative industries such as music and art. This survey explores diverse applications of recently developed frameworks and benchmark datasets used for development, along with their architecture and metric evaluations.},

  abstract={With the advent of the intelligent era, people have begun to explore how to use AI technology to create animation. This paper introduces the application of three AI tools, Stable Diffusion (SD), Volcano Engine (VE) and Runway (RW), in animation creation, and explores how these tools can improve the efficiency of creation, enrich the creative expression and reduce production costs. It has been found that the AI-driven animation production process can assist humans in automating the process, speeding up the production of works, maintaining artistic expression to a certain extent, and providing new ideas for creating animation. However, with the popularity of AI technology comes some potential risks and challenges, including content homogenization, technology misuse and copyright attribution. By analyzing examples of current AI practices in animation production, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the practical application of AI technology in animation creation. It presents preliminary suggestions for addressing these risks. The results show that although AI technology is driving animation creation in the direction of greater diversity and individualization, its widespread application requires careful consideration and planning at both the technical and ethical levels, so as to avoid and resolve the risky issues it may raise.},

  pages={626-631},
  abstract={Recently, with increasing interest in pet healthcare, the demand for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems in veterinary medicine has increased. The development of veterinary CAD has stagnated due to a lack of sufficient radiology data. To overcome the challenge, we propose a generative active learning framework based on a variational autoencoder. This approach aims to alleviate the scarcity of reliable data for CAD systems in veterinary medicine. This study utilizes datasets comprising cardiomegaly radiographic image data and chronic kidney disease ultrasound image data. After removing annotations and standardizing images, we employed a framework for data augmentation, which consists of a data generation phase and a query phase for filtering the generated data. The experimental results revealed that as the data generated through this framework was added to the training data of the generative model, the frechet inception distance decreased from 84.14 to 50.75 in the radiographic image and from 127.98 to 35.16 in an ultrasound image. Subsequently, when the generated data were incorporated into the training of the classification model, the true negative of the confusion matrix also improved from 0.16 to 0.66 on the radiograph and from 0.44 to 0.64 on the ultrasound image. The proposed framework has the potential to address the challenges of data scarcity in medical CAD, contributing to its advancement.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Protein subcellular localization (PSCL) prediction is a key research area in bioinformatics. However, most existing models have ignored the homology and diversity among protein sequences, which can reveal the functional sequence segments and indirectly reflect the structure of the protein. Consequently, the achieved performance is limited. To break through this limitation, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model for PSCL prediction, namely, MSADeepLoc. In this model, the protein features are extracted by a protein language model, the MSA Transformer. The MSA Transformer can learn the evolutionary conservation and variability among protein sequences from extensive multiple sequence alignments, effectively capturing and refining key biological information within the sequence structure. Additionally, we apply a pre-trained Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to solve the data imbalance issue. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed MSADeepLoc outperforms the state-of-the-art models in the task of PSCL prediction.},

  abstract={Traditional teaching methods in Indian schools often lack engaging elements, hindering students’ full comprehension of concepts and fostering a tendency to memorize rather than understand. Existing solutions fail to provide effective visualization-based interactive learning. To address these issues, we propose an interactive application-based solution utilizing generative AI image generation models that can be used by students and teachers. Our application employs interactive story generation, allowing students to prompt creative texts and gain a deeper understanding of concepts. Trained on the school curriculum, this tool facilitates self-study, empowering students to understand complex topics independently. The application extends to classroom use, enabling teachers to incorporate interactive and application-based learning alongside traditional methods. Leveraging Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) and transformer-based models, the system analyses user input, extracts key elements, and creates dynamic story graphs for engaging narrative experiences. The integration of quantum computing enhances the application's capabilities, providing a novel approach to education through dynamic storytelling.In conclusion, the proposed solution seeks to bridge the gap in traditional teaching methods by introducing an innovative and interactive approach to education using Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks. This holistic solution addresses the limitations of current educational practices, offering a transformative learning experience for students and teachers alike.},

  abstract={In order to stabilize the training of generative adversarial networks, several recent works advocate spectral normalization in the discriminator. However, the method ignores the influence of the generator, and the quality of the images generated in practice is unstable. We propose L2 norm regularization in the generator based on the spectral normalization, which can solve the above shortcomings. Our method directly makes the generated data close to real data in Euclidean space, and indirectly helps the spectral normalization achieve tighter Lipschitz constraint during the training of generative adversarial networks. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 dataset confirm that our method can not only stable the quality of the images generated by spectral normalization, but also improve the quality of generated images.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) utilizes existing data to create new forms of content, including text, images, and audio. One valuable application of generative AI in an IT Enabled Services (ITES) company is the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) by processing and consolidating existing SOPs through a Large Language Model. This paper explores how generative AI can generate content within standardized templates, improve the language of SOPs, and make them suitable for specific industries and processes, such as the pharmaceutical procure-to-pay process. It also addresses version control, helps users maintain consistency and compliance, extracts knowledge for onboarding, and provides interactive training on SOPs through Questions and Answers. The proposed workflow employs Azure OpenAI's GPT-3.5 turbo for generating responses, which are evaluated using Tonic Validate Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) metrics. Furthermore, the paper introduces Prompt Compression approaches and selects one prompt compression approach to streamline the context retrieved for large language models while preserving the semantic meaning of the outputs. It also details strategies for reducing API call costs by over 10% for prompts of varying token sizes, ensuring high-quality responses from the GPT-3.5 turbo model according to RAG metrics. These criteria of accuracy, precision and cost reduction are considered to recommend the prompt compression approach for Large Language Models used in development of Standard Operating Procedures.},

  abstract={The ocean contains many resources that are vital to the sustainable development of human society. Underwater images provide an important way for people to understand the underwater environment of the ocean. However, due to the uneven medium in water and the scattering effects of light, underwater images usually suffer from some severe degradation problems, such as color distortion and blurring. As such, underwater image enhancement is a very important and critical task in detection of underwater marine objects. To circumvent these problems, a novel generative adversarial network for underwater image enhancement is proposed. In the proposed method, the generator makes use of U-Net network structure and combines CBAM and ASPP to ensure effectiveness of multi-scale feature extraction. The discriminator employs a double-branch structure to guide the generator to generate images from global semantics to local details and enhance local details of the images. Finally, in the quantitative and qualitative analysis, the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods. Comparative studies demonstrate that our proposed method is better than other methods.},

  abstract={Facial recognition system in computer vision is widely used in human-computer interface and clinical diagnostics. Nonetheless, achieving high accuracy in this task still poses a challenge due to issues of inadequate amount and imbalance of data to train the models as well as issues of generalization and robustness. The findings of this research propose the use of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) data augmentation for face emotion classification specifically for this approach. The proposed strategy is based on the generation of artificial ‘emotional’ images on the face using Deep Neural Self Attention GANs (DNSAGANs). This way, to capture all the variations of facial expressions the GAN takes a large number of images and thus makes the augmented data richer and more realistic. This larger data set is then used to train a deep learning architecture that performs the face emotion classification thereby enabling the network to learn enhanced discriminative features. To collect face photos the FER2013 dataset is used. The training process, entrained the generator and discriminator to minimize the mean squared error while the discriminator was simultaneously trained to robustly distinguish generated images from real ones. Altogether, the proposed Adam optimizer was more accurate than Adagrad and Adadelta for all epochs. The percentage of accuracy is about $88.64 \%$ for 100 epochs using the proposed optimizer techniques.},

  pages={589-594},
  abstract={Architectural design is a multifaceted process that traditionally requires extensive time and expertise, often leading to inefficiencies and prolonged project timelines. This study explores the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically an optimized CycleGAN, to address these challenges by integrating architectural style transfer and classification into a single, end-to-end model. The model is trained on a diverse dataset comprising modern and traditional architectural styles, enabling it to transform modern architectural images into traditional styles while simultaneously categorizing the architectural style of each input. The results indicate that the model effectively generates traditional architectural styles from modern inputs, capturing key stylistic elements such as texture and form. However, the classification module reveals an imbalance in performance, with higher accuracy and lower loss for traditional style compared to modern style, suggesting areas for improvement. The findings underscore the potential of AI in revolutionizing architectural design, offering a more efficient, accurate, and streamlined process that can significantly enhance the precision and speed of architectural projects. This study contributes to the growing body of research on AI in architecture, demonstrating its applicability in real-world design scenarios.},

  abstract={Kuwait's rapid urban expansion, driven by large-scale projects, such as AI-Mutlaa City and Silk City, highlights the need for comprehensive geotechnical data to support sustainable development. However, detailed studies on the subsurface geotechnical characteristics of the northern regions of Kuwait are lacking. This study focuses on establishing a preliminary geotechnical database, addressing challenges encountered during its development, and conducting a pilot analysis for AI-Mutlaa City. A questionnaire was distributed to geology, environmental, geotechnical, and engineering professionals to identify the challenges associated with creating the database. The survey revealed issues such as inconsistent data formats, limited access to borehole logs, and the hesitancy of private firms to share data due to security concerns. Despite these challenges, borehole data from ministries and private organizations were collected and organized using Microsoft Excel. These data formed the foundation of the geotechnical database, which was analyzed and visualized using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. The pilot study in AI-Mutlaa City revealed predominantly dense soil layers, with significant variations in soil strength at a depth of 19.5 m, where standard penetration resistance ranged from 10 to 50 blows. These findings emphasize the variability of soil properties in the area and underscore the importance of site-specific investigations. The established geotechnical database provides valuable insights for construction planning, risk assessment, and geohazard management. Moving forward, the integration of artificial intelligence into the database is planned to enhance data processing, automate soil classification, and predict subsurface conditions in an effort to contribute to advanced geotechnical practices in Kuwait.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AI) provides changes to higher education, which has attracted widespread attention from researchers and educators. However, the existing research has not comprehensively examined how university teachers perceive the use of generative AI for student assessment and what strategies should be implemented when applying this technology in China. This study employed mixed-method research to explore teachers’ perceptions of student assessment using generative AI. We collected data through interviews and surveys from Chinese universities. Our findings demonstrate that a majority of teachers agreed with the power of AI tools to enhance the overall quality of the evaluation and their work efficiency, since they can alleviate the burden associated with manual grading and offer prompt feedback. University teachers expect to prepare their knowledge and skills for the usage of new technologies through training programs and professional development opportunities. Besides, this study notes some concerns like data security and privacy fairness, biases inherent in AI algorithms, overreliance on automation, and limited critical human thinking. These challenges lead to the need for further explorations to provide holistic feedback and balance the AI assessment approach with human judgment to meet reasonable standards. This study provides a general introduction to AI-assisted assessment transformation in the university setting, and more empirical inquiries on different types, phases, objectives, and strategies of assessment in practices are suggested.},

  year={2024},
  volume={8},
  number={1},
  pages={313-326},
  abstract={The fundus image is often used in clinical diagnosis due to ease and safety of acquisition, but the quality may be affected by environment and onsite operations. As low-quality medical images may lead to misinterpretation in diagnosis and analysis, it is important to improve quality of the improperly-acquired fundus images. Unfortunately, the existing fundus image enhancement methods require task-specific prior knowledge or suffer from insufficient generalization ability. To cope with this issue, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based model is proposed, namely the semi-supervised GAN with anatomical structure preservation (SSGAN-ASP). Specifically, an anatomical structure extraction component is employed in the generator to guide the enhancement process by preserving both retinal and lesion structures, while color information in the fundus image is also preserved. The SSGAN-ASP model is evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art methods for medical image enhancement on three popular datasets. In addition, it is applied in the pre-processing of retinal vessel segmentation and diabetic retinopathy grading tasks to show efficacy in computer-aided diagnosis. Experimental results demonstrate that visual quality of the enhanced image can be improved while better performance in clinical diagnosis is achieved with our proposed model by adopting the anatomical structure extraction component and preserving color information as well.},

  abstract={The integration of smart medical technologies and connected applications into the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is revolutionizing healthcare by optimizing patient connectivity, immediate monitoring, and data mining. However, the openness of IoMT networks exposes these systems to a variety of cyber threats. These attacks jeopardize the protection, availability, and accuracy of sensitive information and associated resources. It is therefore essential to strengthen the security of IoMT infrastructures in the face of these malicious activities. Identifying new attacks in these environments is a major challenge for researchers and industry professionals. This paper analyzes machine learning-based strategies for identifying IoMT intrusions. We conduct a comprehensive examination of existing solutions, focusing on the analytical methodologies employed, the datasets utilized, and the effectiveness of detection performance. In addition, we discuss the challenges and considerations involved in designing high-performance systems capable of detecting cyberattacks targeting the IoMT. Finally, we highlight future prospects for the development of advanced protection mechanisms tailored to connected medical infrastructures.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-11},
  abstract={Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) copes with the distribution and label shifts between the source and target domains simultaneously, performing accurate classification for known classes while identifying unknown class samples in the target domain. Most existing OSDA approaches, depending on the final image feature space of deep models, require manually-tuned thresholds, and may easily misclassify unknown samples as known classes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) could be a remedy. Within an MoE, different experts handle distinct input features, producing unique expert routing patterns for various classes in a routing feature space. As a result, unknown class samples may display different expert routing patterns to known classes. This paper proposes Dual-Space Detection, which exploits the inconsistencies between the image feature space and the routing feature space to detect unknown class samples without any threshold. A Graph Router is further introduced to better make use of the spatial information among the image patches. Experiments on three datasets validated the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.},

  year={2024},

  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The automation of fruit picking using robotic systems is rapidly advancing within precision agriculture, relying heavily on the accurate detection and segmentation of fruit objects through computer vision. This study explores the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create extensive fruit image datasets, concentrating on cherries, bananas, oranges, apples, and pineapples. Five generative models—Stable Diffusion v1.4, Stable Diffusion v1.5, Stable Diffusion v2, Stable Diffusion XL Refiner 1.0, and SDXL Turbo—were employed to generate 1000 images per fruit type, each set against a white background. Thresholding techniques were used to automatically extract fruit boundaries, which were then utilized to train segmentation models. The performance of these models was evaluated based on their accuracy and processing speed. SDXL Turbo consistently delivered the highest accuracy across all fruit types, though it required more processing time per image. Stable Diffusion XL Refiner 1.0 also exhibited strong accuracy but balanced performance differently. In contrast, Stable Diffusion v2 showed significant shortcomings, particularly in producing accurate images for cherries and oranges. This comparative analysis highlights the potential of advanced generative models in enhancing synthetic dataset creation for fruit object detection and segmentation in agricultural robotics. Future research will focus on refining these models to improve accuracy, broaden their applicability to a wider variety of fruits and environments, and optimize the trade-off between image quality and generation speed to meet the practical needs of agricultural automation.},

  abstract={We investigated 12 years DNS query logs of our campus network and identified phenomena of malicious botnet domain generation algorithm (DGA) traffic. DGA-based botnets are difficult to detect using cyber threat intelligence (CTI) systems based on blocklists. Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML)-based CTI systems are required. This study (1) proposed a model to detect DGA-based traffic based on statistical features with datasets comprising 55 DGA families, (2) discussed how CTI can be expanded with computable CTI paradigm, and (3) described how to improve the explainability of the model outputs by blending explainable AI (XAI) and open-source intelligence (OSINT) for trust problems, an antidote for skepticism to the shared models and preventing automation bias. We define the XAI-OSINT blending as aggregations of OSINT for AI/ML model outcome validation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our models (96.3% accuracy). Our random forest model provides better robustness against three state-of-the-art DGA adversarial attacks (CharBot, DeepDGA, MaskDGA) compared with character-based deep learning models (Endgame, CMU, NYU, MIT). We demonstrate the sharing mechanism and confirm that the XAI-OSINT blending improves trust for CTI sharing as evidence to validate our proposed computable CTI paradigm to assist security analysts in security operations centers using an automated, explainable OSINT approach (for second opinion). Therefore, the computable CTI reduces manual intervention in critical cybersecurity decision-making.},

  abstract={Intelligent vehicle technology has made tremendous progress due to Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. Accurate behavior prediction of surrounding traffic actors is essential for the safe and secure navigation of the intelligent vehicle. Minor misbehavior of these vehicles on the busy roads may lead to an accident. Due to this, there is a need for vehicle behavior research work in today’s era. This research article reviews traffic actors’ behavior prediction techniques for intelligent vehicles to perceive, infer, and anticipate other vehicles’ intentions and future actions. It identifies the key strategies and methods for AI, emerging trends, datasets, and ongoing research issues in these fields. As per the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review dedicated to the vehicle behavior study examining existing academic literature published by peer review venues between 2011 and 2021. A systematic review was undertaken to examine these papers, and five primary research questions have been addressed. The findings show that using sophisticated input representation that includes traffic rules and road geometry, artificial intelligence-based solutions applied to behavior prediction of traffic actors for intelligent vehicles have shown promising success, particularly in complex driving scenarios. Finally, the paper summarizes the most widely used approaches in behavior prediction of traffic actors for intelligent vehicles, which the authors believe serves as a foundation for future research in behavior prediction of surrounding traffic actors for secure and accurate intelligent vehicle navigation.},

  abstract={Semantic image inpainting is different from traditional methods. Although traditional image inpainting methods can achieve good results, they ignore the context, which makes the inpainting images look less natural. Semantic image inpainting does better in this aspect. In this paper, we propose a new method about semantic image inpainting by improving the model of Generative Adversarial Networks. The generator of our network model refers to Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Networks and adds spectral normalization to improving unstable training. Then, our network chooses discriminator of Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks which is more concise. After training, the network model is limited to generate image encoding by context loss and prior loss to make it as similar as possible to the missing image encoding. Then, the generated images encoding corresponding to the without missing parts of the real images are obtained. After fusing the generated missing parts with the unmissed parts of the real image, it is the inpainting image. By the comparisons of vision and quantization, it shows that our method can well complete the task of large missing regions.},

  abstract={The use of smartphones, tablets and other portable devices have increased, and so has the use of voice-assisted chatbots such comparable to Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Google's Voice Assistant. As simple as these voice assistants are, they are very helpful in easing users’ day-to-day tasks. Now as the use of artificial intelligence (AI) based chatbots such as ChatGPT, Bard and Microsoft Bing have started to be progressively used more and more to get assistance with increasingly complicated tasks, there is a need for a chatbot that is both artificial intelligence-based and has the option to provide voice assistance. In order to realize this, need we have developed a web application that integrates both, an AI-large language model constructed using the GPT-3.5 Generative Pre-trained Transformer. model and voice assistance. The application takes in an input in the form of audio clip and converts it into text, sends the query to the GPT-3.5 model and receives the response in text form and converts that to an audio clip.},

  title={Assessing AI Models' Spatial Visualization in PSVT:R and Augmented Reality: Towards Enhancing AI's Spatial Intelligence}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Spatial intelligence is important in many fields, such as Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC), Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and Medicine. Understanding three-dimensional (3D) spatial rotations can involve verbal descriptions and visual or interactive examples, illustrating how objects move and change orientation in 3D space. Recent studies show that artificial intelligence (AI) with language and vision capabilities still faces limitations in spatial reasoning. In this paper, we have studied the spatial capabilities of advanced generative AI to understand the rotations of objects in 3D space utilizing its image processing and language processing features. We examined the spatial intelligence of three generative AI models (GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama 3.2) to understand the spatial rotation process with spatial rotation diagrams based on the revised Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualization of Rotations (Revised PSVT:R). Furthermore, we incorporated an added layer of a coordinate system axes on Revised PSVT:R to study the variations in generative AI models' performance. We additionally examined generative AI models' understanding of 3D rotations in Augmented Reality (AR) scene images that visualize spatial rotations of a physical object in 3D space and observed an increased accuracy of generative AI models' understanding of rotations by adding additional textual information depicting the rotation process or mathematical representations of the rotation (e.g., matrices) superimposed on the object. The results indicate that while GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama 3.2 as the main current generative AI model lack the understanding of a spatial rotation process, it has the potential to understand the rotation process with additional information that can be provided by methods such as AR. AR can superimpose textual information or mathematical representations of rotations on spatial transformation diagrams and create a more intelligible input for AI to comprehend or for training AI's spatial intelligence. Furthermore, by combining the potentials in spatial intelligence of AI with AR's interactive visualization abilities, we expect to offer enhanced guidance for students' spatial learning activities. Such spatial guidance can greatly benefit understanding spatial transformations and additionally support processes like assembly, construction, manufacturing, as well as learning in AEC, STEM, and Medicine that require precise 3D spatial understanding.},

  abstract={The influences of emotions, anthropomorphism, cognitive assessments, social influence, and motivation are vital in shaping users' acceptance and usage of artificial intelligence software. The challenge for generative AI software lies in evaluating users' emotions, cognitions, and perceptions. The assessment of factors like performance expectancy, effort expectancy, anthropomorphic traits, intrinsic motivation, social influence, and emotions are crucial to understanding users' readiness to adopt such software. To interpret users' acceptance levels during interactions with generative AI chatbot software, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology Model and Cognitive Appraisal Theory serve as theoretical frameworks. The model was empirically validated using data from an online survey. The analysis of generative AI software acceptance, along with the factors influencing users' willingness to use it, was conducted using PLS-SEM. The results highlighted that emotions are a significant determinant of software acceptance and support the proposed three-tier appraisal model for accepting the use of Generative AI Software.},

  abstract={This article examines the intricate relationship between humans and text-to-image generative models (generative artificial intelligence/genAI) in the realm of art. The article frames that relationship in the theory of mediated action—a well-established theory that conceptualizes how tools shape human thoughts and actions. The article describes genAI systems as learning, cocreating, and communicating, multimodally capable hybrid systems that distill and rely on the wisdom and creativity of massive crowds of people and can sometimes surpass them. Those systems elude the theoretical description of the role of tools and locus of control in mediated action. The article asks how well the theory can accommodate both the transformative potential of genAI tools in creative fields and art, and the ethics of the emergent social dynamics it generates. The article concludes by discussing the fundamental changes and broader implications that genAI brings to the realm of mediated action and, ultimately, to the very fabric of our daily lives.},

  abstract={The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) models is driven and shaped by training data. In industries where data is naturally sparse, AI systems face a significant challenge due to their intensive data needs. Anxieties about underprivileged groups' present and future healthcare AI bias stem from the difficulty of curating training data in the healthcare industry. To reduce reliance on huge data, built an autoencoder to augment and expand intentionally sparse datasets, as detailed in this paper. A computational investigation using publicly available data. Patients' ages ranging from 45 to 75 from Africa, Europe, India, and Bangladesh were included in six open-source datasets. The presented architecture uses actual patient imaging data to create synthetic pictures. For this case study, they utilised an autoencoder to augment existing public datasets of optic disc images for training purposes and assessed how well these datasets could train AI models to identify glaucomatous optic neuropathy. An evaluation of the glaucoma detector's performance was conducted using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Better detection performance is indicated by a higher AUC. The results demonstrate that by supplementing datasets with autoencoder-generated synthetic pictures, better training sets were produced, ultimately leading to enhanced AI model performance. Beyond health care, this study may boost AI adoption in all data-challenged domains, which is a major concern due to the ever-increasing database volume as well as necessary for AI building.},

  abstract={Efficient base station (BS) deployment in dense urban environments requires rapid and accurate coverage evaluation. Traditional ray-tracing, although precise, is too computationally intensive for real-time or large-scale planning. In this paper, we introduce the Base Station Coverage Strength Map (BSCSM), a novel spatial metric that quantifies deployment suitability for each location at full spatial resolution. We propose an end-to-end conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) framework that predicts BSCSM directly from building layout images, eliminating the need for expensive per-location simulations. Compared to conventional U-Net and Pix2Pix baselines, our model achieves inference speeds several orders of magnitude faster than ray-tracing, while maintaining superior TopK hotspot prediction accuracy. The generated BSCSM enable advanced 6G network planning, UAV path optimization, and real-time connectivity assessment, providing a scalable and practical solution for next-generation wireless infrastructure design.},

Existing frameworks, such as AI Guardian, offer valuable defenses but often rely on assumptions that can limit their effectiveness, such as incorporating adversarial examples into training data and expecting attacks to be directional. This paper introduces an innovative approach to adversarial defense that diverges from traditional methods by proposing a defense strategy based on stable diffusion[1], [2]. Our method avoids training with adversarial examples and instead leverages continuous learning and comprehensive threat modeling to build inherently resilient AI systems. By addressing the limitations of existing defenses and emphasizing a dynamic, adaptive strategy, our approach aims to provide a more generalized and robust solution to adversarial threats. We present the theoretical underpinnings, experimental design, and anticipated benefits of our approach, with a focus on enhancing AI security and adaptability against unpredictable adversarial attacks[3], [4].},

  abstract={In recent years, the thriving growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has placed significant focus on deep learning (DL), a pivotal research domain. DL heavily relies on extensive, high-quality data to fuel its model learning and optimization processes, particularly achieving remarkable advancements in classification tasks. However, in practical applications, obtaining labeled data often faces many challenges, leading to limitations in the size of the dataset. When there is insufficient data, DL models are prone to overfitting, which is particularly prominent when dealing with small-scale datasets. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fixed dataset enhancement and classification algorithm based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This method utilizes the generation capability of GAN to generate new and diverse data samples, effectively expanding the size of the original fixed dataset and increasing its diversity. Through this approach, not only can the problem of insufficient data be alleviated, but also the performance of DL classification algorithms can be improved. The experimental results show that by introducing GAN for data augmentation, the performance of classification algorithms has been significantly improved, providing strong support for the promotion and application of DL in practical applications.},

  abstract={This article examines the application of generative artificial intelligence in simulating virtual tourism experiences and its impact on tourist behavior in the postCOVID era. Utilizing advanced technologies such as Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, and WebXR, a system has been designed to create interactive virtual experiences of tourist destinations. A literature review reveals that both virtual experiences and generative AI hold significant potential in the tourism industry. However, few studies have explored how these two technologies can be combined and their impact on tourist behavior. Additionally, considering that generative AI, as a tool for simulating tourism experiences, significantly influences tourists' perception of destinations and attractions, travel intention, travel anxiety, and willingness to pay, studying generative AI and virtual tourism seems essential and important. Therefore, this study aims to review previous research and explore the impact of AI-based virtual tourism experiences on tourist behavior in the post-COVID era. Moreover, the study investigates factors influencing the effectiveness of these experiences and the moderating role of safety and health concerns. Results also show that perceived realism and interactivity of virtual experiences are key factors in the effectiveness of these experiences. This research provides a theoretical framework for understanding the influence of generative AI on tourism behavior and offers important practical implications for destination marketers and policymakers in the post-COVID tourism industry.},

  abstract={Since modern life dictates human comforts, it is not surprising that the revolution of the wireless technology dominated very quickly in industrial nations, which is unlike the practical world of yore when activities required extra physical efforts to be accomplished. Nowadays, physical tasks are avoided. Therefore, it is the time to lunch quick transformations in artificial material, based on nano-scale structures and metamaterial inclusions, design to accelerate the development of modern photonic devices that have suffered from several limitations such as availability, integrability, reconfigurability, immutability, and maintainability in which the material electromagnetic specifications play the major role. This paper presents a Python implementation of a Generative-Adversarial-Network (GAN) tailored for the design and optimization of metamaterials for nano-photonics devices. The GAN consists of a generator model that produces synthetic 2D nanostructure patterns and a discriminator model that distinguishes between real and generated patterns. The goal is to generate novel designs that exhibit desirable optical properties. The code leverages TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the GAN, utilizing the MNIST dataset as a placeholder for metamaterial data. In a JupyterLab environment, the code generates and visualizes the evolving designs during training. By refining the generator through adversarial training, this approach lays the groundwork for automating the design of metamaterial-based photonic devices, reducing the need for labor-intensive trial-and-error processes and enabling rapid exploration of the design space. The implementation can be adapted to incorporate physics-based simulations for evaluating optical performance, providing a robust framework for the automated discovery of next-generation metamaterials.},

  abstract={Summary <p>The aim of this chapter is to delve not into the technicalities of AI but rather into the broader mindset, rules, and attitudes surrounding it. In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, the legalities surrounding intellectual property (IP) rights are in constant flux. The matter of IP rights for AI&#x2010;generated content is intricate and varies across jurisdictions and terms of use. Bias, an unwelcome specter, can insidiously creep into generative AI models through myriad avenues. One of the most prevalent culprits is biased training data. The chapter discusses the social implications of biased AI&#x2010;generated data on real&#x2010;world applications. It also explores the misinformation and misuse of generative AI. While some nations are proactively drafting guidelines and laws that address AI ethics, transparency, and accountability, the swift evolution of AI often eclipses the pace of these regulatory endeavors, leading to potential oversight voids.</p>},

  abstract={A country's critical infrastructures are heavily related to the quality of life and safety of the people. As a result, the security protection aspect of critical infrastructure has gained more and more attention nowadays, especially the security of its industrial control system (ICS). To avoid the abnormal condition happening in the critical infrastructure which could put people in great danger, a system that is capable of detecting any abnormal state of the ICS promptly is needed. Fortunately, due to the dramatic growth of the applications of machine learning in recent years, some researchers have already proposed anomaly detection methods with machine learning to provide instant warning and protection for ICS. However, most of the existing anomaly detection research tends to only target one cause that harms the system, such as attacks on the network or physical equipment failures. The ICS will be more comprehensively secured if the anomaly detection system can cover multiple aspects of the ICS. Therefore, we have established a non-normal warning system with the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for dam operations in this study, which can detect various types of non-normal operations and notify relevant personnel right away. Note that we use real historical data to make predictions and verify our warning system, and we improve it even more by implementing the visual analysis method, which makes up the indecipherable results often found in unsupervised learning.},

  abstract={The designers' tendency to adhere to a specific mental set and heavy emotional investment in their initial ideas often limit their ability to innovate during the design ideation process. The shrinking time-to-market and the growing diversity of users' needs further exacerbate this gap. Recent advances in deep generative models have created new possibilities to overcome the cognitive obstacles of designers through automated generation or editing of design concepts. This article explores the capabilities of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for automated, attribute-aware generative design of the visual attributes of a product. Specifically, a design attribute GAN (DA-GAN) model is developed for automated generation of fashion product images with the desired visual attributes. Experiments on a large fashion dataset signify the potentials of GAN for attribute-aware generative design, verify the ability of editing attributes with relatively higher accuracy and uncover several key challenges and research questions for future work.},

  abstract={Given the extensive application of artificial intelligence (AI) within the educational domain, college teachers’ behavioral intention to adopt AI-assisted teaching systems (AIATS) has emerged as a critical topic, with gaps in the breadth of samples and the diversity of methods. To further delve into the principal elements affecting college teachers’ inclination towards AIATS, this research constructs an integrative theoretical framework that synthesizes the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with the Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT), while comprehensively considering internal and external factors. The investigation collected sample data from a questionnaire survey, which reached 529 college teachers in China, and undertook data analysis employing SPSS 27.0 and AMOS 26.0. The findings revealed that: 1) college teachers’ behavioral intention to embrace AIATS is directly and significantly shaped by perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, trust and subjective norms; 2) factors such as observability, relative advantage and compatibility indirectly impact college teachers’ adoption willingness of AIATS through their perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness; 3) complexity of AIATS positively affects perceived ease of use by means of perceived time cost, thereby influencing behavioral intention; 4) sociocultural factors significantly impact the adoption and promotion of AIATS in China. By extending the applicability of TAM and IDT within the realm of educational technology acceptance, this study offers strategic recommendations geared towards educational policymakers and technology developers to promote the implementation of AIATS, and sheds light on educational technology adoption across diverse sociocultural landscapes.},

  abstract={ $F$ lood disasters pose significant threats to communities around the world. In Malaysia, floods are recurrent and severe natural disasters due to its geographical location. Focusing on the response phase of flood disaster management, this study identifies the critical issues involved, including the limitations of manual observation in traditional methods and the lack of structured flood image databases. This research explores the use of generative artificial intelligence (gen-AI) to create synthetic images as an alternative source in flood disaster detection and response. By adopting a systematic approach with the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm, the model is trained on gen-AI-produced synthetic images and tested using real drone-captured images from past flood events. The model demonstrates promising preliminary results with the highest performing model, achieving a mean average precision (mAP50) of 96.7%, mAP@[0.5,0.95] of 78.7% and an F1 score of 90.8%. These findings highlight the potential of gen-AI in supporting flood disaster response efforts in Malaysia, aiming to integrate the mix of synthetic images during non-flooding periods and actual drone images during flood scenarios into the comprehensive FloodIntel framework for future research.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are widely applied in image generation, but their use raises potential security concerns. We propose a novel adversarial attack method based on statistical analysis to identify and analyze the vulnerabilities of image classification systems, ultimately enhancing their defense capabilities. Specifically, we generate statistically significant yet minimally perturbed adversarial samples using GANs, facilitating adversarial learning between the generator and classifier to investigate the statistical characteristics of adversarial samples and their impact on classifier decisions. Through experimental analysis on classic image classification datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by comparing it against traditional approaches. Our results show that the adversarial samples generated successfully deceive multiple classifiers while maintaining natural statistical characteristics, revealing inherent distribution properties of adversarial samples.},

  abstract={The collaboration among multiple agents demands for efficient communication. However, the observational data in the multi-agent systems are typically voluminous and redundant and pose substantial challenges to the communication system when transmitted directly. To address this issue, this paper introduces a multi-agent communication scheme based on large language model (LLM), referred to as GPT-based semantic information extraction for multi-agent communication (GMAC). This scheme utilizes an LLM to extract semantic information and leverages the generative capabilities to predict subsequent actions, thereby enabling agents to make more informed decisions. The GMAC approach significantly reduces signaling expenditure exchanged among agents by extracting key semantic data via LLM. This method not only simplifies the communication process but also effectively reduces the communication overhead by approximately 53% compared to the baseline methods. Experimental results indicate that GMAC not only improves the convergence speed and accuracy of decision-making but also substantially decreases the signaling expenditure among agents. Consequently, GMAC offers a straightforward and effective method to achieve efficient and economical communication in the multi-agent systems.},

  abstract={With the continuous improvement of China’s economic level, the scale of the power grid is also increasing, and it is developing towards high voltage, high current, and large capacity, which has led to a sharp increase in the probability of power sensor signal interference. This article first presents the general factors of signal interference in power sensors, and uses optoelectronic coupling isolation measures and twisted pair shielded wire long line transmission signals to design anti-interference signal transmission channels. This article regards the monitored equipment as a dynamic linear system and establishes an anti-interference system for power sensor signals using state space equations. In response to the weak temporal and spatial correlation of data collected by each node in power sensors, the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) algorithm is used to filter a series of power sensor nodes. In the comparison of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and PSNR (Peak Signalto-Noise Ratio) of different algorithms, the RMSE (raw signal) of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is 0.23 and the RMSE (anti-interference signal) is 0.18. The PSNR (original signal) of GAN is 14.56, and the PSNR (anti-interference signal) is 17.89. The artificial intelligence based anti-interference system for power sensor signals helps to provide early warning for some anomalies, thereby improving the anti-interference ability of power sensor signals.},

  abstract={This paper presents an innovative approach to enhancing context understanding in Generative Pretrained Models (GPTs), a critical step towards achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While GPTs have significantly advanced natural language processing, their understanding of context remains predominantly limited to linguistic structure. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel layer in the transformer model architecture that computes context weights, integrating both immediate and temporally decaying influences of past tokens. This layer is strategically positioned after the self-attention and before the feed-forward layers, enabling a more nuanced interpretation of sequential language data. Our approach involves the formulation of a decaying temporal factor, which allows the model to consider not only the immediate relevance of tokens but also their historical context. This factor is dynamically adjustable, offering a sophisticated method of context weighting that considers both current and extended contexts. The integration of this context weight into the self-attention mechanism enhances the model's capacity for a deeper, more accurate understanding of language, pushing the boundaries of current AI capabilities towards a system that mirrors human-like intelligence. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, showing its potential to significantly contribute to the development of AGI.},

  abstract={In the era of Artificial Intelligence and specifically in the sub-category of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenIA), the trend in the context of Data Centers is to be able to integrate traditional network architectures that are still managed as Ethernet networks with new ones. GenIA-based network structures that use low latency protocols such as InfiniBand and that allow parallel processing. In this work, a novel network architecture is presented that integrates the relevant aspects of Ethernet networks and the new GenIA Back End networks. We also deal with aspects related to protocols, bandwidth, design of a GenIA network architecture, components of GenIA networks and cooling systems. The main objective of this article is to analyze, through the Radial Basic Function (RBF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms, which are part of the scope of Neural Networks (NN), how the dependent variable or metric GPU Performance behaves, since it is one of the critical aspects in the middle of modern data center architectures. To achieve this, a series of independent variables are defined such as GPU Memory Access, Memory Bandwidth, Throughput, Power Consumption, Temperature, and Clock Speed. With the RBF algorithm, these sub-metrics are analyzed taking into consideration the number of units that may be in each of the hidden layers and the level of importance of the variable, while, with the MLP, the number of units established both in hidden layer 1 and 2, respectively, and the importance level and normalized importance to analyze the behavior of these sub-metrics. The latter is presented through case studies and helps to identify which metrics are more relevant than others in terms of operation, performance, and efficiency of GPU performance metrics.},

  abstract={A well-balanced dataset is essential for every computer vision task. However, the process of gathering data from various sources is laborious and time-consuming. The lack of samples and class imbalance will reduce the reliability of the CNN model in image classification and recognition tasks. In this research, we examine the use of Image-to-Image translation with conditional GAN for producing synthetic mango images with bruises. We introduce a conditional GAN for producing mango images with controlled surface defects, which is suited for dataset augmentation tasks within the fruit classification problem domain. The findings shows that our networks is able to generate mango images with bruises that are very close to the ground truth with FID value of 37.0},

The paper presents a thorough background study in the AI/ML field of culinary and the existing applications in the recipe generation domain. Authors came across various recipe recommendations, cocktail generators, and cuisine-specific recommendations. However, none focused on Indian Recipe Generation, which could be a new field to explore. Therefore, the authors attempt to employ a working model that generates unique, non-existing cuisine- centric recipes for users to eat with a specific focus on Indian Cuisine. Using the Autochef algorithm [1], authors generated a series of generations of recipes supported by mutation and similarity. The process included dataset cleaning, preprocessing, and developing a generalized structure for recipes that can be fitted to a model. Finally, the authors train the model to generate Indian Recipes with the dynamics of artificial intelligence and the acceptance of AI-generated new recipes found among the Indian Diaspora.},

  pages={87621-87639},
  abstract={The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in interior design has revolutionized how spaces are conceptualized, visualized, and classified. As digital tools and generative design models become increasingly sophisticated, distinguishing between AI-generated and real-world interior design images has emerged as a critical challenge. This classification is essential for ensuring authenticity in design visualization, improving recommendation systems, and enhancing virtual and augmented reality applications in architectural planning. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be highly effective in image classification tasks due to their ability to learn complex spatial hierarchies, making them particularly well-suited for differentiating between AI-rendered and real interior spaces. However, recent advancements in deep learning, including hybrid AI models and transformer-based vision networks, have further enhanced classification accuracy by integrating multimodal learning techniques. This study explores the use of advanced pre-trained CNN models, including DenseNet, RegNet, and SqueezeNet architecture, to classify interior design images. By leveraging a proprietary dataset composed of diverse AI-generated and real-world interior designs, our model achieved a peak classification accuracy of 97%, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning techniques. Additionally, we introduce a novel image preprocessing technique that enhances feature extraction by adjusting lighting, texture, and noise levels, thereby reducing discrepancies between AI-rendered and real images. The results indicate that AI approaches, CNNs, hold immense potential for further improving classification robustness. This study contributes to the growing field of AI-driven interior design classification by presenting a high-accuracy model capable of distinguishing between real and AI-generated environments with unprecedented precision.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) encounter several challenges such as the generation of unrealistic images, the production of synthetic images with limited diversity, and the risk of overfitting to the training dataset. These challenges hinder the extensive application of GANs in medical fields, where obtaining large medical image datasets is constrained by high costs, time limitations, and patient privacy concerns. To address these issues, we propose a modified Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) model specifically designed for breast ultrasound (BUS) images under limited training data conditions. Our approach improves the consistency of the adversarial process and enhances the feature-capturing ability of GANs. The proposed model incorporates three key modifications and two promising training techniques: (1) replacing the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation in the generator with the Scaled Exponential Linear Unit (SELU) activation, (2) implementing Spectral Normalization (SN), and (3) incorporating a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block in the discriminator, (4) using label smoothing, and (5) applying asymmetric learning rate techniques during training. Evaluation results, based on Inception Score (IS), Mean Squared Error (MSE) metrics, and visual comparison, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional DCGAN architectures when trained on a limited dataset. These findings confirm that our approach provides a promising solution to the challenges of medical image synthesis in data-limited environments.},

  abstract={In today's society, even though the technology is so developed, the coloring of computer images has remained at the manual stage. As a carrier of human culture and art, film has existed in our history for hundred years. With the development of science and technology, movies have developed from the simple black-and-white film era to the current digital age. There is a very complicated process for coloring old movies. Aside from the traditional hand-painting techniques, the most common method is to use post-processing software for coloring movie frames. This kind of operation requires extraordinary skills, patience and aesthetics, which is a great test for the operator. In recent years, the extensive use of machine learning and neural networks has made it possible for computers to intelligently process images. Since 2016, various types of generative adversarial networks models have been proposed to make deep learning shine in the fields of image style transfer, image coloring, and image style change. In this case, the experiment uses the generative adversarial networks principle to process pictures and videos to realize the automatic rendering of old documentary movies.},

  abstract={Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has made remarkable progress in a range of domains. However, its inherent random exploration mechanism leads to low efficiency, especially in complex environments where the time complexity of strategy exploration is high. To overcome this challenge, we propose a Deep Q-Learning based on the Generative Adversarial Model algorithm (DQN-GAN), aiming to improve exploration efficiency in deep reinforcement learning. The core of the DQN-GAN algorithm is to generate more diverse actions, thereby effectively simplifying the complex exploration process. Specifically, the proposed algorithm utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to train a generator that generates diverse actions, enriching the exploration space. Meanwhile, a discriminator is trained with real demonstration data to ensure that the generated actions are highly consistent with actual data. Experimental data demonstrates that the integration of GAN into deep Q-learning exhibits significant performance improvements in OpenAI Gym environments. The proposed algorithm not only optimizes the exploration process but also enhances learning efficiency.},

  abstract={The Erasmus+ Ethical Engineer project aims to enhance AI education by integrating ethical, social, and legal aspects into engineering training, promoting truthful AI in Europe. In the paper, we present the explored case studies and the methodology for their development. AI ethics is explored through the following case studies. AI in healthcare is examined through fall detection systems for vulnerable populations, the potential for data bias in personalized medical devices, and the ethical implications of off-label device use, such as continuous artificial hearts. The use of AI in witness testimonies is considered through the example of the AIWitness chatbot designed to automate witness statements. Ethical considerations surrounding facial recognition are explored in the context of airport boarding, using a hypothetical scenario based on Brighton International Airport's pilot program, FaceBoard. The project also considers self-driving taxis' ethical and practical implications, using a hypothetical scenario in San Francisco. The ecological impact of generative AI is analyzed, referencing studies from Stanford University on energy consumption and water usage for cooling systems. The ethical challenges of AI in marketing processes are addressed, including the generation of content like text, images, and voice, along with concerns about job displacement, fake content creation, and authorship issues. The use of AI in assessing historic photos is examined, focusing on selection bias, the potential for surfacing insulting content, the need for transparency, and the potential prioritization of profit over ethical considerations. Finally, the paper addresses the pervasive issue of bias in data, particularly within the field of data science. The main contribution of the paper is the development of a structured template for creating AI ethics case studies, which we already tested with smaller groups of teachers and students and refined based on their feedback.},

  abstract={This paper examines the role of generative artificial intelligence (AI), in influencing employee well-being within the hospitality industry. Drawing upon the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, the study delves into how diverse job demands and resources affect the well-being of hotel frontliners, while also testing the moderating influence of generative AI on this relationship. Employing an online survey methodology, primary data were gathered from 220 frontliners working in selected hotels in Makassar, Indonesia. The findings reveal a significant negative impact of job demands on employee well-being, underscoring the adverse effects of factors such as workload, time pressure, and emotional demands on hotel frontliners. Conversely, job resources are found to have a positive and significant influence on employee well-being, emphasizing the pivotal role of supportive factors such as autonomy, social support, and opportunities for skill development in enhancing well-being. Moreover, the study identifies generative AI as a noteworthy moderator in this context. These findings hold implications for both theoretical understanding and practical applications in human resource management within the hospitality industry. As the hospitality sector continues to integrate AI technologies, prioritizing employee well-being emerges as a critical factor in sustaining a motivated and productive workforce.},

Forefront with the LLM GPT-4 was the AI that obtained better results. The impact of this research is expected to contribute towards automating some of the phases of SRLs. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind limitations associated with the technology used to support this research, such as the rapid changes that AIs and their LLMs are currently undergoing, or potential restrictions on the number of requests per minute that AIs can receive as well as restrictions on the geographical location (since not all these AIs are available in all countries).},

  pages={518-522},
  abstract={In recent years, Generative AI has emerged as a rapidly evolving tool in visual art, enabling quick image creation and flexible editing capabilities. These tools can produce striking visuals in a short amount of time and at significantly lower costs than human artists, making them accessible even to individuals with limited art skills. However, AI has also triggered debates over copyright, ethics, and the broader impact on artistic value, particularly regarding commissions and style replication. This paper offers a concise review of notable AI systems and presents qualitative insights from focus group discussions and interviews with senior Thai artists, professionals who have long served as both educators and practitioners. Although AI can aid rapid idea generation and stylistic experimentation, the participating artists emphasize the enduring importance of foundational skills–such as sketching and color theory–in achieving a genuine aesthetic. Rather than viewing AI as a threat, they acknowledge its potential to inspire creativity, yet they also stress that handmade art remains vital for cultural preservation, educational value, and personal artistic identity. By integrating these expert perspectives with established research, this study underscores both the advantages and drawbacks of AI-driven art, ultimately advocating for balanced curricula, transparent ethical guidelines, and collaborative strategies to ensure that technology supports, rather than overshadows, the human aesthetic experience.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence is changing the world, especially the interaction between machines and humans. Learning and interpreting natural languages and responding have paved the way for many technologies and applications. The amalgam of machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing helped Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) to change the face of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). A conversational agent is an excellent example of conversational AI, which imitates the natural language. This article presents a sweeping overview of conversational agents that includes different techniques such as pattern-based, machine learning, and deep learning used to implement conversational agents. It also discusses the panorama of different tasks in conversational agents. This study also focuses on how conversational agents can simulate human behavior by adding emotions, sentiments, and affect to the context. With the advancements in recent trends and the rise in deep learning models, the authors review the deep learning techniques and various publicly available datasets used in conversational agents. This article unearths the research gaps in conversational agents and gives insights into future directions.},

  volume={},

  pages={2872-2876},
  abstract={This paper presents our submission to the Financial Narrative Summarization (FNS) task at the FNP-2023 workshop. The FNS task involves the generation of concise summaries, not exceeding 1000 words, for annual financial reports composed in English, Spanish, and Greek. In our prior work, presented in FNP-2022, we introduced DiMSum [1], a novel framework designed to automatically identify crucial narrative sections within financial reports and quantify their weighted contributions. The field of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently witnessed significant advancements, prompting us to explore their utility in summarizing financial reports. Our investigation revealed that LLMs, when left to their own devices often struggle to effectively summarize complex financial documents, necessitating external guidance. In this study, we demonstrate how LLMs, when guided by the DiMSum framework, exhibit substantial improvements in the quality of financial report summarization. To the best of our knowledge, this research marks the first instance of applying LLMs to the FNS task, offering a novel approach to enhancing the summarization of financial reports.},

  title={QR-GAN: Generative Adversarial Networks meet Quantile Regression}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={This study proposes a novel Quantile Regression Generative Adversarial Networks (QR-GAN), which uses quantile regression to improve GAN performance by mitigating issues of GAN such as non-convergence, mode collapse, and gradient problems. Instead of directly minimizing the 1-Wasserstein distance between real and generated data distributions, as in WGANs, the proposed method leverages the quantile loss to encourage the generator to produce a diverse range of outputs. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the output space of the discriminator and the gradients of fake samples to identify the root causes of mode collapse. Our study reveals that constraining the discriminator to specific values can lead to mode collapse. The proposed QR-GAN method exhibits a high level of robustness against mode collapse and significantly improves the generation performance, as measured by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) metric, compared to other GAN variants. These findings suggest that the proposed QR-GAN method has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in GAN research and improve their applicability in a variety of domains.},

  abstract={Organoid intelligence (OI), the next paradigm of intelligence, draws inspiration from the biological learning of organs. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) draws its inspiration only from the cognitive processes of the brain. While taking ethical and technological limitations into account, biological learning helps to conceptualize, accept, and apply them. Just as AI helped to make supercomputers possible, OI may help create biocomputers. Even though AI has increased the capabilities of technology to unimaginable heights, it still appears immature and is steadily moving toward cognitive computing to push the envelope even farther. In contrast to AI, OI is a new multidisciplinary computer area that attempts to be more approachable. OI has the ability to produce novel biocomputers, such as organoids, that use parts derived from live organisms to perform computational tasks. Organoids, such as human nasal organoids, are microscopic tissue cultures made from stem cells that mimic some of the functions of real organs. Although they have been used for many different purposes, including drug discovery and illness modeling, scientists are only now beginning to explore their potential for biological information processing.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AI), specifically Large Language Models (LLMS) such as generative pretrained transformers (GPTS) have emerged as a transformational technology in modern research and applications. This technology will revolutionize a wide variety of fields, including remote sensing and Earth observation. We explore the use of LLMS to improve and automate EO analysis, making these results more accessible to a broad range of decision makers. We develop a framework using this technology to support the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) and NASA’s Open Science initiative. This framework leverages current work on Earth observation tools, including the Open Data Cube (ODC) [1] and the OEA Algorithm Hub (AlgoHub). [2]In our work, we investigate the ability of large language models to orchestrate and reason with tools created to access geospatial data using the Open Data Cube and the OEA Algorithm Hub [2]. In this paper we propose a natural language analytical framework for orchestrating Earth observation (EO) analysis. The framework uses large language models to interpret an analysis request, devise a solution based on ODC and AlgoHub tools, and execute the analysis. Our experimental investigations demonstrate that an LLM, with its embedded contextual knowledge, can effectively discern and sequence the necessary processing steps required to fulfill Earth observation analysis requests. This research demonstrates the potential of Generative AI (LLMs) in streamlining and enhancing EO analyses and empowering the observation community.In summary, Generative AI (LLMs) can enhance the capabilities of Earth observation analysis by automating tasks, providing natural language interfaces, and facilitating the extraction of valuable insights from the vast and complex datasets generated by remote sensing and EO technologies.},
