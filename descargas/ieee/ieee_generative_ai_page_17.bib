  abstract={In 2021, driven by the ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, previous works [1], [2] introduced architectures for fully automated blue teams in cyber defense exercises such as Locked Shields (LS). Since then, technological and scientific progress has further accelerated. In particular, the rapid evolution of generative AI through large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of cybersecurity automation. This paper reviews how cyber blue team automation can benefit from these recent advances, with a focus on how generative AI and LLMs are reshaping automation strategies for defending complex cyber infrastructure. Using the LS exercise as a case study, we discuss how generative AI-based automation can address the growing complexity of cyber threats. Our paper presents promising directions on how generative AI can enhance fully automated blue teams, and it addresses a major research gap—the lack of high-quality datasets for training and evaluation in this field. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel dataset containing labeled network traffic and end-host logs, collected during the “partners' run” preceding LS 2024. This dataset is derived from over 400 GB of captured network traffic and more than 6 million log entries. It captures real-world red team behavior and is made publicly available to foster research and AI development in the field of blue team automation. We conclude with future research challenges in automated cyber defense.},

  abstract={With the increasing integration of renewable energies, power electronic devices and flexible loads, modern power systems are becoming more sophisticated and facing higher uncertainty. Traditional model-based methods cannot fully satisfy the analysis and control requirements of modern power systems duo to its complexity and uncertainty. At the same time, with the deployment of smart meters and advanced sensors, an unprecedented amount of data is generated by the power systems all the time. The generated data have great value and can make up for the deficiency of the traditional physical model based approaches. Driven by data, artificial intelligence can directly learn from data, and needs no simplifications and/or assumptions of the physical model. Great success has been achieved in the fields of artificial intelligence in recent years, bringing new opportunities of applying the state-of-the-art machine learning technologies to power systems. This special section focusses on some of the emerging technologies to solve existing challenges and solutions for the application of artificial intelligence in modern power systems. Thirteen articles included in this special section are summarized as follows: In the paper entitled “Reinforcement Learning and Its Applications in Modern Power and Energy Systems: A Review”, the authors make a comprehensive review of applications of reinforcement learning in modern power and energy system. The basic ideas and various types of methods of reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning and multiagent deep reinforcement learning algorithms are first illustrated, respectively. Then their applications for the optimization of smart power and energy distribution grid, demand side management, electricity market and operational control are discussed in detailed.

  abstract={Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can be used to automate highly repeatable business processes. However, it might struggle in non-deterministic situations where some sort of understanding is required. For example, it can automatically load all the students’ answers from an online examination, but it cannot mark them without the help of some kind of AI. This significantly limits its capabilities. Generative AI and applications such as ChatGPT have many potential applications as they can generate and understand natural language text, making them ideal candidates for addressing the limitations of RPA. In this paper, we propose a practical way of enhancing Robotic Process Automation using Generative AI. This work also includes a practical case study that uses Visual Studio C#, Selenium, and ChatGPT for automatically grading students’ examination attempts in the Moodle Learning Management System. The results show that the application managed to grade the students with minimal human input.},

  pages={5040-5049},
  abstract={In this work, we propose two convolutional neural network (CNN) based metrics, classification score (CS) and distribution score (DS), for performance evaluation of generative adversarial networks (GANs). Though GAN-generated images can be evaluated through manual assessment of visual fidelity, it is prolonged, subjective, challenging, tiresome, and can be misleading. Existing quantitative methods are biased toward memory GAN and fail to detect overfitting. CS and DS allow us to experimentally prove that training of GANs is actually guided by the dataset that it improves with every epoch and gets closer to following the distribution of the dataset. Both methods are based on GAN-generated image classification by CNN. CS is the root mean square (rms) value of three different classification techniques, direct classification (DC), indirect classification (IC), and blind classification (BC). It exhibits the degree to which GAN can learn the features and generate fake images similar to real datasets. DS shows the contrast between the mean distribution of GAN-generated data and the real data. It indicates the extent to which GANs can create synthetic images with similar distribution to real datasets. We evaluated CS and DS metrics for different variants of GANs and compared their performances with existing metrics. Results show that CS and DS can evaluate the different variants of GANs quantitatively and qualitatively while detecting overfitting and mode collapse.},

  title={MGDefect: A Mask-Guided High-Quality Defect Image Generation Method for Improving Defect Inspection}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={27},
  number={},
  pages={6113-6126},
  abstract={Deep learning based defect inspection methods have achieved promising performance, which usually relies on a large number of well-labeled training samples. However, it requires much effort to obtain enough annotated samples especially pixel-level annotations in practical production. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be utilized to generate defect samples. However, training GANs typically requires a large amount of defect data and most of them cannot generate defect samples with pixel-level annotations. In this paper, we present a Mask-Guided Defect image generation method, called MGDefect, which can generate high-quality defect samples with pixel-level annotations and effectively improves the performance of downstream tasks. Specifically, MGDefect consists of a Mask-Guided Defect Generation GAN (MGDG-GAN) and a Defect Mask GAN (DM-GAN). MGDG-GAN generates images containing defects with specific locations, shapes, and sizes via mask guidance and the dual discrimination for defects at the region level and image level. DM-GAN aims to generate diverse and rational masks for MGDG-GAN. It also adopts region-level and image-level dual discrimination for masks to generate compatible masks with the target objects. MGDG-GAN mainly focuses on generating local defect regions and DM-GAN specializes in generating masks, which are both trained on limited defect samples and abundant normal samples. Experiments conducted on the MVTec AD, DAGM 2007, and KolektorSDD2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves promising results compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Meanwhile, the generated defect samples significantly improve the performance of defect inspection tasks including classification and segmentation. Specifically, our method achieves KID$\times 10^{3}$/IS scores of 48.35/2.27 on MVTec AD, 15.37/2.44 on DAGM 2007, and 19.70/2.01 on KolektorSDD2. Furthermore, our method improves mIoU by 10.59%, 2.20%, and 2.17% on these datasets, respectively, using U-Net as the segmentation model.},

  abstract={This study explores the impact of perceived risk and trust on the willingness of journalists to use generative AI (GenAl) technology. As AI evolves, its applications in journalism, such as automated news writing and personalized content recommendations, have grown significantly. However, the adoption of GenAl by journalists is influenced by various factors, with perceived risk and trust being paramount. Perceived risk encompasses the uncertainties and potential negative outcomes associated with using the technology, while trust pertains to the confidence in the technology's reliability, security, and effectiveness. This research aims to fill the gap in empirical studies on these factors by constructing a theoretical model based on risk perception and trust theories. The study employs a detailed survey, validated through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), to measure journalists' perceived risks, trust, and their willingness to use GenAl. Findings from this research are expected to offer valuable insights for the journalism industry, providing strategies to mitigate perceived risks and enhance trust, thereby promoting broader adoption of GenAl. Additionally, the results will contribute to the theoretical understanding of technology adoption in journalism and other professional domains.},

  abstract={The process of visual inspection has been significantly improved with addition of AI with human in the loop. In this paper, we introduce new features to enhance our end–to‒end visual inspection framework for HBMs. We detect individual HBMs consisting of multiple components along with providing a full report for the scanned chip providing 3D metrology information, details on defects and possible root cause analysis for the defects. Our modular approach can integrate any object detection and segmentation deep learning model based on the inspection requirements. We introduce a multi-view approach to increase the robustness of the detection and identification framework for defective bumps. Our approach can directly process high-resolution 3D scans and generate automatically an inspection report from our generative AI model. On our HBM dataset, the defective bump identification increased by 46%. We also conduct a study on learning with less labels. With varied percentages of labeled data, we achieved segmentation accuracy of 87% on memory bumps respectively with only utilizing 25% labelled bumps for training our AI models. The Inspection reports are customized using our 3D Metrology toolbox and Large Language Models (LLMs) providing possible causes and suggestions. We then propose a fully automated system, that with one click is able to provide a comprehensive report of the entire dense 3D scan consisting of more than 400 bumps in under 5 minutes. This system shows immense promise to expedite the inspection process and ultimately be used for inline inspection with 3D scanners.},

Illustrations depicting AI as robots reflect the difficulty in drawing AI software in a way everyone will instantly recognize. In a nutshell, GenAI generates outputs that appear to be original thoughts or images from a computer, rather than results produced by very advanced, contextual predictive software. GenAI delivers outputs according to the user's vision and skilled prompting. The AI is merely mimicking human behavior. Models learn human behavioral patterns along with data patterns from their training dataset. GenAI interacts through natural language and generates new content by repurposing data into new outputs. GenAI models are the subject of many news stories, water&#x2010;cooler talks, zoom meetings, and online chats. AI&#x2010;generated content still needs human curation to ensure quality and relevance.</p>},

  abstract={While AI has many advantages, it also has a few drawbacks associated with “deep fakes.” Deep fakes involve the creation of very realistic videos and images realized through technologies that work with facial and voice modalities for deceptive purposes. Researchers have developed various techniques to detect these manipulated videos and images, employing complex neural network models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, deep fakes are very difficult to identify due to lighting and shadow effects that may hide some signs of manipulation. No one technique of detection could have the ability of identifying the tampered images under all kinds of illumination conditions. This paper compares different CNN models-ResNet50, EfficientNet, and MobileNetV2-to improve detection accuracy so as to be more resistant to new deep fake techniques, in particular under different illumination conditions. The importance of the study lies in arriving at which of the considered CNN models turns out to be most accurate under a specific illumination effect. Such an understanding could, therefore, improve the results of detection even when applied to cases of tampered faces in fake Aadhaar detection and fake id detection, thereby clearly bringing out the usefulness of the research in practice.},

  pages={395-401},
  abstract={In this paper, we introduce a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model designed to reconstruct images of artistic Arabic calligraphy characters. One of the major challenges in this field is the limited availability of datasets containing artistic Arabic calligraphy that are written with calligraphy pens and adhering traditional artistic rules, making it difficult to develop models that accurately capture the unique visual and structural intricacies of the script. To address this issue, we propose a method to compress the vector representation from $28 \times 28$ pixel images in the input layer to a 26-dimensional latent space while leveraging two newly developed artistic Arabic calligraphy datasets. Various VAE configuration parameters were tested to enhance reconstruction efficiency. The training phase utilized the publicly available Arabic Handwritten Character Dataset (AHCD) and the two new datasets in the Naskh and Reqaa styles, created using specialized calligraphy pens. During testing, these datasets were evaluated individually and in combination, with the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for each reconstruction experiment recorded. The average reconstruction MSE values were 0.0532, 0.0405, and 0.0289 for the Naskh, Reqaa, and combined datasets, respectively. Our results demonstrate the significance of dataset type in the quality of reconstructed artistic calligraphy and suggest future improvements through larger, more diverse datasets.},

  abstract={Semi-supervised learning presents a challenge in preparing a classifier in a dataset that has few marked and many unlabelled models. The GAN architecture is expanded by the semi-supervised GAN model, which involves preparing a managed discriminator, an unaided discriminator, and a generator model simultaneously. The result is a managed grouping model that effectively sums up hidden models and a generator model that produces possible instances of pictures from the domain. The aim of research is to study semi-supervised learning problems using GANs for regression. The goal of reverse engineering is to predict the continuum of data given rather than simply splitting the work into a small number of different categories. In the case of autonomous driving, for example, it is very expensive to obtain a sufficient number of written standards covering all driving. In this particular case, we can use the semi-supervised learning method together with the basic structure design, such as the creation of negative networks. The proposed GAN-based semi-supervised writing strategies are centered around addressing the characterization issue. The problem of developing a semi-supervised method using GAN for regression tasks is still unresolved. Reg-GAN has been presented in two different architectures to address this issue.},

  abstract={The prediction of the pore structure of rock formations is of critical importance for the comprehension of fluid flow and storage capacity in underground reservoirs. The conventional techniques frequently encounter difficulties in addressing the intricacy and variability of pore distribution. In this work, we put forward a novel GAN framework that has been designed with the specific purpose of predicting pore structures. The framework comprises a generator that generates images of pore structures incorporating authentic geological characteristics through a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), while simultaneously performing feature extraction on the input geological data. The discriminator employs the adversarial training strategy, which enables the differentiation and assessment of generated samples and real samples through the convolutional layer. The minimised adversarial loss function is utilised to enhance the authenticity of the generated samples. The model was trained on multiple geological sample datasets, combining different pore characteristics and spatial distribution information, in order to ensure its generalisability and accuracy. The results of the experimental analysis demonstrate that our GAN-based method is markedly more effective than the traditional prediction model, exhibiting enhanced accuracy and reliability in capturing the spatial distribution of pore structures.},

  year={2024},
  volume={11},
  number={6},
  pages={7929-7940},
  abstract={The quality of the dataset is critical to the performance of neural networks for error prediction in 3-D printing. In order to enlarge the dataset, we propose a customized two-stage framework, cascaded cross-modality generative adversarial networks (CCMGANs), for generating dental crown meshes in an unsupervised manner. At the first stage, a displacement map-guided generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to generate coarse meshes with diverse shapes. At the second stage, fine-grained details are added to the coarse meshes using an image-based GAN. Unlike previous work that integrates a differentiable renderer into the mesh deformation process directly, we adopt a two-step strategy. First, we use a depth image refinement module to achieve the domain transformation from the rendered depth images of the generated meshes to those of the real ones. Then, we propose a mesh refinement module to optimize the coarse meshes in an image-supervised manner. To alleviate the self-intersection problem, we propose a loss to penalize the distances of point pairs in self-intersection regions. Experimental results show that our method is able to generate highly realistic meshes and outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud generation method TreeGCN in terms of the metrics FDD, MMD-CD, MMD-EMD, and COV-EMD. Furthermore, we utilize the generated data to augment the original dataset, and demonstrate that the generated data can effectively improve the accuracy of the error prediction task in 3-D printing.},

  abstract={There is huge potential for artificial intelligence (AI)-driven attacks on Internet of Things (IoT) networks, particularly with the growing use of generative AI (GenAI) and regenerative AI (RGenAI). GenAIs are known for generating new datasets with similar attributes to their underlying trained datasets, while RGenAIs can reshape and adapt the inputs feeding GenAIs based on feedback responses. These AI technologies, when combined, can inflict massive costs on IoT networks that may be difficult to detect and resolve. In this paper, a contextual model is proposed to examine the possible scenarios of IoT network attacks arising from the combination of GenAI/RGenAI entities. This model constructs potential AIdriven attacks on IoT ecosystems as a looped process occurring in three phases: learn, deploy, and adapt.

  abstract={Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence namely in Deep Learning has heightened its adoption in many applications. Some are playing important roles to the extent that we are heavily dependent on them for our livelihood. However, as with all technologies, there are vulnerabilities that malicious actors could exploit. A form of exploitation is to turn these technologies, intended for good, to become dual-purposed instruments to support deviant acts like malicious software trojans. As part of proactive defense, researchers are proactively identifying such vulnerabilities so that protective measures could be developed subsequently. This research explores a novel blackbox trojanising approach using a simple network structure modification to any deep learning image classification model that would transform a benign model into a deviant one with a simple manipulation of the weights to induce specific types of errors. Propositions to protect the occurrence of such simple exploits are discussed in this research. This research highlights the importance of providing sufficient safeguards to these models so that the intended good of AI innovation and adoption may be protected.},

  abstract={Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and immersive technologies, such as Extended Reality (XR), coupled with complementary innovations like 5G/6G wireless communications, are paving the way for fully realized AI-XR metaverses. AI will play a pivotal role in this transformation, enabling the seamless convergence of virtual and physical worlds. Among the various AI applications, Generative AI (GenAI) stands out for creating rich, dynamic, and interactive virtual environments—essential elements for sustained metaverse growth and user engagement. To facilitate a deeper understanding of how GenAI will be integrated and utilized within the metaverse, we provide a comprehensive overview of GenAI and Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC). Specifically, we examine the potential influence of GenAI's on future metaverses, exploring both the opportunities it offers and the major challenges associated with its deployment. Additionally, we investigate the robustness of AIGC detection techniques against adversarial attacks, highlighting less-explored risks posed by adversarial examples. Finally, we highlight various open research issues related to GenAI, AIGC, the metaverse, and responsible innovation that merit further exploration.},

  abstract={The problem of data imbalance is defined as the uneven distribution of the training examples to the existing classes of a dataset. Among a wide variety of solutions, the oversampling techniques try to mitigate the problem by synthesizing artificial examples associated with the minority class. The huge success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) rendered them an attractive choice for oversampling and numerous researchers proposed modifications of GANs for imbalanced datasets. Nevertheless, the existing models employ the entire minority class for sample generation, thus being vulnerable to outliers and noisy data instances. In addition, the majority of the relevant research concerns image classification tasks, leaving a large gap for research with tabular data. Finally, another powerful and popular generative model, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has been rather overlooked by the community in class imbalance solutions. In this paper we present SB-GAN and SB-VAE, two generative models that identify borderline and noisy samples before they are trained. In this manner SB-GAN and SB-VAE learn better class distributions that are not distorted by the existence of outliers. The experimental evaluation of SB-GAN and SB-VAE with 4 tabular datasets revealed a superior performance against 8 state-of-the-art oversampling techniques.},

The plant is not just identified, but other details like its scientific name, medicinal applications, and suggested home remedies are also provided. The system is implemented using a hybrid ensemble of InceptionV3 and ConvNeXtTiny models, trained on a heterogeneous data set of 30 medicinal plants in order to provide secure and reliable classification.To recommend appropriate treatments, a collaborative filtering approach is used to compare the identified plant to Ayurvedic treatments in a structured CSV database. The system is accessed via a Streamlit-based web portal and an Android smartphone app, enabling real-time, on-the-spot plant identification and remedy recommendation. Model performance is measured in terms of accuracy, which decides its deployment readiness.

  abstract={Crowd flow generation, which aims to simulate the flows of crowd in the future is of great importance to many real-life applications including epidemic spreading and traffic management. The challenges of accurate crowd flow generation come from both the complex spatial-temporal correlations of crowd flow data and the small amount of training data, which is largely not well studied and addressed in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel attentive dual-head spatial-temporal generative adversarial network entitled ADST-GAN to simulate multi-step crowd flow. To augment the learning power of the generator, we adopt attentive temporal queue and self attention mechanism to automatically capture the complex global spatial-temporal dependencies of crowd flow data. As for the discriminator, we design a dual-head architecture with two-objective training to avoid the negative effects of quick overfitting. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments over the bike and taxi trip datasets in New York. The results demonstrate the proposed method outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines significantly in terms of the quality of simulated crowd flow data.},

  abstract={Active learning is a machine learning or artificial intelligence method that aims to achieve optimal model performance by actively selecting and labeling the most valuable samples, using the fewest high-quality labeled samples. Relevant works have already been conducted using information uncertainty to select valuable samples. However, its effectiveness for semantic segmentation tasks is relatively poor. In this paper, we propose an active learning framework based on the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) architecture for semantic segmentation task, which achieves efficient data selection while simultaneously enhancing semantic segmentation performance. The proposed framework combines the generator (i.e., semantic segmentation network) and the discriminator (i.e., data selection network) for jointly optimizing of both semantic segmentation and data selection tasks. Extensive experiments were conducted on the dataset, which was collected from real-world autonomous driving scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieved competitive results compared to other SOTA methods.},

To mitigate the problem, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method for time series data based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) with the long-short term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNN) as base modules. The nature of generative models is used to capture the distributions of high dimensional data, where the LSTM module is used to learn the temporal relationships. The proposed framework is designed with the capability to reconstruct input data after training, and the reconstruction errors based anomaly scores are assigned to each time step in the time series, which determines the anomalies. Experimental results show the superiorities and efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Packet loss is one of the top reasons for speech quality degradation in Voice over IP calls. Packet loss concealment (PLC) is a technique of facing packet loss. This article describes a system based on a deep neural network (DNN) and pre-trained frequency-consistent generative adversarial network (Fre-GAN), which aims to heal audio impairments caused by packet losses, thus impairing the quality of the audio playout. We use the sliding window method to simulate real-time audio processing and extract features within the window, a multi-layer fully connected network is applied to predict the mel-spectrogram of missing audio packets based on the context within the window, and a frequency- consistent generative adversarial network is used to convert the mel-spectrogram to a waveform and backfill it to the part of the dropped frame. We name this system PLCfre-GAN. In the 2022 INTERSPEECH Audio Deep PLC Challenge, we applied PLCfre- GAN to mitigate artificially simulated audio impairments. The processed audio we submitted surpasses the challenge zero- padding baseline and ranks the top 5 with a PLC-MOS score on the blind test dataset of 3.478. Compared with previous machine learning methods, the proposed system has shown a considerable improvement in the scores of several evaluation metrics, and the recognition accuracy of synthesized speech is also guaranteed even in the case of frequent loss.},

In this paper, we analyze the limitations of GConv, and propose an improved GConv to address those problems. While GConv modulates the convolution kernel equally at all pixels, the proposed method produces pixel-wise different kernels following not only the given latent vector but also the feature in each pixel. Even though the proposed method is a simple modification of GConv, it shows better performance compared to the standard convolution as well as GConv. To show the superiority of the proposed method, this paper provides experimental results on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Quantitative evaluations reveal that the proposed method improves both GAN and conditional GAN (cGAN) performance in terms of Frechet inception distance (FID).},

  abstract={This paper presents an outline of the applications of GenAI on psychology and mental health care. In case GenAI is integrated into practice, might succeed in diagnostics, therapy, and patient support. Current limitations of AI in therapeutic dialogues are exposed by the wider vocabulary and more nuanced emotional expressions found in humans. In addition, studies have shown that when AI chatbots are human-like, they are more likely to ensure better compliance and trust. Nevertheless, regulation around AI wellness applications is entirely unregulated, while ChatGPT has serious shortcomings regarding mental health counseling. Future directions should focus on developing niche language models as well as strict ethical and clinical validations. The present review stresses the need for interdisciplinary and rigorous improvements to the framework if generative AI is to be safely and effectively incorporated into mental health practice.},

  abstract={Enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation necessitates efficient data conversion, traditionally characterized by labor-intensive tasks, such as validation checks, field mapping, and transformations. While effective, these methods are time-consuming and costly. With the advent of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), data conversion has been revolutionized, significantly reducing manual intervention. Traditional methods, often labor-intensive and costly, are replaced by automated Gen AI solutions. This innovation not only reduces technical effort and business involvement but also accelerates project timelines and lowers costs. This article explores the implementation of a Gen AI-driven solution that automates data extraction, validation, and mapping, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Utilizing advanced technologies, such as SQL, Python pandas, and PyTorch, this approach reimagines the workflow, enabling faster and more reliable ERP implementations with minimal disruption. By harnessing the power of machine learning and neural networks, the system evolves continuously, offering a scalable and robust solution for modern enterprises navigating the complexities of digital transformation. The adoption of Gen AI in data conversion thus represents a pivotal advancement, enabling faster, more reliable ERP implementations, and fostering greater operational resilience and adaptability.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in general, and large language models (LLMs) in particular, are highly fashionable. As they have the ability to generate coherent output based on prompts in natural language, they are promoted as tools to free knowledge workers from tedious tasks such as content writing, customer support and routine computer code generation. Unsurprisingly, their application is also attractive to professionals in the research domain, where mundane and laborious tasks, such as literature screening, are commonplace. We evaluate Vertex AI ‘text-bison’, a foundational LLM model, in a real-world academic scenario by replicating parts of a popular systematic review in the information management domain. By comparing the results of a zero-shot LLM-based approach with those of the original study, we gather evidence on the suitability of state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs for the analysis of scientific content. We show that the LLM-based approach delivers good scientific content analysis performance for a general classification problem (ACC =0.9), acceptable performance for a domain-specific classification problem (ACC =0.8) and borderline performance for a text comprehension problem (ACC ≈0.69). We conclude that some content analysis tasks with moderate accuracy requirements may be supported by current LLMs. As the technology will evolve rapidly in the foreseeable future, studies on large corpora, where some inaccuracies are tolerable, or workflows that prepare large data sets for human processing, may increasingly benefit from the capabilities of GenAI.},

  abstract={The recent advances in Generative Artificial In-telligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant interest across the world. For a successful adoption of GenAI and LLMs by industry, it is critical to identify their potential benefits, impact, and challenges. Accordingly, in this work, we investigate a few use cases of LLMs, which are relevant across most industry segments. In order to empirically evaluate the impact of GenAI on the code generation use case, we build CodePrompt, a handcrafted dataset of sequential prompts used by a human user to generate code. We approximate efficiency by considering the ratio of the number of tokens of code generated by an LLM to the number of tokens in the user's prompt. Experimental results reveal that a sequential trial of prompts for code generation may lead to an efficiency factor of about 6.33, on average, which means that a user's effort is reduced to about one-sixth.},

  abstract={With the growing popularity of generative AI for images, video, and music, we witnessed models rapidly improve in quality and performance. However, not much attention is paid towards enabling AI’s ability to “be creative”. We often attribute the quality of “being creative” to an individual or an object, but we believe that countless variables participate in determining what or who is creative, transcending a single entity or artifact. Csikszentmihalyi’s systems model of creativity suggests that creativity is a product of interactions among multiple parts of a society that create, evaluate, and record. In this study, we implemented and simulated Csikszentmihalyi’s systems model of creativity using virtual agents utilizing large language models (LLMs) and text prompts. We conducted experiments in virtual settings where creativity is achieved with the presence of specific characteristics in the artifact. For comparison, the simulations were conducted with two “virtual artists” being 1)in the system, which received feedback from the field, and 2)isolated, which did not. Both agents were compared by analyzing the novelty, which was measured via Creativity Implication Network, and value, quantified through the desired characteristics present in artifacts. Our results suggest that the agents that receive feedback from the field can generate artifacts that are more novel and more valuable, thus more creative, in the framework of the systems model of creativity. Furthermore, the difference becomes more evident when external factors enact changes to the domain.},

  year={2025},

  abstract={The integration of federated learning (FL) with the Internet of Things (IoT) represents an advanced technological trend, combining the extensive connectivity of IoT with the powerful processing capabilities of FL to drive innovation and optimization across multiple domains. Given the heterogeneity of IoT devices and the variability in data distribution, developing strategies to enhance FL performance without overly burdening resource-constrained devices is crucial. This article proposes an FL algorithm based on generative artificial intelligence (GAI) for IoT devices with extreme heterogeneity in data and resources. The algorithm utilizes pretrained GAI models to generate new data, aligning the data distributions of individual IoT devices closer to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), thereby effectively reducing the heterogeneity of local data. Additionally, the proposed algorithm incorporates data synthesis and resource scheduling strategies to mitigate the heterogeneity of local device resources. Finally, we formulate a joint optimization problem aimed at minimizing total energy consumption while maximizing FL performance. Experimental results demonstrate that, under significant resource and data distribution disparities, most existing solutions struggle to converge, whereas the proposed method converges and achieves superior performance. Compared to existing GAI-based approaches, our method significantly reduces latency and energy consumption.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have risen to prominence due to their unparalleled ability to craft and generate digital assets, encompassing text, images, audio, video, and 3D models. Leveraging the capabilities of diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion and Instruct pix2pix, users can guide AI with specific prompts, streamlining the creative journey for graphic designers. However, the primary application of these models has been to graphic content within desktop interfaces, prompting professionals in interior and architectural design to seek more tailored solutions for their daily operations. To bridge this gap, Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) technologies offer a promising solution, transforming traditional 2D artworks into engaging 3D interactive realms. In this paper, we present "Dream Mesh," a MR application MR tool that combines a Speech-to-3D generative workflow besed on DreamFusion model without relying on pre-existing 3D content libraries. This innovative system empowers users to express 3D content needs through natural language input, promising transformative potential in real-time 3D content creation and an enhanced MR user experience.},

  abstract={The music industry has seen significant growth in recent years. This growth can be attributed to a high demand of new music; music streaming apps such as Spotify, Soundcloud, Apple Music, etc. which help people discover artists and bands from all over the world; growth in the film industry which uses music in the form of sound effects and soundtracks to set the tone and help the audience feel a range of emotions; and increase in usage of social media apps such as Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch etc. To meet this surge in the demand of music, music needs to be composed. Composing music is a complex task which involves taking into consideration harmony, rhythm, texture, and structure. This paper aims to shed light on the various ways music can be composed using artificial intelligence. We look at different architectures of neural networks such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs), Autoencoders, General Adversarial Networks (GANs) and transformers to understand which architecture contributes substantially to the process of composition. We also examine the different datasets used to see how the dataset that a model is trained on affects the composition capabilities of a model as well as different evaluation metrics that can be used to evaluate the composed music.},

  abstract={With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is becoming increasingly important in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). At the same time, large language models (LLMs) and generative AI (GenAI) are gradually playing significant roles in the IoV. Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are models capable of integrating multiple modalities of information, enhancing the environmental perception capabilities of the IoV. GenAI can generate highly complex virtual driving scenarios, which are used to test and optimize intelligent driving algorithms, reducing the risks and costs of real-world road testing. Embodied AI can interact with the environment and make decisions, and can learn in the simulated environments that are provided by GenAI. To address issues like low correlation of multimodal data, high-uncertainty of driving environment, and insufficient intelligence in the IoV, this article proposes a perception and decision-making system empowered by embodied AI. First, we utilize a transformer to achieve multimodal data fusion integrated with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) data. Second, the MLLM analyzes the situation based on driving intentions, communication conditions, and the perceived environmental expressions. Finally, the MLLM makes the optimal decisions and adjustments based on the analysis. The experimental results show that the integration of V2V enables the IoV to more comprehensively perceive a complex driving environment. The MLLM can empower the IoV to make accurate decisions in high-uncertainty scenarios, significantly improving route completion rates.},

  abstract={In a highly competitive context where generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools are gaining increasing relevance in educational learning environments, it is essential to understand the motivations and factors driving graduate students to adopt these technologies. This study systematically identifies the factors influencing graduate students’ intentions to use GAI tools. Students and alumni from a graduate business school in Peru were surveyed to assess their intentions regarding GAI technology usage. The study builds on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by incorporating GAI literacy as a variable. In late 2024, 251 participants from diverse backgrounds completed a questionnaire, which was then analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) through SmartPLS 4.1.0.2. This analysis aimed to uncover key factors influencing GAI adoption in higher education. The findings reveal that performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), and perceived risk (PR) significantly influence the intention to use GAI, whereas facilitating conditions (FC) and social influence (SI) do not. Furthermore, prior experience with GAI moderates the relationships between FC, SI, and the intention to use GAI. These insights into the factors shaping GAI adoption intentions are vital for informing strategies to ethically leverage artificial intelligence (AI) in business and academia. By understanding user motivations, organizations can develop targeted policies and training programs to ensure responsible AI integration and maximize its potential benefits.},

  abstract={Fundus images play a crucial role in diagnosing ocular and systemic vascular diseases in clinical settings. However, these images often suffer from issues like uneven brightness and transmission distortion, which adversely impact their quality. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach called the Probability Conditional Guidance Generative Adversarial Network (PCGGAN). This method leverages the high-frequency components of the images to enhance their quality. The hypothesis behind this approach is that retaining the content and pathological information associated with the high-frequency components is vital during the enhancement process. To achieve this, the fundus image is decomposed into high-frequency and low-frequency components, with the high-frequency components probabilistically used as conditional guidance during model training. This training strategy enables the model to learn the distinctions between unconditional and conditional constraints, thereby enhancing its capability for targeted generation and generalization. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through both quantitative and qualitative experiments.},

  abstract={The use of biomedical images for the training of various Deep Learning (DL) systems oriented to health has reported a competitive performance. However, DL needs a large number of images for a correct generalization and, particularly in the case of biomedical images, these can be scarce. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as Data Augmenting tools have reaped significant results to improve performance in tasks that involve the use of this kind of image. However, the architectural design of these generative models in the biomedical image area has been usually relegated to the expertise of researchers. Moreover, GANs are affected by training instability that may lead to poor quality results. This paper presents a neuroevolution algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization for the design and training of GANs for the generation of biomedical Chest X-Ray (CXR) images of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. The proposed approach allows having a swarm of GANs topologies, where each one of them grows progressively while being trained at the same time. The fitness value is based on the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). The proposed algorithm is able to obtain better FID results compared to handcrafted GANs for the synthesis of CXR images.},

  pages={14-29},
  abstract={Spectrum management and resource allocation (RA) problems are challenging and critical in a vast number of research areas such as wireless communications and computer networks. The traditional approaches for solving such problems usually consume time and memory, especially for large-size problems. Recently different machine learning approaches have been considered as potential promising techniques for combinatorial optimization problems, especially the generative model of the deep neural networks. In this work, we propose a resource allocation deep autoencoder network, as one of the promising generative models, for enabling spectrum sharing in underlay device-to-device (D2D) communication by solving linear sum assignment problems (LSAPs). Specifically, we investigate the performance of three different architectures for the conditional variational autoencoders (CVAE). The three proposed architecture are the convolutional neural network (CVAE-CNN) autoencoder, the feed-forward neural network (CVAE-FNN) autoencoder, and the hybrid (H-CVAE) autoencoder. The simulation results show that the proposed approach could be used as a replacement of the conventional RA techniques, such as the Hungarian algorithm, due to its ability to find solutions of LASPs of different sizes with high accuracy and very fast execution time. Moreover, the simulation results reveal that the accuracy of the proposed hybrid autoencoder architecture outperforms the other proposed architectures and the state-of-the-art DNN techniques.},

  abstract={Multispectral image matching is at the base for many remote sensing and computer vision applications. Due to the different imaging principles and spectra, there are significant nonlinear variations in intensity, texture, and style in multispectral images. This makes it difficult for many classic methods designed for the images of the same spectrum to achieve satisfactory matching performance. To cope with this problem, this letter proposes a new method based on image transfer and local feature for multispectral image matching. First, we propose a new regularized conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) for image transfer to preprocess the multispectral images. This step eliminates the differences in grayscale, texture, and style between the multispectral images. Then, we use a classic local feature to match the generated and original images. We evaluate our method on two commonly used data sets and compare with several state-of-the-art methods. The experiments show that our method performs well by significantly improving the matching accuracy and robustness, and slightly increasing the runtime.},

  abstract={This study delves into a comprehensive analysis and identification of potential vocal cues influencing the perception of authenticity versus artificiality in speech. Our primary aim is to pinpoint the pivotal parameters distinguishing genuine voices from artificially synthesized ones. Employing a multifaceted approach, we leverage advanced methodologies encompassing spectral analysis of speech signals, discernment of prosodic patterns, and the application of cutting-edge machine learning techniques such as Hifi-GAN and generative AI. By examining voice data sourced from diverse origins, our aim is to uncover pivotal markers that impact the perception of truthfulness or artificiality in voices, ultimately constructing a predictive model capable of reliably distinguishing between authentic and artificially crafted voices across both pathological and non-pathological conditions. The culmination of this research holds significant implications not only for advancing the scientific and technological understanding of human voice distinctiveness but also for practical applications in healthcare and security domains. Indeed, in the healthcare field the ability to discern authentic voices from artificial ones could facilitate more accurate diagnosis and monitoring of conditions affecting speech, such as neurodegenerative diseases or vocal cord disorders. Additionally, in security contexts, this research could enhance the reliability of voice-based authentication systems, thereby bolstering the integrity of sensitive communications and data transmission. This could pave the way for advancements in security protocols, healthcare applications, and bolstering the reliability of voice-based technologies.},

  abstract={Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) aims to transfer the knowledge from a large teacher network to a lightweight student network without accessing the original training data. However, existing DFKD methods face the issue of distribution shift during data synthesis, which leads to a decline in knowledge distillation. To address this issue, we propose a data-free knowledge distillation method (CCD) based on contrastive inversion (CI) and cluster alignment (CA). Specifically, CI enables the generative network to better capture relevant features and efficiently synthesize images that conforms to the original training data. However, using CI alone can severely reduce the diversity of synthesis images, which may lead to poor performance of the student network. Thus, we propose CA to assure the generative network can learn not only intra-class feature but also the inter-class feature to alleviate the diversity issue. The experiments on various dataset show that our proposed method outperform other baseline methods.},

To be more specific, the encoder-decoder structured generator is used to learn a pose disentangled face representation, and the encoder-decoder structured discriminator is tasked to perform real/fake classification, face reconstruction, determining identity and estimating face pose. We further improve the proposed network architecture by minimizing the additional pixel-wise loss defined by the Wasserstein distance at the output of the discriminator so that the adversarial framework can be better trained. Additionally, we consider face pose variation to be continuous, rather than discrete in existing literature, to inject richer pose information into our model. The pose estimation task is formulated as a regression problem, which helps to disentangle identity information from pose variations. The proposed network is evaluated on the tasks of pose-invariant face recognition (PIFR) and face synthesis across poses. An extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation carried out on several controlled and in-the-wild benchmarking datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed DED-GAN method over the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence tools are capturing the attention of the public and business since the introduction of ChatGPT. While this technology offers many productivity tools, their accessibility to screen reader users is little studied. Most of the technical and professional communication research about these tools focuses on their applied potential. This paper reports the findings of a mixed methods study on the user interfaces of three websites on which GenAI tools reside and the accessibility of their web editors. Studying the accessibility of these firms’ websites and their builder platforms is important because without accessibility features, blind customers cannot access these tools and create websites. This study found that none of the three builder websites, or the web editors for their tools, had WCAG 2.1 level AA accessibility. To improve these tools’ accessibility and usability, these website builders will need to invest resources to develop accessibility knowhow on web development and AI. Involvement of disabled users as co-designers and testers is essential to ensure accessibility in this AI infrastructure. This paper contributes 21 best practices for designing accessible interfaces for generative AI tools.},

  abstract={This paper presents two pedagogical approaches for teaching in the era of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), using case studies from mathematics and computer science. As Generation Z and Alpha have grown up immersed in technology, their learning styles differ significantly from previous generations, creating challenges for traditional instructional methods. While digital platforms provide flexibility, accessibility, and interactivity, the rapid advancement of generative AI adds new layers of complexity. These AI tools enhance self-learning and problem-solving but also raise concerns about ethical usage and conceptual depth. Building on existing research, we introduce two methods: one based on a “learning how to learn” approach in mathematics, which emphasizes mathematical reasoning and problem interpretation over procedural mastery, and another for integrating AI into computer science to support problem-solving, software development, and data-driven decision-making. Preliminary results suggest that students using these approaches demonstrate a stronger ability to leverage AI responsibly, critically assess its outputs, and apply it across disciplines. These findings highlight the need for curriculum adaptations that foster critical thinking, ethical awareness, and adaptability in the AI-driven future.},

We then analyze and compare the models' performance by applying some statistical methods (dimension-wise average and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and two machine learning tasks (association rule mining and prediction). The comprehensive analysis of this study shows that the proposed model is more efficient in generating realistic synthetic data than those generated using medGAN.},

Ensuring the accuracy and security of data transmission is paramount to prevent false alarms and maintain the overall reliability of WBANs. In response to these challenges, we propose a cutting-edge solution, the WBAN-GAN model. This innovative approach integrates a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to assist in the detection of anomalies within WBANs. We have employed a convolutional neural network with a lookback in the data to design our generator and discriminator to explore the spatiotemporal correlations in detecting anomalies. In this work, we fully utilize the outputs of both the generator and discriminator in identifying anomalies by calculating the anomaly score using reconstruction error and discriminator output. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done using GANs for anomaly detection in WBANs. To validate the efficacy of our WBAN-GAN model, we conducted extensive testing using the MIMIC dataset [11]. Comparative analysis with a CNN-Autoencoder-based anomaly detection model demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed approach.

One of the most efficient strategies is maintenance scheduling by predictive maintenance for early fault detection and assisting with real-time decisions. The major concern of developing a predictive maintenance system is the lack of abnormal data and the cost of a high-specification sensor device for collecting data. This paper introduces the unsupervised learning model called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating abnormal data in the form of acceleration signals to provide a dataset for developing an early fault prediction model and assisting a real-time decision on a low-frequency sensor device. The prediction model dataset is labeled on IS010816 to classify the label of data by Velocity Vibration (mm/s). The machine learning classifier model implements a hyperparameters optimization framework called OPTUNA to provide the best model performance. The proposed system aims to assist in real-time decision and maintenance schedules for the injection molding machine and offer the prediction model based on low-frequency sensor data from a drive motor.},

  abstract={Recently, most existing single image dehazing methods adopt the physical scattering model to generate clear images. The model variables are often estimated by trainable neural networks. However, estimating the variables heavily rely on dataset that usually does not take into account of the physical process induced by the scattering model. In this scheme, error accumulation cannot be avoided when applying the end-to-end methods. In this paper, we propose a physical constraint generative adversarial network (PHC-GAN) for single image dehazing. The PHC-GAN is a physics aware model that leveraging the physical scattering process as an additional constraint. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first introducing physical constraint in learning an end-to-end image dehazing model. Our proposed model not only effectively reduce the error accumulation, but can be well adapted in complex and realistic natural scenes compared to the existing methods. In detail, we realize the physical constraint in terms of a double discriminator architecture. The self-attention module is also utilized to guarantee fast convergence. In experiments, quantitative and qualitative results on both synthetic and natural images demonstrate that PHC-GAN is superior to state-of-the-art dehazing methods.},

Compared with the endeavors for super-resolution in image processing, music signals require supper-resolution to improve their quality or adapt to communication in narrow-band channel, which is also regarded as bandwidth expansion. To this end, we shed light on super-resolution for music signals using the deep learning strategy of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The proposed approach feeds Shot-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) features of low-band signals to the GAN, expecting to obtain their high-band information through jointly considering content and adversarial losses. Then, we carry out experiments on MUSDB18 dataset using mixtures of music sources, in order to show the performance of the proposed approach. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach achieves better super-resolution performances compared with interpolation and some conventional deep-learning strategies.},

  abstract={To address the problems that existing recognition networks rely on a large amount of labeled data and the perceptual field is limited to the local area of convolution, and the lack of understanding of contextual information, this paper proposes a self-attentive semantic segmentation method based on generative adversarial networks. The method is based on generating adversarial networks, constructing semantic segmentation networks and discriminators, where the semantic segmentation network uses Resnet101 as the backbone to connect the spatial pyramid pooling module of PSPNet and adopts the cross-attention method in order to overcome the problem of too many parameters of classical attention models. The model was simulated in the publicly available PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and the results showed that the MIoU of the model reached 73.1%, 74.4%, and 75.1% for 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 with labels, respectively, in the first semi-supervised experiments without improving the segmentation network compared to the control group, which were 3.6%, 2.3%, and 1.3% higher, respectively.

  abstract={In the process of acquiring medical images, the quality of the acquired medical images may be poor due to various reasons, thus leading to the doctor's wrong judgement of the patient's condition. In order to solve the problem of unclear texture and blurred edges in medical image storage, an improved generative adversarial network for super-resolution reconstruction of medical images is proposed. Inspired by the Res2Net network, the generator of SRGAN is improved and a multi-scale feature fusion module is designed as the backbone feature extraction network of the generator. This module represents the image multiscale features at the granularity level and expands the receptive field of each network layer to fully extract the feature information of the image. Meanwhile, the EMA attention is embedded into the multiscale feature fusion module, which improves the ability of the model to process features and enhances the feature representation by reorganising the dimensionality of the channels and the batch dimensions, and using the interaction of the different dimensions to capture the connection between image pixels. The results show that at a magnification of 4, this paper's method has better results in objective evaluation criteria compared to SRResNet and SRGAN. It can be seen that the algorithm in this paper can enhance the texture details of medical images and obtain better visual effects.},

  abstract={In response to the substantial threat that Internet attacks pose to data center network security, researchers have proposed several deep learning-based methods for detecting network intrusions. However, while algorithms are constantly improving in terms of accuracy, their stability in the face of insufficient attack samples is a major obstacle. To solve the issues of insufficient attack samples and low detection accuracy in network intrusion detection, this paper proposes a deep confidence network intrusion detection method G-DBN based on GAN. The model is based on the malicious sample extension of the generative adversarial network, and it can produce adversarial samples using malicious network flows as original samples. Furthermore, this paper uses deep belief network technology to create and assess the efficacy of the G-DBN model in detecting network attacks, comparing it to standard DBN models and other network intrusion detection techniques. Experimental results show that compared to the standard three-layer DBN method, the G-DBN method described in this paper improves the detection accuracy of attack samples by 6.46% and better meets the performance requirements of current practical applications.},

Cross-domain information can help solve the problem of insufficient training samples. Cross-domain classification problem is discussed in this paper. In the problem, one scene with sufficient labeled samples is called source scene, and the other with limited training samples is called target scene. However, due to the changes in the imaging condition, the source scene and the target scene usually contain different feature distributions. This paper proposes a heterogeneous transfer learning method for cross-domain hyperspectral image classification based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). The method consists of two submodules: classification submodule composed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and scene alignment submodule that helps in reducing the domain shift between different datasets with a generator and a discriminator. The experimental results on two cross-domain hyperspectral image datasets reveal the excellent competitiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks (DNN) are widely used in various fields and get great success, but one of the major challenges is interpretable mechanism of DNN model. In order to break through the limitations of current deep learning, especially for the interpretability problem of DNN models, we will give a physics-based interpretation of the DNN model in this work. Due to the relationship among autoencoder, minimum description length, mutual information, Ising model, renormalization group etc and free energy principle in deep learning, the energy-based learning framework provides some solid foundations for interpretable DNN model. Therefore, based on the least action principle, the interpretation for generative models using physics principle is presented, and the interpretability problem of DNN model is investigated. Our proposed Synergetic Learning Systems (SLS) is an artificial intelligence (AI) system with multiple subsystems. Here we take two-model SLS, one is the reductive model and another is evolutionary model, as an example to illuminate the interpretability of the DNN models. This work is significant as it offers a clear physical perspective on interpretable DNNs, paves the road for the development of physical artificial intelligence, and prompts development of Science for AI greatly.},

  abstract={Learning performance data, such as correct or incorrect answers and problem-solving attempts in intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs), facilitate the assessment of knowledge mastery and the delivery of effective instructions. However, these data tend to be highly sparse (80%$\sim$90% missing observations) in most real-world applications. This data sparsity presents challenges to using learner models to effectively predict learners' future performance and explore new hypotheses about learning. This article proposes a systematic framework for augmenting learning performance data to address data sparsity. First, learning performance data can be represented as a 3-D tensor with dimensions corresponding to learners, questions, and attempts, effectively capturing longitudinal knowledge states during learning. Second, a tensor factorization method is used to impute missing values in sparse tensors of collected learner data, thereby grounding the imputation on knowledge tracing (KT) tasks that predict missing performance values based on real observations. Third, data augmentation using generative artificial intelligence models, including generative adversarial network (GAN), specifically vanilla GANs and generative pretrained transformers (GPTs, specifically GPT-4o), generate data tailored to individual clusters of learning performance. We tested this systemic framework on adult literacy datasets from AutoTutor lessons developed for adult reading comprehension. We found that tensor factorization outperformed baseline KT techniques in tracing and predicting learning performance, demonstrating higher fidelity in data imputation, and the vanilla GAN-based augmentation demonstrated greater overall stability across varying sample sizes, whereas GPT-4o-based augmentation exhibited higher variability, with occasional cases showing closer fidelity to the original data distribution. This framework facilitates the effective augmentation of learning performance data, enabling controlled, cost-effective approach for the evaluation and optimization of ITS instructional designs in both online and offline environments prior to deployment, and supporting advanced educational data mining and learning analytics.},

  abstract={Sentiment analysis is considered as an important study where be able to automatically extract the polarity of consumers or users' opinions and use it as important data for decision-making in companies or organizations. It has further developed into Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis research that predicts the polarity for a specific aspect within a sentence. Recently, research has been conducted to convert emotion analysis based on classification work to a model that obtains more diverse and accurate emotion expressions using generative language models. We propose a method of fine-tuning by introducing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into a generative language model to improve the performance of these generative-based ABSA models and enable efficient learning. In this paper, GloABSA (GPT2+LoRA Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis) aims at improving the learning efficiency of the previously proposed GPTABSA model. In this study, LoRA is introduced and fine-tuned to the GPT2 model to predict aspects and polarities using enhanced contextual information, and to reduce the number of parameters to enable efficient learning. Experiments using a benchmark dataset of ABSA, let us show that our proposed method outperforms previous studies and significantly reduces the number of parameters.},

  pages={249-253},
  abstract={This study investigates the division of labor between students and generative AI in solving tasks addressing critical thinking. Three key research interests guide the study: (1) the extent of ChatGPT usage by students, (2) the division of labour between student and AI as perceived by students, ChatGPT, and an expert, and (3) if these ratings align with each other. An experiment involving 20 undergraduate students who completed 11 tasks using ChatGPT was carried out. Findings demonstrated substantial variation in the extent of ChatGPT usage among students. The division of labour analysis revealed that ChatGPT is used most heavily for reasoning tasks, and that students consistently rated the AI's contribution to their task solutions as slightly lower than both ChatGPT and the expert. Correlations of the ratings indicated strong alignment between students and ChatGPT, but weaker alignment with the expert perspective, particularly in the metacognition domain. These results highlight the need for enhanced integration of AI in educational practices, focusing on fostering students' understanding of AI capabilities while promoting critical engagement. Future research should explore diverse populations, a broader range of task types, and the long-term impact of AI integration to enhance the effective use of generative AI in education.},

  title={Believe in Artificial Intelligence? A User Study on the ChatGPT’s Fake Information Impact}, 
  year={2024},

  abstract={Technological evolution has enabled the development of new artificial intelligence (AI) models with generative capabilities. Among them, one of the most discussed is the virtual agent ChatGPT. This chatbot may occasionally produce fake information, as also declared by the producer OpenAI. Such a model may provide very useful support in several tasks, ranging from text summarization to programming. The research community has marginally investigated the impact that fake information created by AI models has on the users’ perceptions and on their belief in AI. We analyzed the impact of the fake information produced by AI on user perceptions, specifically trust and satisfaction, by performing a user study on ChatGPT. An additional issue is assessing whether the early or late knowledge of the possibility of the tool generating fake information has a different impact on the users’ perceptions. We conducted an experiment, involving 62 university students, a category of users who may employ tools such as ChatGPT extensively. The experiment consisted of a guided interaction with ChatGPT. Some of the participants experienced the failure of the chatbot, while a control group only received correct and reliable answers. We collected participants’ perceptions of trust, satisfaction, and usability, together with the net promoter score (NPS). The results demonstrated a statistically significant difference in trust and satisfaction between the users who early experienced fake information production compared to those who discovered ChatGPT’s faulty behaviors later during the interaction. Also, there is no statistically significant difference among the users who received the late fake information and the control group (no fake information). Usability and the NPS also resulted higher when the fake news was detected in the late interaction. When users are aware of the fake information generated by ChatGPT their trust and satisfaction decrease, especially when they impact on this at the early stage of use of the chatbot. Nevertheless, the perception of trust and satisfaction still remains high, as some of the users are still enthusiastic; others consider a more conscious use of the tool in terms of support to be verified. A useful strategy could be to favor a critical use of ChatGPT, letting young people to verify the provided information. This should be a new way to perform learning activities.},

  abstract={Amongst many life-threatening conditions, a fatal condition is the Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). It may result in death if not treated immediately and hence necessitates the need for accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. In recent times, concepts of Artificial intelligence (AI), have emerged as a transformative tool in medical image processing, offering faster and more reliable ICH detection and classification. This research study reviews the current advancements in AI-driven biomedical image processing for ICH, exploring various state-of-the-art models involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), variants of CNN with more efficient feature extraction procedures, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and optimization methods like Genetic Algorithms (GA), Ant Colony Model (ACO), rParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Additionally, challenges such as data scarcity, model interpretability, and generalization across diverse populations are discussed. The paper highlights future research directions, including the need for explainable AI, multimodal data integration, and real-time, low-cost AI solutions for resourceconstrained environments. By addressing these challenges, AI has the potential to revolutionize ICH detection and improve patient outcomes globally.},

  abstract={The importance of Radio Access Network (RAN) in support Artificial Intelligence (AI) application services has grown significantly, underscoring the need for an integrated approach that considers not only network efficiency but also AI performance. In this paper we focus on a semantic generative communication (SGC) framework for image inpainting application. Specifically, the transmitter sends semantic information, i.e., semantic masks and textual descriptions, while the receiver utilizes a conditional diffusion model on a base image, using them as conditioning data to produce the intended image. In this framework, we propose a bandwidth allocation scheme designed to maximize bandwidth efficiency while ensuring generation performance. This approach is based on our finding of a “Semantic Deadline”-the minimum time that conditioning data is required to be injected to meet a given performance threshold-within the multi-modal SGC framework. Given this observation, the proposed scheme allocates limited bandwidth so that each semantic information can be transmitted within the corresponding semantic deadline. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed bandwidth allocation scheme achieves higher generation performance in terms of PSNR for a given bandwidth compared to traditional schemes that do not account for semantic deadlines.},

  abstract={Micro-computed tomography (CT) imagining is an advanced technology that has been commonly adapted to scan three-dimensional images of small animals and small structures. Micro CT has a wide variety of applications in medical science, medical research, material science, etc. Micro CT provides low-dose scanning to ensure that the scanning material is safe and the radiation explosion is low. Although it is a low-dose scanning method, the quality of the scanned image will be somewhat degraded. In the specialized domain of image processing, we see enormous triumph in the regions of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) as well, with the capacity to deal with even the most difficult operations like reconstruction, enhancement, segmentation, etc. The main aim of this literature survey is to study the existing AI-based approaches like the convolutional neural network (CNN), generative adversarial network (GAN), AutoEncoders, etc for the enhancement of micro CT images and to compare the features of different models.
