  abstract={Advancements in smartphone technology have led to an increase in the usage of various location-based services (LBS). This resulted in a lot of trajectory data being generated. LBSs provide personalized services for users through continuous queries. However, there is a problem that the user’s sensitive information can be inferred through such continuous queries. Although various methods have been proposed to protect personal information, traditional personal information protection methods cannot provide absolute personal information protection when user location information itself, such as LBS, is required. In particular, if sensitive points visited by the user are exposed, this may lead to additional information leakage. Therefore, this paper guarantees anonymity by protecting sensitive points visited by users through the class conditional synthesis of ACGAN, and proposes a synthetic trajectory generation model for generating highly useful trajectory data through the combination of attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the usability and anonymity aspects of the synthetic trajectory data generated by the proposed are compared with those of existing models to verify the performance of the proposed.},

  abstract={With increasing requirements for reliability, availability, efficiency, effectiveness, productivity, and security of the system, the importance of diagnostics and maintenance is also increasing. E-maintenance as a leading concept for maintenance management has so far primarily involved the use of domain-specific technical language processing (TLP) techniques on historical case data. Due to its popularity, generative AI (GAI) with large language models (LLMs) is starting to be used more and more in various technical areas, thus starting to take an increasingly important place in diagnostics and maintenance. Starting from the fact that the rapid development of information and communication technologies (ICT) was the main factor in the emergence and development of the concept of e-maintenance, the importance of the potential more serious application of all forms of generative AI in the context is clear. This is especially pronounced in cases of difficult or impossible access to the location of components or an uncertain situation related to the type of process (e.g., nuclear, aeronautical, space, offshore). Autonomous vehicles, vessels, and aircraft (as an indispensable part of today’s intelligent transport systems) are certainly a leading example of these cases. Regardless of the level of autonomy, these systems are extremely complex and difficult to maintain and represent a clear challenge for the application of new approaches. Therefore, the authors of the paper propose the use of middleware that would enable the integration of various GAI tools, algorithms, and models to increase the effectiveness of diagnostics and maintenance as close as possible to real-time. However, the exact extent of the possibilities and limitations of this approach has yet to be determined.},

  abstract={Due to the high acoustic variability, children speech recognition suffers significant performance reduction on most ASR systems which are optimized mainly using adults speech with limited or even none children speech. One of the most straight ideas to solve this problem is to increase the children's speech data during training, however, it is restricted by the more difficult process and higher cost when collecting children's speech compared to adults'. In this work, we develop a generative adversarial network (GANs) based data augmentation method to increase the size of children's training data to improve speech recognition performance for children's speech. Two different types of GANs are explored under WGAN-GP training framework, including the unconditional GANs with an unsupervised learning framework and the conditional GANs using acoustic states as conditions. The proposed data augmentation approaches are evaluated on a Mandarin speech recognition task, with only 40-hour children speech or further including 100-hour adult speech in the training. The results show that more than relative 20% WER reduction can be obtained on children speech testset with the proposed method, and the generated children speech with GAN even can improve the adults' speech within our experimental setups.},

  abstract={This research paper aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of AI bots in simulating human subjects for research purposes. In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has gained significant attention. While most approaches explore possibilities for teaching and learning, the possibilities for human subject research have been under-explored. By utilizing AI bots as a tool for data collection and analysis, researchers can potentially reduce costs, increase efficiency, and improve overall accuracy in their studies. This project focused on replicating a traditional qualitative research study on the topic of “humility in engineering“ with real human subjects in a simulated study using several publicly available generative AI tools - ChatGPT, Gemini, DebateAI, MasterDebater - to evaluate the effectiveness of AI bots as simulators of human subject research. The project assessed the “personalities“ and response patterns of AI tools leading to ethical implications of using AI bots as research simulators. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness and ethical implications of AI bots as simulators of human subject research, the project also explored the potential benefits and limitations of this approach. Overall, this project represents an important step towards understanding the role of AI bots in research and their potential impact on the engineering education research community. By evaluating the use of AI bots as simulators of human subject research, researchers can gain valuable insights into the benefits, limitations, and ethical considerations of this approach. Ultimately, this project seeks to advance the field of research methodology and contribute to the ongoing dialogue surrounding the use of AI in scientific studies.},

  year={2023},

  number={},
  pages={2751-2765},
  abstract={As a promising technique of resisting steganalysis detection, generative steganography usually generates a new image driven by secret information as the stego-image. However, it generally encodes secret information as entangled features in a non-distribution-preserving manner for the stego-image generation, which leads to two common issues: 1) limited accuracy of information extraction, and 2) low security in the feature-domain. To address the above limitations, we propose a generative steganographic framework via auto-generation of semantic object contours, in which a given secret message is encoded as the disentangled features, i.e., object-contours, in a distribution-preserving manner for the stego-image generation. In this framework, we propose a contour generative adversarial nets (CtrGAN) consisting of a contour-generator and a contour-discriminator, which are adversarially trained with reinforcement learning. To realize the generative steganography, by using the contour-generator of the trained CtrGAN, a contour point selection (CPS)-based encoding strategy is designed to encode the secret message as the contours. Then, the BicycleGAN is employed to transform the generated contours to the corresponding stego-image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed steganographic approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of information extraction accuracy, especially under common image attacks, and feature-domain security.},

Our comparative analysis focuses on the effectiveness of this integrated method against conventional interview techniques, particularly in revealing less consciously acknowledged aspects of personality. The findings indicate that the use of LSP in combination with AI technologies provides a unique avenue for uncovering deeper, often subconscious, personal insights, as demonstrated by a distinctive pattern in the recognition of extracted keywords between methods. This research highlights the value of blending analog and digital methodologies to access and apply introspective data, offering significant implications for enhancing personal development and understanding.},

  year={2025},

  number={},
  pages={57568-57588},
  abstract={Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity presents a major risk to cancer patients, often leading to severe cardiac complications such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias. Early detection is crucial for preventing long-term damage and improving patient outcomes, yet existing diagnostic methods struggle to effectively capture the complexity of multimodal medical data and often lack interpretability. In this study, we propose an innovative approach that integrates multimodal deep learning with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance early cardiotoxicity detection. Our model combines clinical data (e.g., age and cardiovascular metrics) with Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI), a functional imaging technique that captures myocardial velocity during the cardiac cycle. To overcome data limitations, we employed Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) and Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGANs) to augment the dataset, improving its diversity and balance for better model training. We developed three architectures that integrate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from TDI images with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Transformer models to capture temporal dependencies and enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, we incorporated SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to interpret the contribution of input features, increasing model transparency and clinical applicability. Our Transformer-based model achieved the highest accuracy of 96%, outperforming the GRU (94%) and LSTM (89%) models, significantly surpassing traditional approaches. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based architectures in multimodal deep learning for precise cardiotoxicity prediction, supporting early intervention and personalized treatment strategies while improving interpretability through XAI techniques such as SHAP.},

  abstract={This study employs a design science research approach to propose a foundational information system design theory tailored for generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) applications in the fashion design process. It delineates meta-requirements and design principles that address both the transformative potential of GenAI, and the unique challenges faced by the fashion sector. To validate the practicality of the proposed design theory, a prototype system was developed and evaluated with feedback from 30 experienced fashion practitioners, confirming its feasibility and effectiveness. Insights from case studies conducted with two Hong Kong-based fashion companies further highlight the benefits and challenges of integrating GenAI into fashion design. While GenAI demonstrates promise in enhancing communication, accelerating design processes, and improving customer engagement and satisfaction, key challenges remain, including the need for high-quality datasets, significant computational resources, and ethical considerations related to AI-generated designs. The design principles derived from this study provide a structured guideline for system designers, offering a practical framework for developing GenAI systems that cater to the specific needs of the fashion industry.

Insulators in operation are subjected to all kinds of pollution which may cause the formation of dry bands when in presence of moisture, which leads to the formation of partial discharges which, in turn, causes degradation and aging of the surface material. Partial discharges origin can be identified by the pattern of their pulses.

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized image synthesis by using two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, to create realistic images from random noise. In this adversarial process, the generator attempts to fool the discriminator, which distinguishes between real and fake images. Advanced variants like conditional GANs and CycleGANs enable tasks like specified image generation and style transfer. Our paper presents improvements in image quality and training stability for GANs by introducing new training methods and loss function modifications to address issues like mode collapse. Evaluated on CelebA and CIFAR-10, our model outperforms previous GANs with Inception Scores of 9.69 and 10.79 and Frechet Inception Distances of 7.91 and -9.69, respectively. These results demonstrate better convergence, more stable training, and higher-quality image generation, establishing a new benchmark for GAN research and applications.},

  abstract={In recent years, offline reinforcement learning has attracted considerable attention in artificial intelligence. By generating a static dataset through a behavior policy, it is unable to engage in online interactions with the environment. However, this inevitably leads to states or actions undergoing inherent distribution shifts. To address the above concerns, offline reinforcement learning with generative adversarial networks and uncertainty estimation (GANUE) is proposed. This approach parameterizes the conditional generative adversarial networks and avoids the over-constraint problem that would be introduced when using a distance metric. Estimating the Q-value through ensemble uncertainty not only relaxes the policy constraint strength but also enhances the out-of-distribution generalization ability. The experimental results show that GANUE significantly performs better on the Maze2D and Adroit tasks than multiple baselines. In addition, we perform sensitivity analysis experiments for the parameters of the perturbation model.},

  abstract={At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was significant hype about the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in combatting COVID-19 on diagnosis, prognosis, or surveillance. However, AI tools have not yet been widely successful. One of the key reason is the COVID-19 pandemic has demanded faster real-time development of AI-driven clinical and health support tools, including rapid data collection, algorithm development, validation, and deployment. However, there was not enough time for proper data quality control. Learning from the hard lessons in COVID-19, we summarize the important health data quality challenges during COVID-19 pandemic such as lack of data standardization, missing data, tabulation errors, and noise and artifact. Then we conduct a systematic investigation of computational methods that address these issues, including emerging novel advanced AI data quality control methods that achieve better data quality outcomes and, in some cases, simplify or automate the data cleaning process. We hope this article can assist healthcare community to improve health data quality going forward with novel AI development.},

  abstract={The paper investigates the use of AI in power systems to improve monitoring, control, and optimization. For successful classification tasks on various datasets, ML models are critical, boosting power system dependability and efficiency. The research focuses on ML model designs in AI-driven power systems for binary, triple, and multiclass classification. Misclassifications can destabilize grid stability, underlining the importance of precise classification in decision-making processes. To combat this, this research proposes a DNN model that uses specific parameters that were fine-tuned for greater accuracy in classification tasks. Model correctness is an important performance metric that can be improved by architecture design and fine-tuning. For successful optimization, three essential loss functions (binary cross-entropy, categorical cross-entropy, and sparse categorical cross-entropy) are investigated. We have achieved great results with utilizing the sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function to minimize the error during training periods. The study underscores the critical relevance of correct categorization and the possibility for robust AI applications in power systems, which contribute to grid stability and sustainability.},

  abstract={Automatic strip steel surface defect detection is a difficult mission, as a result of the imbalanced class distributions caused by the sparse distribution of abnormal samples. The one-class classification (OCC) method can detect abnormal samples by only training the normal samples. The Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) can automatically learn the features of samples in unsupervised situations, and only one sample is used to train the model. The GAN-based one-class classification method for strip steel surface defects detection is proposed in the paper. The second to last output layer of GAN generator is chosen as the feature, which contains some basic and important information about the sample. In addition, an improved loss function is proposed to raise the stability of the model and the convergence speed. Then the one-class classifier can easily detect abnormal samples by comparing the feature of normal samples and abnormal samples. The proposed approach is validated in the strip steel data sets containing surface defect of different size, shape and type. The experiments have shown that the method can reach an average accuracy of 94% in the data sets.},

  abstract={Voice conversion (VC) refers to transforming the speaker characteristics of an utterance without altering its linguistic contents. Many works on voice conversion require to have parallel training data that is highly expensive to acquire. Recently, the cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN), which does not require parallel training data, has been applied to voice conversion, showing the state-of-the-art performance. The CycleGAN based voice conversion, however, can be used only for a pair of speakers, i.e., one-to-one voice conversion between two speakers. In this paper, we extend the CycleGAN by conditioning the network on speakers. As a result, the proposed method can perform many-to-many voice conversion among multiple speakers using a single generative adversarial network (GAN). Compared to building multiple CycleGANs for each pair of speakers, the proposed method reduces the computational and spatial cost significantly without compromising the sound quality of the converted voice. Experimental results using the VCC2018 corpus confirm the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Missing values are very prevalent in real world; they are caused by various reasons such as user mistakes or device failures. They often cause critical problems especially in medical and healthcare application since they can lead to incorrect diagnosis or even cause system failure. Many of recent imputation techniques have adopted machine learning-based generative methods such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) to deal with missing values in medical data. They are, however, incapable of reproducing realistic time-series signals preserving important latent features such as sleep stages that are important context in many medical applications using electroencephalogram (EEG). In this study, we propose a novel GAN-based technique generating realistic EEG signal sequences which are not only shown natural but also correctly classified with sleep stages by implanting the latent features in the synthetic sequence. By experiments, we confirm that our model generates not only more realistic EEG signals than a recent GAN-based model but also preserve auxiliary information such as sleep stages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that existing machine learning methods based on EEG data still work well without sacrificing performance using the imputed data by using our method.},

  abstract={The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), particularly ChatGPT, is reshaping the landscape of supply chain management (SCM) by enabling interactive, real-time, and language-based intelligence. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate on structured data and predefined rules, ChatGPT introduces a conversational interface that supports decision-making, problem-solving, and coordination across various SCM functions. This study examines the adoption of ChatGPT by assessing its alignment with four key supply chain tasks: optimization, adaptability, sustainability, and coordination. To explain the mechanisms driving adoption, we integrate the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) theory with the Stimulus-Organism-Response framework, modeling ChatGPT as a stimulus that influences user trust, satisfaction, and technology anxiety—cognitive and emotional responses that shape behavioral intention. Empirical data were collected from 382 SCM professionals across diverse industries and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. The results demonstrate that perceived TTF significantly enhances trust and satisfaction, both of which have a positive influence on the intention to adopt ChatGPT. Importantly, the study reveals that technology anxiety moderates these relationships, diminishing the strength of trust and satisfaction in driving adoption. This finding highlights the importance of addressing psychological resistance in conjunction with the deployment of technology. By offering a dual-theoretical lens and empirical validation, this research contributes to the emerging literature on Gen-AI adoption, providing actionable insights for practitioners seeking to integrate ChatGPT into their supply chain operations.},

  abstract={Generative AI is rapidly reshaping educational environments, offering transformative possibilities for teaching, learning, and student engagement. As UNESCO DirectorGeneral Audrey Azoulay aptly remarked, “Education will be profoundly transformed by AI.” This transformation impacts not only how knowledge is accessed but also how learning experiences are personalized, how curricula are developed, and how educators are trained. Despite the growing integration of AI tools into education, particularly generative AI, several critical questions remain: How effectively is generative AI being used to support and enhance learning? Are students merely passive recipients of AI-generated content, or are they active participants in more meaningful, personalized learning experiences? What specific generative AI tools are currently being implemented in classrooms, and how do both educators and students perceive their impact and integration? This paper presents the findings of a comprehensive survey conducted at Esprit School of Engineering (ESE) and Esprit School of Business (ESB). The goal is to capture the perspectives of students and teachers on the application and perceived impact of generative AI tools in educational settings. Using a Likert scale, the survey evaluates attitudes toward usability, effectiveness, and the potential of these tools to enhance both teaching and learning outcomes. Additionally, the study explores whether generative AI helps create a more engaging and interactive learning environment. The primary objective of this research is to explore how generative AI is perceived and utilized in classrooms, as well as the barriers and facilitators that affect its adoption. We begin by reviewing the current landscape of generative AI in education, focusing on its most prevalent applications. We then detail the survey methodology and analyze the results, offering insights into both opportunities and challenges posed by these AI tools. Finally, we conclude by discussing the broader implications of our findings and providing recommendations for future AI integration in education.},

  abstract={This innovative practice WIP paper describes a pedagogical approach to use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to promote critical thinking among students in the fields of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC). Technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate, impacting many aspects of human interaction. AEC are among the fields experiencing this rapid technological evolution. Since education in these areas is continuously improving and adapting to new technologies, the motivation behind this study is to explore how GenAI can support the development of critical thinking in AEC. The correct use of GenAI as a tool in education is crucial for ensuring that students benefit from its capabilities while retaining their own analytical skills. Recognizing the potential of this technology in the professional world, this study focuses on college-level students in architecture and civil engineering courses to promote critical thinking skills by using GenAI as a complementary tool to enhance learning experience. Harnessing GenAI to cultivate critical thinking skills among students can enhance their ability to tackle complex problems and adapt to technological advancements. The main objective of this ongoing study is to explore the integration og GenAI into the learning process to foster critical thinking skills. To achieve this, students in AEC courses at the Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ) were introduced to a GenAI application to generate summaries points of specific themes. Then, students were instructed to engage in three rounds of answers-based questioning to further explore the topic from a critical thinking lens. The instructor provided guidance on formulating questions to encourage reflective and critical thinking. Students reported on their interactions, detailing the path of questions and answers and their viewpoints on the assigned topic at the end of the experiment. After the exercise, researchers administered an open-ended survey to gather qualitative information on student's perspective regarding the impact of the GenAI on their learning process and critical thinking development. Data were collected from students of various academic years and AEC specialties, providing insights into their critical thinking development in different contexts. The study also analyzes potential factors influencing the relationship between GenAI use, academic performance and critical thinking in AEC education.},

  abstract={The traditional role of the network layer is the transfer of packet replicas from source to destination through intermediate network nodes. We present a generative network layer that uses Generative AI (GenAI) at intermediate or edge network nodes and analyze its impact on the required data rates in the network. We conduct a case study where the GenAI-aided nodes generate images from prompts that consist of substantially compressed latent representations. The results from network flow analyses under image quality constraints show that the generative network layer can achieve an improvement of more than 100% in terms of the required data rate.},

  abstract={The study aims to improve brainstorming by utilizing Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) to generate more ideas and increase novelty. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the rules and techniques of brainstorming. An experiment was conducted in which Gen AI was added to improve the brainstorming process. The results showed a significant positive correlation between participants' confidence in the information provided by Gen AI and an increase in the number of non-redundant ideas generated by co-ideation. In addition, participants' expectations of co-ideation with Gen AI were significantly positively correlated with an increase in both non-redundant and unique ideas. Gen AI can be an extension of human thinking in brainstorming, leading to improved idea generation. However, the effectiveness of Gen AI depends on the user's attitude towards AI.},

  abstract={Industrial development has changed vehicles of traditional into autonomous vehicles (AVs). AVs play a significant role since they are measured as a vital module of smart cities. The AV is an advanced automobile efficient in preserving secure driving by evading collisions formed by drivers. In contrast with traditional vehicles, which are fully coordinated and functioned by humans, AVs gather information regarding the exterior environment utilizing sensors to guarantee secure navigation. AVs decrease environmental effects since they regularly employ electricity to function rather than fossil fuel, thus diminishing greenhouse gasses. However, AVs might be exposed to cyber-attacks, causing dangers to human life. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based anomaly recognition has progressed as a new study track in autonomous driving. ML and DL-based anomaly detection scholars have focused on improving accuracy as a typical classification task without aiming at mischievous information. This article develops an improved whale optimization algorithm-based feature selection using explainable artificial intelligence for robust anomaly detection (IWOAFS-XAIAD) technique in autonomous driving. The major aim of the IWOAFS-XAIAD technique is an endwise XAI structure to construe and imagine the anomaly recognition classifications prepared by AI models securing autonomous driving systems. Initially, the IWOAFS-XAIAD technique utilizes the Z-score data normalization method to convert input data into a compatible layout. Besides, the IWOAFS-XAIAD technique employs an improved whale optimization algorithm (IWOA)-based feature subset selection to pick an optimum set of features. An attention mechanism with the CNN-BiLSTM (CNN-BiLSTM-A) model is employed for anomaly detection and classification. Moreover, the catch-fish optimization algorithm (CFOA) selects the hyperparameters connected to the CNN-BiLSTM-A model. Finally, utilizing the SHAP XAI method, the IWOAFS-XAIAD technique performs local and global descriptions for the black-box AI model. To demonstrate the optimum classification outcome of the IWOAFS-XAIAD technique, a wide range of experiments is performed on a VeReMi dataset. The experimental validation of the IWOAFS-XAIAD technique portrayed a superior accuracy value of 98.52% over the existing methods.},

  title={Learning Deep Generative Clustering via Mutual Information Maximization}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={34},

  pages={6263-6275},
  abstract={Deep clustering refers to joint representation learning and clustering using deep neural networks. Existing methods can be mainly categorized into two types: discriminative and generative methods. The former learns representations for clustering with discriminative mechanisms directly, and the latter estimate the latent distribution of each cluster for generating data points and then infers cluster assignments. Although generative methods have the advantage of estimating the latent distributions of clusters, their performances still significantly fall behind discriminative methods. In this work, we argue that this performance gap might be partly due to the overlap of data distribution of different clusters. In fact, there is little guarantee of generative methods to separate the distributions of different clusters in the data space. To tackle these problems, we theoretically prove that mutual information maximization promotes the separation of different clusters in the data space, which provides a theoretical justification for deep generative clustering with mutual information maximization. Our theoretical analysis directly leads to a model which integrates a hierarchical generative adversarial network and mutual information maximization. Moreover, we further propose three techniques and empirically show their effects to stabilize and enhance the model. The proposed approach notably outperforms other generative models for deep clustering on public benchmarks.},

  abstract={In recent past Communication has played a key role in the job market and societal norms. Students with better communication skills are academically and technically smart, they communicate and understand their colleagues which creates a holistic work/study environment. The four main divisions of communication skills are LSRW (Listening, speaking, reading and writing). Each and every division is directly or indirectly dependent on each other. Improving these four skills are essential in today’s world. To foster these skills a new model has been proposed which is backed by AI (Artificial Intelligence). After each skill module this model tests a student’s communication skills and generates feedback which shows the interpretation level of the student. This data is given to an AI model which generates questions according to the understanding of each student. Each student gets a unique set of questions according to his/her understanding and interpretation skills. This model coerces a student to engage in advancing their communication skills. It strengthens one’s knowledge in each and every aspect of the communication skill as it has speaking and listening exercises incorporated in it. Hence, we can say that the proposed AI model has a $\mathbf{95\%}$ success rate as it has an optimistic effect in a student’s study and work-related aspects. Since it is easy and effective it can be incorporated in schools, colleges, universities, companies and various other institutions. The implementation of these AI tools shows a generative impact in the above-mentioned institutions.},

  abstract={Seismic data interpolation is an effective way to reconstruct missing seismic traces and to improve the quality of the seismic data set. In the field of deep learning, generative adversarial networks are capable of data generation and interpolation and have been widely used for high-quality image generations and image interpolations. In this letter, we propose a dual-domain conditional generative adversarial network (DD-CGAN) for seismic data interpolation. The DD-CGAN consists of a generator network and a discriminator network and uses the seismic data set and discrete Fourier transformed data set in the frequency domain as input vectors. The loss function of the DD-CGAN is defined by the generative-adversarial loss, the data loss function, and the total variation loss. Thus, the DD-CGAN can be trained more accurately. The discriminator is used to calculate the feature differences between the interpolated seismic data set and the complete seismic data set to drive the generator network for learning optimal parameters. The numerical results on the test data set and field seismic data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DD-CGAN.},

  abstract={The trend of using larger scale antenna arrays will continue toward 6G systems, where the number of antennas will be further scaled up to improve spectral efficiency. However, the increase in the number of antennas will bring new challenges to the physical layer, such as frequent feedback in high-speed mobile communications, multiband coexistence overhead from sub-6 (gigahertz) GHz to terahertz (THz), and energy consumption due to increased antenna components and circuits. In this article, we introduce artificial intelligence (AI)-based channel extrapolation to address these problems. Specifically, we divide the channel extrapolation into time, frequency, and space domains according to different application scenarios. The channel propagation characteristics that affect the extrapolation of each domain, such as the spatial consistency property (SCP), partial reciprocity, and spatial nonstationarity, are analyzed. The motivations for selecting various AI models in each domain are explained, and the performance of AI models is compared. Furthermore, we find the gain of cross-domain channel extrapolation based on transfer learning (TL). The simulation results show that the experience of the AI model cross different domains can be mutually reinforcing. Finally, we introduce several challenges for AI-based channel extrapolation, which can be regarded as potential research directions for realizing future AI-powered 6G systems.},

The amount of medical imaging data to be analysed on daily basis is large and the analysis of such medical image data need expertise in those area. The huge amount of data available can be analysed by using Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is a promising technique that have shown great potential in various aspects of brain image processing, including image segmentation, classification, registration and disease diagnosis. The integration of various AI techniques in brain image processing has the potential to enrich the understanding of brain structure, function and pathology. AI models an assist in automated diagnosis of brain disorders by analysing medical imaging data and can learn the patterns and features indicative of specific brain disorder and classify them accurately. For example AI algorithm has been developed to diagnose disorders like Alzheimer’s disease, Stroke, Epileptic seizures, Parkinson’s disease and Brain tumour. AI algorithm can automatically segment brain images and identify specific biomarkers associated with different brain disorders. This helps in quantifying disease related changes in the brain and tracking disease progression. For instance in Alzheimer’s disease research AI can be used to segment brain structures to identify early signs of the disease.

  abstract={Hypersonic morphing vehicles (HMVs) require multiple landing footprint predictions on decision-making and target allocation. Unlike the traditional hypersonic vehicle, the varying aerodynamic characteristics corresponding to different shapes pose challenges to the landing footprint prediction. This study proposes a rapid landing footprint prediction method for HMV based on the Dual-Generator Wasserstein Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (DG-WCGAN). By leveraging the learning capabilities and computational efficiency of generative artificial intelligence, this method eliminates integral calculations and accurately predicts the landing footprint for the current shape or morphing-enabled situation. First, an aerodynamic parameters and landing footprint database is constructed using aerodynamic simulation software and numerical optimization. Further, the structure of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is tailored by incorporating a dual generator. This enables the one-step computation of aerodynamic parameters and landing footprint and offers the flexibility to adjust the number of generated landing points according to the requirements. Moreover, the extra network can be independently utilized for aerodynamic parameter calculations in HMV control. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed DG-WCGAN method improves computational speed by 21.7% while reducing prediction error by 68.6% compared to the DNN approaches and exhibits better generalization capability.},

  abstract={Educators believe that using technology in education will be more effective for the new generation of learners. Therefore, we propose an educational technology platform called Hakawati that supports educators’ teaching methods and students’ learning skills by utilizing artificial intelligence capabilities based on text-to-speech (TTS) and text generation technologies. For the story-generation component of Hakawati, we employed a pretrained transformer model called Turbo 3.5. This model creates coherent narratives from various prompts, perfectly satisfying the goal of transforming lessons into stories. To ensure the effectiveness of the models, subjective evaluations were conducted using measures, such as relevance, coherence, story completeness, language, and grammar. To convert the generated stories into speech, Coqui_XTTS version 2 and StyleTTS were evaluated using a subjective mean opinion score for naturalness and understandability. Coqui_XTTS outperformed its counterpart, with the language model scoring 4.44 out of 5, whereas StyleTTS scored 1.7 out of 5. This demonstrates the ability of Coqui_XTTS to generate high-quality natural speech, add an immersive auditory element to the story, and enhance the user experience.},

  abstract={In current days, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved in requisites of computerized methodologies, hardware implementations, and approaches in numerous areas. This review summarizes the most recent developments in AI, and the practical approaches of AI in biomedicine such as, disease diagnosis, life support, biomedical information processing, and biomedical research. Once an algorithm learns how to use information, it can perform automatically which is the key advantage of machine learning. Cardiac diseases, neural disorders and cancer are the major illness areas that exploit AI technology. The goal of this study is to keep track of new research findings, explore technological availability, appraise the enormous potential of AI in biomedicine, and motivate biomedical investigators. Like the AI itself, it can be argued that its application to biomedicine is still in its infancy. Further progress and discoveries push the boundaries and in the foreseeable future, the scope of AI is persisted to increase.},

  number={4},
  pages={885-895},
  abstract={The heightened emphasis on the regulation of deep generative models, propelled by escalating concerns pertaining to privacy and compliance with regulatory frameworks, underscores the imperative need for precise control mechanisms over these models. This urgency is particularly underscored by instances in which generative models generate outputs that encompass objectionable, offensive, or potentially injurious content. In response, machine unlearning has emerged to selectively forget specific knowledge or remove the influence of undesirable data subsets from pretrained models. However, modern machine unlearning approaches typically assume access to model parameters and architectural details during unlearning, which is not always feasible. In multitude of downstream tasks, these models function as black-box systems, with inaccessible pretrained parameters, architectures, and training data. In such scenarios, the possibility of filtering undesired outputs becomes a practical alternative. Our proposed method feature aware similarity thresholding (FAST) effectively suppresses undesired outputs by systematically encoding the representation of unwanted features in the latent space. We employ user-marked positive and negative samples to guide this process, leveraging the latent space's inherent capacity to capture these undesired representations. During inference, we use this identified representation in the latent space to compute projection similarity metrics with newly sampled latent vectors. Subsequently, we meticulously apply a threshold to exclude undesirable samples from the output.},

  abstract={GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) are a type of deep learning generative model that has lately gained popularity in recent years. GANs can learn patterns from high-dimensional complex data, making them useful for image, audio and video processing. Nonetheless, there are several significant obstacles in the training of GANs, such as instability, mode collapse and non-convergence. To address these issues, researchers have developed a variety of GAN variations by rethinking network topology, modifying the form of goal functions, and changing optimization to precise methods in recent years. This paper describes a thorough analysis of the progress of GAN architecture and optimization solutions to improve its efficiency in various computer vision applications and challenges that are to be faced while implementing the model towards CV (computer vision) is described. It is believed that GAN is strong model and further researches are needed to work in this area to solve a variety of computer vision real time applications.},

  abstract={The automation of railway operations is an activity in constant growth. Different railway stakeholders are already developing their research activities for the future driverless autonomous driving based on computer vision (CV) and artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced perception technologies (e.g., obstacle detection). Unfortunately, the AI models are opaque in nature, and there are no certification accepted rules for CV&AI-enhanced functionality certification. Capturing and labeling camera image in real environment is expensive in terms of time and resources and it does not guarantee enough variation in edge visibility conditions, which makes the resulting database less valuable for the validation and verification (V&V) processes. To meet the increasing needs of trusted CV&AI-based solutions, numerous V&V approaches have been proposed in other sectors such as automotive, most of them based on virtual simulators. Unfortunately, there is currently no virtual perception simulator for railway scenario. This work aims to create a semi-automatic system based on virtual scenarios measuring the CV&AI-enhanced system performance facing different visibility conditions. It will be based on the global accuracy metrics and detected potential safety and operation rules’ violations. This work also demonstrates the quantitative and qualitative improvements while reducing current V&V cost.},

  abstract={Accurate prediction of crash frequency is important in highway safety research. One obstacle for developing crash frequency models is the lack of real crash data. One way to address this obstacle is to generate realistic artificial data (RAD) that mimics the known causal relationships between contributing factors and crashes. There is no existing research demonstrating use of RAD in predicting crashes. This study first generates a RAD dataset using a transformer-based tabular generative adversarial network (TTGAN) and then uses it to predict crash frequency. Five traditional machine learning models and one deep learning model were tested. Results showed that the deep learning model, TabNet, outperformed the traditional machine learning models. The model performance was also tested using observed (real) crash data. The performance ranking of the six models on real data and RAD was the same, thus demonstrating that synthetic data can be used to test promising machine learning models.},

  year={2022},
  volume={60},
  number={},
  pages={1-14},
  abstract={In recent years, hyperspectral image classification (HIC) algorithm based on deep learning has been widely studied, and has achieved much better results than traditional algorithms. HIC using small samples has gradually become a research hotspot, and the generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become a brilliant application in this field. However, the HIC results based on GAN methods are poor and volatile, since a single loss function cannot accurately measure the distance between the generated samples and the real samples in different hyperspectral images. To resolve this problem, we propose a novel immune evolutionary generative adversarial network (HIEGAN) via leveraging the evolutionary strategy and immune strategy. Specifically, we enhance the performance of the generator in two ways: 1) HIEGAN uses multiple loss functions for calculation and backpropagation, so as to endow the generator with different parameter values and select the best one as the evolution result each time to enter the next iteration and 2) in the training process, we preserve the optimal generator as memory cells to avoid the performance degradation of the generator. Through these changes, HIEGAN overcame the defects of GAN, improved the stability of GAN, and finally improved classification efficiency. At the same time, in order to alleviate the overfitting problem of depth network under small samples, we change convolution and deconvolution into ghost module to reduce the network parameters. Experiments on three classical datasets validate that HIEGAN has encouraging performance in HIC under small samples.},

  volume={44},

  pages={9629-9640},
  abstract={We propose a unified game-theoretical framework to perform classification and conditional image generation given limited supervision. It is formulated as a three-player minimax game consisting of a generator, a classifier and a discriminator, and therefore is referred to as Triple Generative Adversarial Network (Triple-GAN). The generator and the classifier characterize the conditional distributions between images and labels to perform conditional generation and classification, respectively. The discriminator solely focuses on identifying fake image-label pairs. Theoretically, the three-player formulation guarantees consistency. Namely, under a nonparametric assumption, the unique equilibrium of the game is that the distributions characterized by the generator and the classifier converge to the data distribution. As a byproduct of the three-player formulation, Triple-GAN is flexible to incorporate different semi-supervised classifiers and GAN architectures. We evaluate Triple-GAN in two challenging settings, namely, semi-supervised learning and the extremely low data regime. In both settings, Triple-GAN can achieve excellent classification results and generate meaningful samples in a specific class simultaneously. In particular, using a commonly adopted 13-layer CNN classifier, Triple-GAN outperforms extensive semi-supervised learning methods substantially on several benchmarks no matter data augmentation is applied or not.},

  abstract={Various biometric technologies are applied to secure authentication, and use Internet of things and smart devices; among them, speech recognition is used as an interface for artificial intelligence (AI) devices as it can conveniently operate and control AI devices through interactive commands. Voice interface, developed with AI technology, is an innovative method to actively control devices. However, the system's vulnerabilities are exploited by malicious attempts on the system, such as dolphin and adversarial attacks on speech recognition devices, and frequent unintended errors occur, such as malfunctioning in response to unauthorized voice signals. In this study, we attempt to effectively find vulnerabilities in these AI speech recognition devices using fuzzing techniques that are generally used to find vulnerabilities in software. In addition, for effective testing, an optimization method for voice fuzzing is proposed to reduce testing time from test coverage perspective. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimization scheme can improve the testing time by approximately 29% by adopting a two-stage fuzzing method.},

  abstract={Since years, the interior space planning stage typically involves a labor intensive, iterative process that required manually balancing multiple factors, including meeting specific design and aesthetic goals by incorporating professional input, and optimizing design performance for efficiency and user experience. Traditional approaches for interior space layout optimization had face several challenges which include noise in labels, doesn't captured complex relationships. Therefore, this research proposes Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)-GraphSAGE for interior space layout optimization. Initially, the data is taken from Regional Planning and Land Use Analysis Network (RPLAN) dataset. Then, data is preprocessed by using Soft label encoder which effectively captured uncertainty in labels. The preprocessed data is used for room graph generation by using Wasserstein GAN which effectively, generated more realistic room layouts by capturing complex relationships between objects. After that, layout generation is done by using GraphSAGE for capturing complex relationships between objects by enabling contextual layout generation. Finally, design and quality evaluation is done by using space syntax analysis which effectively, analyzed spatial relationships by revealing hidden patterns. The proposed Wasserstein GAN- GraphSAGE established better results, IOU of 0.19, precision 0.48, recall 0.50 when compared with existing Bicycle GAN.},

  abstract={The increasing use of social platforms has led to the rampant spread of disinformation in a number of domains and hampered the credibility of these sources. Disinformation is a type of information disorder wherein fake information is generated with the intent to harm. Machine learning and deep learning can be used to detect such auto-generated information. The conventional method includes gathering vast volumes of text data in terms of both true and fake news stories, headlines, or any other sources and then labeling the data. This leaves us with the issues of human bias within these existing systems, the quality of the aggregated data from different sources and their accurate labeling. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a textual deep fake detection and generation framework based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The methods are demonstrated on three separate domains namely, political data, sports-related data, and medical data pertaining to COVID 19. Cosine similarity-based evaluation metric is employed for analyzing the classification accuracy of the discriminator and the performance of the Generator in generating near-true fake articles which are very similar in the style and context to the real datasets. The contribution of this work is threefold; firstly, we have demonstrated the generator network which generates the synthetic textual deep-fakes which are extremely similar to the actual instances of disinformation. Secondly, the development of a discriminator network that detects the system-generated data with the real data and lastly, the composite GAN model which can be used in various applications such as automated labeling and annotation is shown. Additionally, this approach can help in generating balanced datasets required for machine learning tasks and alleviate the problem of bias in AI systems, especially for disinformation detection tasks where the disinformation class instances are typically lesser as compared to the true information instances.},

In a world where human error is majorly becoming the sole reason for mistakes, as small as a missed medication to huge ones like Chernobyl, it is becoming increasingly important to automate as many actions as possible. Creating automated organizations is only but a first step towards the goal. We decided to make an art organization which sells art to make money. The standard way of doing that would be to create a web platform like Amazon (controlled by humans) that sells art and let human artists upload their artwork. But in the interest of keeping this as automated as possible; we have decided to make a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which generates art. Our organization will sell this art created by the GAN and use the revenues to pay for its resources. An AI will be heading it.

  abstract={This study assesses an innovative AI literacy intervention program for teachers that incorporates social-emotional learning (SEL) into its teaching approach. Executed through three distinct strands—ABOUT, WITH, and FOR—the program aims to enhance foundational knowledge of AI, practical applications in the classroom, and ethical considerations in education. Longitudinal data collected from 54 Slovenian future K-12 teachers indicate marked improvements in both AI and SEL competencies. A hierarchical cluster analysis revealed distinct teacher profiles, illustrating a notable shift from skepticism to advocacy in the application of AI and SEL throughout the duration of the program. Notably, findings demonstrate that the program’s impact doubles the effect size benchmark established by Hattie’s hinge point, underscoring the significant and transformative influence of the program. Further research is needed to assess the long-term impact of such programs aiming at genAI in broader educational contexts.},

  abstract={Acquiring high-quality medical images such as MRI scans is essential for diagnostics and treatment planning but remains challenging due to high costs, health risks, and data scarcity. To address this, we propose the use of Generative Ad-versarial Networks (GANs) to synthesize MRI images, alleviating the limitations of medical data availability. This paper presents a fine-tuned BigGAN model, optimized to generate MRI scans representing different stages of Alzheimer's disease. We explore the impact of various loss functions, including Adversarial, Hinge, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss, on model performance. While the outputs showcase the potential of GAN s to generate high-quality medical images, challenges such as mode collapse and overfitting remain. The synthesized images offer significant promise for enhancing AI model training and medical research, particularly in scenarios where acquiring real medical images is difficult.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence has recently emerged as a transformative technology which is able to analyze vast datasets and generate valuable insights, particularly in supply chain management. Simultaneously, the proliferation of Internet of Behaviors which collects and analyzes data on human behaviors enables businesses to gain a deeper understanding of user preferences and habits. Despite the growing adoption of generative artificial intelligence and Internet of Behaviors, their interaction and combined impacts on supply chain management remain underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by examining how generative artificial intelligence and Internet of Behaviors can be leveraged to enhance business operations. To be specific, we first review the relevant literature to identify the key issues and challenges associated with generative artificial intelligence and Internet of Behaviors. We then discuss real-world applications to illustrate the practical value these technologies bring to businesses. Based on the collected literature and industry practices, we propose a framework for businesses to integrate generative artificial intelligence and Internet of Behaviors into their supply chain management. This framework highlights the significant opportunities for businesses to enhance their supply chain performance by adopting these advanced technologies. Finally, we build a future research agenda and draw our conclusion.},

This work presents the use of AI to connect different sets of users and help them solve their life problems. Currently, sharing the wisdom of the old generation is happening within the close family or the student circle alone. To receive knowledge from a wider community at their fingertips, we designed a chatbot called wisdomBOT which can connect the younger generation users with the older generation users to receive their wisdom through the sharing of life experiences and stories and to learn from them. It also helps to address the loneliness of the older generation and connect them through a new way to make younger friends.},

This study presents a comprehensive framework for integrating generative AI into intent-based industrial automation, which aims to align high-level business goals with precise operational tasks on the factory floor. The proposed architecture synergistically combines three main components: Business Intents, the Intent Layer, and the Factory Floor Shop. This framework leverages foundation models such as the most prominent large language models (LLMs) and advanced communication technologies to translate strategic business intents—such as cost optimization, order management, and market adaptation into actionable tasks to improve operational efficiency, responsiveness, and strategic alignment. We also propose a process of fine-tuning LLMs to optimize their interaction flow within the intent-based system, highlighting the augmentation techniques employed to adapt LLMs for industrial contexts. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show percentage improvements compared to pretrained LLM models.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={487-492},
  abstract={Due to the huge differences in scene complexity and object scale of different images, local image redrawing is a very challenging task. Existing work generally focuses on the completeness and uniformity of objects before and after local redrawing, however, it neglects the reasonableness of the object scale and the naturalness of the object scene articulation. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel framework for image local redrawing, called Adaptive Fusion Local Redrawing Model (AFLRM), which is capable of adaptively generating accurate masks and optimizing mask edge processing. Specifically, we implement an adaptive mask generation technique that can dynamically adjust the mask size according to the complex scale relationships between scenes and objects adaptively. At the same time, the fusion prompt guides the dynamic adjustment of mask edge blurring and the number of reserved pixels, which effectively reduces the transition traces between the generated content and the original image, and realizes a more natural fusion redrawing effect. And based on this, a consistent framework for automatically expanding image data is designed, which can effectively solve the problem of insufficient experimental data in some fields through the automatic redrawing of data. Extensive experiments on the public datasets COCO and EditBench show that our AFLRM achieves high-quality local redrawing, is general and robust, and provides a good balance between uniformity before and after object redrawing as well as object scale articulation rationality.},

  title={Comparing Generative AI Literature Reviews Versus Human-Led Systematic Literature Reviews: A Case Study on Big Data Research}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={13},
  number={},
  pages={56210-56219},
  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming research methodologies, including Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs). While traditional, human-led SLRs are labor-intensive, AI-driven approaches promise efficiency and scalability. However, the reliability and accuracy of AI-generated literature reviews remain uncertain. This study investigates the performance of GPT-4-powered Consensus in conducting an SLR on Big Data research, comparing its results with a manually conducted SLR. To evaluate Consensus, we analyzed its ability to detect relevant studies, extract key insights, and synthesize findings. Our human-led SLR identified 32 primary studies (PSs) and 207 related works, whereas Consensus detected 22 PSs, with 16 overlapping with the manual selection and 5 false positives. The AI-selected studies had an average citation count of 202 per study, significantly higher than the 64.4 citations per study in the manual SLR, indicating a possible bias toward highly cited papers. However, none of the 32 PSs selected manually were included in the AI-generated results, highlighting recall and selection accuracy limitations. Key findings reveal that Consensus accelerates literature retrieval but suffers from hallucinations, reference inaccuracies, and limited critical analysis. Specifically, it failed to capture nuanced research challenges and missed important application domains. Precision, recall, and F1 scores of the AI-selected studies were 76.2%, 38.1%, and 50.6%, respectively, demonstrating that while AI retrieves relevant papers with high precision, it lacks comprehensiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a hybrid AI-human SLR framework, where AI enhances search efficiency while human reviewers ensure rigor and validity. While AI can support literature reviews, human oversight remains essential for ensuring accuracy and depth. Future research should assess AI-assisted SLRs across multiple disciplines to validate generalizability and explore domain-specific LLMs for improved performance.},

As a result, there are numerous approaches to assess the effectiveness of an AI model. In order to evaluate a model’s performance, both its accuracy and how quickly it processes fresh data are measured. Examining the model’s robustness to data that is not in the training set and its capacity for sophisticated problem solving are also included in the evaluation process. Because it identifies opportunities for improvement and facilitates better decision-making, interpretability is a crucial component of evaluating an AI model’s performance. Finally, a range of measures and methods are used in performance evaluation of AI models to assess their efficacy.},

  abstract={The design of complex cyber-physical systems involves balancing multiple, often conflicting performance objectives. In practice, some design requirements remain implicit, embedded in the intuition and expertise of seasoned designers who have worked on similar systems for years. These designers rely on their experience to explore a limited set of promising design candidates, evaluating or simulating them with detailed but computationally slow scientific models. The typical goal is to produce a diverse array of high-performing configurations that offer flexibility in trade-offs and avoid premature commitment to a specific design. In this invited talk, we describe an AI assistant that leverages neuro-symbolic machine learning to automate parts of the system design process. Our approach extends oracle-guided inductive synthesis by integrating a hierarchy of oracles, ranging from slow, detailed scientific models to faster but lower-fidelity deep neural network surrogates and symbolic rules. This approach accelerates design iterations, especially during early design phases. We employ deep generative models in the form of fine-tuned large language models to learn the valid design space, followed by joint exploration and optimization across this learned manifold. This allows the generation of a diverse set of optimal designs based on specified performance objectives.},

This paper explores an intent-based management framework designed to simplify this procedure. By receiving high-level network requirements through descriptive text and supplementary images representing the desired outcome, the framework ingests and translates them into network configuration files. These files facilitate the seamless deployment of a open-source 5G Core, without any human intervention, tailored to the stakeholders’ needs.

The final color cartoon image from the grayscale image is generated with Encoder-Decoder UNet, and in this phase, both the prior global and local user hints information will be introduced to control the final color scheme. The benefit of this two phases approach is to generate the high-quality color cartoon image while allowing users to control final effect with more user guide involved. The two phases colorization could be done in almost real-time and user could take tuning for the generated color cartoon image interactively.},

How-ever, radio frequency interference (RFI) detection, mitigation, and avoidance are some of the main challenges in astronomical radio data. Additionally, they are essential steps for selecting the best site to initiate the radio telescope. RFI mitigation is arduous because interference can take a wide range of forms and affects different scientific goals. The substantial challenges of handling large radio data volumes make it a good application of deep learning (DL). The research aims to mitigate the interference using a DL-based approach, specifically, conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), because of its powerful ability to differentiate the interference and the clean data.},

In this paper, strategies for students, programmers and enthusiasts to understand the prompting methods to generate codes in multiple languages by translating source code written in one language to another target language using generative AI is explored. The prompts are created to test the ability of generative AI to create codes in C, Java, C++, and Python. Some of the methods of generating the complete program using limited original source code statements is presented. In summary, while generating source code in a target language, generative AI tools downplay the significance of accuracy of statements written in original language, syntax, semantics, as well as missing statements in a program. Irrespective of these, generative AI tools are still able to generate complete code in a target language by correcting errors.},

Introducing a new formative technology, generative AI, to cloud security has far-reaching benefits for automating threat detection, real-time incident addressing, and vulnerability management. This paper focuses on extending generative AI with cloud security tools like AWS GuardDuty and Google Cloud Security Command Center; the contemplation of accuracy enhancement and response efficiency highlights its aim. Concerning actual applications such as SOAR systems, the study demonstrates how media industry giants, such as Netflix and JPMorgan Chase, have used AI to minimize risk factors while increasing operational efficiency. The paper also discusses the significant increase in response time, enhanced detection accuracy, and the shift to proactive security strategies brought by generative AI. Drawing attention to AI systems’ opportunities, the study examines the subsequent issues connected with AI applications, including over-dependence on AI tools, adversarial risk to models, and the complex nature of decisionmaking in the context of AI systems.

  abstract={Training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) requires large amounts of data, and creating sufficiently large datasets to generate images of faces with attributes of a specific group is difficult. In this study, we propose a few-shot method to rapidly generate high-quality images of faces with features associated with a specific group. Our proposed approach comprises two techniques, Pivotal Tuning Inversion (PTI) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PTI consists of two processes: Inversion and Pivotal Tuning. The images of the dataset are projected into the latent space as latent vectors by Inversion, and the pretrained weights of the generator are tuned to adapt to the dataset by Pivotal Tuning. The distribution with the features of the group is obtained from the latent vectors using PCA. Since training on the dataset requires only a short computational time by using these techniques, our method is faster than the previous few-shot methods in the image generation process. With three datasets each containing approximately 100 face images of members of specific groups, the experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved the generation of higher-quality images with the features of the group in a shorter computational time than all previous few-shot methods.},

  abstract={With the increasing usage of direct-to-consumer healthcare devices, it is paramount for physicians to identify the potential usage for patient management. The complexity of sensor signal patterns in healthcare, in addition to the variability of physiological data, presents essential challenges in developing specific diagnostic and monitoring tools. The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) role in improving the interpretability of machine learning (ML) methods for sensor signal analysis, mainly in applications like electrocardiography (ECG), wearable health tracking, pressure sensors, and wearable inertial sensors. An integration of cloud-based DL methods with wearable devices is advanced as a smart healthcare system to help automate cardiac classification using consumer electronics. This paper proposes an Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Customer Healthcare Electronics Using Feature Selection and Attention Mechanism (XAICHE-FSAM) model. The aim is to develop novel XAI techniques tailored for enhancing transparency, reliability, and decision-making in customer electronics used in healthcare applications. Initially, the data pre-processing stage applies dual levels, such as denoising-based adaptive wavelet thresholding (AWT) and robust scaling-based Z-score normalization method to normalize the input data. Furthermore, various filter techniques like Chi-square, Fisher’s Score, Correlation Coefficient, and Information Gain (IG) are employed for the feature selection (FS) process. For the classification process, the attention-based long short-term memory technique is utilized. Finally, the XAI method Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) is used to interpret and explain the AI decisions of the model. The performance validation of the XAICHE-FSAM methodology is examined under the ECG Arrhythmia Classification dataset. The comparison study of the XAICHE-FSAM methodology portrayed a superior accuracy value of 99.06% over existing methods.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an emerging technology in Artificial Intelligence (AI). They are an unsupervised learning framework that involves automatically learning patterns from input data to generate synthetic output that closely resembles the original input. GANs enable the creation of datasets by replicating copies of fake outputs based on given inputs. Using GANs, machines can generate unique content that is distinct from human-created data. GANs are widely used in various image-related areas, such as image-text conversion, photo-to-emoji conversion, face aging, new human face generation, super-resolution image conversion, and more. This paper focuses on enhancing the resolution of magnetic resonance images (MRI), which is a common method used in medical imaging. However, obtaining high-quality MRI scans often requires long waiting times and the use of lab equipment with restrictions. Additionally, there are health hazards associated with MRI radiation, resulting in lower-quality images. Super-resolution GANs (SRGANs) can potentially address this issue. Super-resolution is a method that can generate high-resolution images from lower-resolution ones. Previously, technologies such as bi-cubic interpolation, linear interpolation, and nearest neighbor interpolation were used to achieve higher resolution. However, the results obtained using the proposed SRGAN model outperform these conventional methods in terms of performance},

  abstract={For GAN-based Person Re-identification (Re-ID), the key is to generate pedestrian images with higher identity consistency and meanwhile larger intra-class diversity. Generally, the main discriminative parts focus on some local regions from the foreground of each pedestrian image for Re-ID, and they should be irrelevant to the background. Whereas, most existing methods generate pedestrian images only based on global features, which difficultly achieves emphasizing crucial local regions and weakening the background. Based on this, we propose a CAM-enhancing generative Re-ID method in which the global and local features are jointly used. In the proposed method, an adaptive CAM-enhancing local encoder is designed to explore the significance of local appearances and enhance the effect of crucial local features in generations, where the foreground is divided into multiple local parts and separated from the background by pedestrian segmentation. Moreover, a new generation loss is proposed to supervise the identity consistency by reducing the inconsistency of crucial regions in foregrounds and meanwhile enrich the intra-class diversity by generating variant backgrounds. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method obtains better generation images and Re-ID performance than other methods.},

  abstract={Artificial neural networks aspire to mimic human intelligence by constantly learning from a series of tasks without forgetting past knowledge. The most typical way to achieve this kind of learning is to store previously learned task data and replay previously stored data when training a new task. However, the performance of these methods will be affected with the reduction of memory during training. To solve this problem, a new generative replay algorithm is proposed in this paper —— A generative replay method based on the fusion of random gating and attention mechanism. This method is used to generate visual significance features for the model to remember past sample information. First, we introduce an attention mechanism into the generated model to address the issue of the quality of the generated replay data. This mechanism enhances the data salience of feature information during large-scale model training and allows the generated replay network to produce visual salience features, which essentially mimic the way a human observes. Secondly, because of the overfitting phenomenon in the training process of the model, a random gating mechanism is introduced to improve the generalization of the model and improve the accuracy of the model. Finally, we use the CIFAR100 and Permuted MNIST datasets to validate the efficacy of our method.},

  abstract={Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of vision loss globally, and its early detection contributes to preventing complications. In this context, an architectural framework is proposed for retinal image generation in diabetic retinopathy. The generated images are subjected to a systematic clinical validation process conducted by ophthalmologists to assess their alignment with the clinical manifestations of diabetic retinopathy and enhance their applicability in pathology analysis. The dataset used for training, testing, and validating the generative model must possess an adequate volume and a balanced class distribution. High visual quality and accurate representation of the morphological features specific to each stage of diabetic retinopathy are fundamental elements for achieving the targeted outcomes. The developed architecture enables the synthesis of highly realistic retinal representations, supporting both the training of diagnostic models and the investigation of disease progression through generative artificial intelligence.},
