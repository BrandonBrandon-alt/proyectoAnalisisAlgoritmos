  abstract={Lifelong learning describes an ability that enables humans to continually acquire and learn new information without forgetting. This capability, common to humans and animals, has lately been identified as an essential function for an artificial intelligence system aiming to learn continuously from a stream of data during a certain period of time. However, modern neural networks suffer from degenerated performance when learning multiple domains sequentially and fail to recognize past learned tasks after being retrained. This corresponds to catastrophic forgetting and is ultimately induced by replacing the parameters associated with previously learned tasks with new values. One approach in lifelong learning is the generative replay mechanism (GRM) that trains a powerful generator as the generative replay network, implemented by a variational autoencoder (VAE) or a generative adversarial network (GAN). In this article, we study the forgetting behavior of GRM-based learning systems by developing a new theoretical framework in which the forgetting process is expressed as an increase in the model’s risk during the training. Although many recent attempts have provided high-quality generative replay samples by using GANs, they are limited to mainly downstream tasks due to the lack of inference. Inspired by the theoretical analysis while aiming to address the drawbacks of existing approaches, we propose the lifelong generative adversarial autoencoder (LGAA). LGAA consists of a generative replay network and three inference models, each addressing the inference of a different type of latent variable. The experimental results show that LGAA learns novel visual concepts without forgetting and can be applied to a wide range of downstream tasks.},

  abstract={A microgrid can be formed by the integration of different components such as loads, renewable/conventional units, and energy storage systems in a local area. Microgrids with the advantages of being flexible, environmentally friendly, and self-sufficient can improve the power system performance metrics such as resiliency and reliability. However, the design and implementation of microgrids are always faced with different challenges considering the uncertainties associated with loads and renewable energy resources, sudden load variations, energy management of several energy resources, etc. Therefore, it is required to employ such rapid and accurate methods, as artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, to address these challenges and improve the MG's efficiency, stability, security, and reliability. Utilization of AI helps to develop systems as intelligent as humans to learn, decide, and solve problems. This article presents a review on different applications of AI-based techniques in microgrids such as energy management, load and generation forecasting, protection, power electronics control, and cyber security. Different AI tasks such as regression and classification in microgrids are discussed using methods including machine learning, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, support vector machines, etc. The advantages, limitation, and future trends of AI applications in microgrids are discussed.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks or GANS, are another way of achieving generative modeling using various deep learning methods like convoluted neural networks. They have a wide range of applications like :- image to image translation, improving the resolution of the images, creating multiple images using a single image, checking if the image is real or fake and the list goes on. One of the implementations of GANS, i.e, DCGANS would be discussed in this paper. DCGANS stands for Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, it uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the generator and discriminator, respectively. This DCGANS give prompt result while processing many real time images. In their study Unsupervised representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, Radford et al. proposed it. This algorithm generates fake images after being trained on a dataset of human faces. However to create these fake images, the quality of these images should be compromised and this can also make them easily identifiable as fake image. So, here StyleGANS will be used as another implementation of GANS. StyleGANS is not only used for improving the quality of these images but also it helps us to increase fakeness of the images. This project uses the CelebA dataset from Kaggle to train the models.},

  abstract={This paper discusses securities and cryptocurrency trading using artificial intelligence (AI) in the sense that it focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on selected technical indicators before proceeding to modelling, and then to develop more practical models by introducing new reward loss function that maximizes the returns during training phase. The results of EDA reveal that the complex patterns within the data can be better captured by discriminative classification models and this was endorsed by performing back-testing on two securities using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) as discriminative models against their counterpart Naïve Bayes as a generative model. To enhance the learning process, the new reward loss function is utilized to retrain the ANN with testing on AAPL, IBM, BRENT CRUDE and BTC using auto-trading strategy that serves as the intelligent unit, and the results indicate this loss superiorly outperforms the conventional cross-entropy used in predictive models. The overall results of this work suggest that there should be larger focus on EDA and more practical losses in the research of machine learning modelling for stock market prediction applications.},

  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence into educational tools is transforming learning environments. In computer science, students frequently encounter challenges with complex concepts and practical applications. While LLMs offer valuable support, their responses can sometimes lack precision or rely on outdated information. Addressing these limitations is essential to enhance the effectiveness of AI-based tools in educational support. The main objective of this paper is to propose a tool-based RAG as automated assistant in an OOP Course. The tool was tested using common student queries and its responses were compared with those generated by ChatGPT. Initial observations suggest that RAG consistently generated contextually relevant responses due to its ability to access pertinent information from a structured knowledge base, resulting in more precise and applicable answers for students. The introduction of a RAG-based tool in classrooms has the potential to enhance student learning by providing instant, tailored responses to specific queries.},

  abstract={The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence has presented novel opportunities for innovation and practice in the field of education. This study utilizes a questionnaire survey approach to examine the factors influencing the application of Generative Artificial Intelligence in teachers' educational instruction, grounded in Diffusion of Innovation Theory. The research proposes hypotheses that teachers' adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence in educational instruction is influenced by seven factors: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, visibility, information channels, and teachers' personal innovativeness. Through correlation analysis, it is discovered that these influencing factors are significantly correlated with teachers' adoption and application of Generative Artificial Intelligence in educational instruction. Regression analysis further reveals that compatibility and visibility have significant positive predictive effects on teachers' adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence. Based on the data results, this study proposes corresponding strategies to further enhance the diffusion of Generative Artificial Intelligence, aiming to improve the quality and efficiency of teachers' educational instruction, reduce their workload, and promote educational equity and high-quality balanced development.},

We expect this research will lead to innovative pedagogical approaches to enhance undergraduate computer science and engineering education. In particular, we describe how ChatGPT was used in two computing-based courses: a Junior-level course in database systems and a Senior-level class in mobile application development. We identify four evidence-based learning strategies: well-defined learning goals, authentic learning experiences, structured learning progression, and strategic assessment. We align these strategies with the two aforementioned courses and evaluate the usefulness of ChatGPT specifically in achieving the learning goals.

  abstract={Today’s AI technology has various applications in many fields, thus creating opportunities to improve different aspects of daily life and optimize business operations. However, there are also societal expectations and concerns regarding AI and its future impacts. Investigating such societal opinions and feelings is essential for social acceptance, further development and distribution of such technology, regulation, and adaptation to changes and policies. Despite this situation, such an exploration has not been sufficiently conducted in the existing literature and the most appropriate methods for such an exploration have not been sufficiently investigated. To contribute to addressing this limitation in literature, this study applies topic modeling and sentiment analysis approaches to investigate societal opinions and feelings about the future of AI on social media, which includes conversations from various segments of society. A corpus consisting of 16,611 comments and 998 unique Reddit post titles was analyzed with a customized BERTopic model for topic modeling and a BERT sentiment classification model. This study highlights the significant advantages of using BERTopic and BERT models in analyzing a large sample of social media discussions. The results of this study can help realize the potential of text analytics methods through transformer-based language models to derive empirical findings from large-scale data samples.},

  abstract={Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been effective for learning generative models for real-world data. However, accompanied with the generative tasks becoming more and more challenging, existing GANs (GAN and its variants) tend to suffer from different training problems such as instability and mode collapse. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN framework called evolutionary GANs (E-GANs) for stable GAN training and improved generative performance. Unlike existing GANs, which employ a predefined adversarial objective function alternately training a generator and a discriminator, we evolve a population of generators to play the adversarial game with the discriminator. Different adversarial training objectives are employed as mutation operations and each individual (i.e., generator candidature) are updated based on these mutations. Then, we devise an evaluation mechanism to measure the quality and diversity of generated samples, such that only well-performing generator(s) are preserved and used for further training. In this way, E-GAN overcomes the limitations of an individual adversarial training objective and always preserves the well-performing offspring, contributing to progress in, and the success of GANs. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that E-GAN achieves convincing generative performance and reduces the training problems inherent in existing GANs.},

  abstract={Increasing prevalence and simplicity of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, Steganography is shifting from conventional model building to AI model building. AI enables computers to learn from their mistakes, adapt to emerging inputs, and carry out human-like activities. Traditional Linguistic Steganographic approaches lack automation, analysis of Cover text and hidden text volume and accuracy. A formal methodology is used in only a few Steganographic approaches. In the vast majority of situations, traditional approaches fail to survive third-party vulnerability. This study looks at evaluation of an AI-based statistical language model for text Steganography. Since the advent of Natural Language Processing (NLP) into the research field, linguistic Steganography has superseded other types of Steganography. This paper proposes the positive aspects of NLP-based Markov chain model for an auto-generative cover text. The embedding rate, volume, and other attributes of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Steganographic schemes are contrasted in this article between RNN-Stega and RNN-generated Lyrics, two RNN methods. Here the RNN model follows Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The paper also includes a case study on Artificial Intelligence and Information Security, which discusses history, applications, AI challenges, and how AI can help with security threats and vulnerabilities. The final portion is dedicated to the study’s shortcomings, which may be the subject of future research.},

Key concepts from Indian philosophy, including ”buddhi,” ”manas,” ”chit,” and ”ahamkar,” are woven into the framework, enhancing AI’s ability to understand and interact with the world in a more human-like way. The core of the framework consists of ”Buddhi” and ”Manas.” Buddhi, a discriminative AI component, adeptly navigates sensory data, making decisions aligned with human discernment. Complementing it, ”Manas” is a generative core, capable of crafting narratives and generating creative solutions. This synergy creates an iterative loop that encapsulates human thought, enabling machines to think, visualize, and even dream. In addition to advancing AI and ML research, we conducted an experiment using a modified News Aggregator dataset from the UCI repository. The experiment focused on word prediction, and our model, infused with Indian philosophy, outperformed RNN and LSTM models over 30 epochs. This framework has the potential to revolutionize AI and create more human-like machines, ushering in a new era of AI and robotics.},

  abstract={The design and optimization of high-power nonlinear power amplifiers often requires copious time-consuming measurements. To maximize performance, multiple constraints must be satisfied simultaneously in a complex, high-dimensional search space, resulting in a complex and slow design process. This work validates multidimensional load-pull extrapolation using generative adversarial network image completion as a method for reducing the number of measurements required to characterize a power amplifier over multiple design parameters simultaneously. Using 16 output power measurements of a transistor with different input powers and load impedances, an extrapolated three-dimensional load-pull dataset of 24,192 points can be obtained. The extrapolated data accurately predicts the optimal reflection coefficient over input power within a vector distance of about 0.1 on the Smith Chart, resulting in an achieved mean output power error of under 0.2 dB. This can speed up the high-power nonlinear power amplifier design process and can hasten real-time reconfiguration over multiple parameters.},

  abstract={The development of the Internet of things (IoT) and other modern technologies brings not only great convenience and intelligence to society but also the severe problem of cyber security. In recent years, a large number of network attacks, especially botnet and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks which are difficult to detect, have seriously affected the normal operation of social work. Solutions and methods based on artificial intelligence techniques are therefore proposed to help detect cyberattacks. In this paper, the application of GAN in the field of network security is discussed. GAN has been one of the most significant deep learning models in recent years. It consists of a generative model and a discriminative model which can be combined to produce a dynamic game system. GAN has been applied in various fields such as image generation, speech processing, data enhancement, and cyberattack detection. This paper demonstrates the basic working principle and infrastructure of GAN, and also focuses on how the GAN model assists with cyber intrusion detection.},

  abstract={Medical reconstruction of images is essential for deep learning model training, improving diagnosis efficiency, and augmenting small datasets for a range medical purpose. In this work, we investigate the synthesis of realistic and superior chest X-ray pictures using Deep Convolutional neural networks Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). A vital diagnosing technique for breathing problems disorders is chest X-ray imaging, and the development and assessment of AI-based medical devices can benefit from a greater amount of numerous, artificially produced information. We offer a novel method that creates synthetic chest Xray pictures that closely replicate real radiography data by utilizing DCGAN, a generative model architecture. Our solution is based on a two-step process: a discriminator network and a generator. The discriminator discerns among real and fake pictures, while a generator trains to produce accurate images of the chest. Through an intensive training regimen, these two networks continuously enhance the standard of the pictures they produce. We ran comprehensive tests on a variety of chest X-ray image datasets to confirm the efficacy of our methodology. Our DCGAN model produced artificial pictures that bore striking visual similarities to actual X-ray images of the chest, including radiographic noise, disease patterns, and anatomical features. In order to statistically evaluate the diversity and realism of the created photos, we also used a variety of assessment measures, which we used to show that our model created extremely convincing synthetic data. The synthesised chest X-ray pictures might be useful assets for expanding on small datasets, which will help build strong and precise deep-learning algorithms for the detection and classifications of pulmonary diseases. These pictures may also be utilized to improve computer-aided diagnosis system training and validation, which will help medical personnel make better judgements and provide better treatment for patients.},

  abstract={The process of De Novo drug design involves the integration of artificial intelligence with computational intelligence techniques. The proposed system aims to provide precision therapeutics through the development of targeted chemical libraries designed for individual patient’s needs. They also highlight the potential impact of precision medicine. The traditional approach involves trial and error methods in the combination of various chemicals for desired drug discovery that leads to the waste of time and energy. These challenges are overcome through the aid of artificial intelligence techniques. The interaction of molecules, physiochemical properties, and biological interaction of potential drugs are obtained through the aid of optimization algorithms. With the integration of computational intelligence, the design structure becomes more adaptable. This helps in the formation of chemically diverse compound libraries. The important aspect of the proposed system involves the ability of advanced precision therapeutics. The clinical information is necessary for the identification of molecular targets achieved through the aid of optimization algorithms. These obtained targets are necessary for the development of new drugs with high affinity and specificity. This helps in minimizing the off-target effects which improves the therapeutic efficacy. The novel molecular structure is generated using the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The compound properties are optimized using reinforcement and an iterative learning process. The simpler structure of drug-like molecules is obtained through an evolutionary algorithm. Thus the proposed system provides rapid exploration of chemical space that leads to the formation of chemical compounds with personalized pharmacological profiles.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={96-99},
  abstract={Chronic disease management requires continuous care to prevent exacerbations, yet providing 24/7 accessible medical advice is a significant challenge for care providers. The current model of periodic patient visits with standard dialogue responses fails to adequately address the individualized needs of patients and caregivers. This lack of personalized guidance undermines treatment adherence and satisfaction. To bridge this gap, we developed a novel approach leveraging generative AI (GAI) to optimize patient-manager interactions. Focusing on prevalent chronic conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and dementia, we created intelligent dialogue agents that deliver tailored, actionable nursing recommendations aligning with each case's unique circumstances. The developed methodology began by curating a corpus of 30 frequently asked questions on home care, emotional support, and social factors from online patient data across the three diseases. We employed prompt engineering to precisely define the virtual roles of nurses and physicians while implementing a “Rephrase and Respond” (RAR) protocol to enhance query comprehension and generate reliable solutions. The RAR approach solves problems by question restating, followed by contextualized recommendations from the language model. Clinical expert feedback iteratively refined the system's outputs. The evaluation result showed an average gain of 10% in response and an increase of 5% in readability after optimization. The optimized RAR method of large language models effectively improved the quality of nursing advice for chronic disease, aligned with patients' emotional and social needs. The RAR method in medical advisory areas, including chronic disease management and rehabilitation care, enhances the quality and practicality of nursing advice in these domains.},

  abstract={This paper explores and evaluates the use of OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o as a feedback tool for engineering drawings. The AI feedback tool was trained on a synthetic dataset specifically created for the task, which included a comprehensive checklist derived from the Australian Standard for Technical Drawings (AS 1100) and a variety of engineering drawing examples. The evaluation involved repeated testing of three distinct case studies, each representing different levels of drawing accuracy. The findings reveal both strengths and weaknesses in the AI feedback tool’s performance, providing valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of AI in providing feedback on engineering drawings in the education context. The research also highlights the need for further training to improve accuracy in certain areas and the potential bias in the evaluation process. A key observation from this study is that while Open AI’s ChatGPT-4o model can generate feedback, it may not truly ‘understand’ the engineering drawings in the same way a human would. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts to leverage AI in education, particularly in the context of engineering drawing feedback, and underscores the importance of human oversight and intervention in the application of AI technology.},

  abstract={Increasing the performance of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) requires experimentation in choosing the suitable training hyper-parameters of learning rate and batch size. There is no consensus on learning rates or batch sizes in GANs, which makes it a "trial-and-error" process to get acceptable output. Researchers have differing views regarding the effect of batch sizes on run time. This paper investigates the impact of these training parameters of GANs with respect to actual elapsed training time. In our initial experiments, we study the effects of batch sizes, learning rates, loss function, and optimization algorithm on training using the MNIST dataset over 30,000 epochs. The simplicity of the MNIST dataset allows for a starting point in initial studies to understand if the parameter changes have any significant impact on the training times. The goal is to analyze and understand the results of varying loss functions, batch sizes, optimizer algorithms, and learning rates on GANs and address the key issue of batch size and learning rate selection.},

  abstract={In this innovative practice Work-In-Progress paper, Generative AI tools were used in a supplemental assignment in a Lean Concepts class. Students were directed to create a summary of a specific topic covered only partially in the regular class material. Students assigned to the same topic then formed four- or five-student groups and reflected on the effectiveness of the AI tools. The accuracy, consistency and usefulness of the AI-created material was considered. Students also reflected on their own learning from the exercise and their possible future use of AI tools. The results, from 78 students, showed that seven different generative AI tools, with a wide range of prompts, gave similar answers. The answers were judged to be useful and accurate; only two instances of the AI being widely off-topic were seen. The answers were rather vague and general; even when prompted for different topics, the AI results had much text in common. All student groups agreed that human interpretation would be needed before the AI-generated material could be used either for presentation or work. They felt the exercise would make it more likely that they will use generative AI tools in the future. The exercise demonstrates both the usefulness and limitations of AI tools for supplemental learning in technical classes. The exercise was easy to run and could be replicated in any introductory or survey class.},

Specifically, it highlights the issues with the emerging digitalized design methods based on Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI), such as non-standard and unstructured input expressions, high inconsistency in output results, and low repeatability. By utilizing the Knowledge Graph (KG) to achieve accurate semantic representation and orderly contextual association, as well as structured and standardized expression, this study explores and establishes a KG-genAI-based paradigm for the digital and intelligent design of exhibition spaces (KG-genAI-PDIDES). This paradigm drives Midjourney and Stable through unstructured natural language prompting methods for the digital design of UAV exhibition spaces. Comparative analysis of the results demonstrates that the proposed KG-genAI-PDIDES significantly enhances the standardization of input expression and consistency of output results, offering a new design paradigm for the digitization of exhibition spaces.},

  abstract={In the concept of data hiding, image is often used as a cover to hide sensitive data inside it. This approach is considered a good addition in securing information to cryptography which only hides the information and not the presence of the message itself. The combination of Deep Learning with Steganography and Cryptography is rarely done. By utilizing Deep Neural Networks to encrypt and hide the messages, it will be increasingly difficult to decrypt and track.In this study, we developed an encryption mechanism to not only conceal messages, but transforming them into images. The image containing the hidden messages can later be decrypted and converted back into the original message. We use Generative Adversarial Network to develop the encryption and decryption models. Text data is converted into a word vector using word2vec model which then used as input for the encryption model to produce the word images. We use the MNIST dataset to train models which are able to produce images that encrypt 1000 word variations. Based on our experiments, we were able to produce robust encrypted images with 98% accuracy of reversible words. We also show that our model is resistant to various minor image attacks such as scaling, noise addition, and image rotation.},

  abstract={How Artificial Intelligence (AI) supports the performance of traditional firms remains uneven, despite firms having similar access to AI. Using a sample of global publicly quoted companies, we confirm early studies that heterogeneity in firms' ability to scale AI is related to the early orchestration of four AI-specific assets/resources (data, technology infrastructure, AI/data talent, and organisational design). Expanding on early academic work, we uncover four distinct resource-based segments, one of which operates with the full bundle of AI resources and which we call “AI Leaders”. This segment is comprised of the so- called “AI scalers”, i.e. firms for which more than 30% of their costs and revenues are already influenced by AI technologies, as they are able to capitalise on the stock of AI resources invested a few years earlier. We conclude that AI technologies are promising, but the translation of AI investments into significant macroeconomic effects will take time, given that only a small fringe of companies are AI leaders so far and that AI scaling depends on a compounding stock effect. We offer a check list to turbocharge AI scaling based on all the findings in the research.},

  abstract={The swift evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI utilizing deep learning and extensive datasets, has brought substantial benefits across numerous sectors. However, this technological surge simultaneously presents intricate technical hurdles for conventional intellectual property rights protection frameworks. The unprecedented scale, speed, and unique characteristics of AI-generated content significantly strain existing manual and semi-automated IPR management systems. This paper first details the progression and functionalities of pertinent AI technologies. It then examines the pressure these capabilities exert on current IPR frameworks, highlighting technical obstacles related to verifying ownership, detecting infringement at scale, and computationally evaluating originality. We assert that overcoming these obstacles necessitates more than legal adjustments; it demands fundamentally novel engineering approaches applying AI to the IP system. Consequently, this work introduces an AI-powered engineering framework that integrates specific algorithms and applications: Natural Language Processing techniques like semantic embedding models for text analysis and comparison; Computer Vision algorithms such as perceptual hashing and deep feature extraction for image/video analysis; machine learning classifiers for filtering infringement alerts; and blockchain technology for secure timestamping and registration. This framework seeks to deliver scalable, efficient, and resilient tools for IPR registration, authentication, automated infringement surveillance, and support for originality analysis, thereby promoting technological progress while protecting creator entitlements within the dynamic digital ecosystem.},

  abstract={At a time when Artificial Intelligence (AI) urgently needs to transcend traditional research paths, this paper delves into the wisdom of Zhan Guo Ce (Strategies of the Warring States), such as “assessing situations” and “vertical and horizontal alliances.” Employing mathematical models including game theory, optimization algorithms, network science, decision trees, and Bayesian inference, this research uncovers the value of ancient strategies for modern AI. By deconstructing power confrontations through game theory, we reveal strategic equilibrium mechanisms, providing a basis for multi-agent decision-making. Optimization algorithms are utilized to simulate the strategists’ process of weighing pros and cons, aiding AI in resource allocation and path planning. Network science is leveraged to analyze power relationships, optimizing AI network architectures. Decision trees are used to delineate strategists’ decision logic, thereby improving AI decision tree algorithms. Bayesian inference is applied to handle uncertain information, enhancing AI’s environmental adaptability. This study ultimately reveals the mathematical essence of strategic thinking, decision logic, and alliance structures in historical strategies, offering an interdisciplinary perspective for AI algorithm design, decision optimization, and ethical construction, thereby propelling AI towards more intelligent, rational, and reliable development.},

  pages={352-357},
  abstract={The advancements in diffusion model enables the creation of highly detailed images. However, concurrently fusing texts and images poses significant challenges, often struggling with the maintenance of text accuracy across languages, optimal placement, and appropriate typography. To address these challenges, we introduce the Multilingual Accurate Textual Image Customization (MATIC) framework. MATIC employs the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) concept to decompose the textual image generation process into multiple steps, leveraging diverse generative artificial intelligence, including Multimodal Large Language Model (MMLLM) and diffusion model. The framework first generates the desired text and a corresponding prompt for the diffusion model based on user input. The diffusiongenerated image is then examined to remove any undesired text. Meanwhile, the typographic elements are designed to align with the visual content. Finally, the textual image is fused with the aid of a grid coordinate system, evaluated by MMLLM, and further customized by the user through natural language. Experimental results demonstrate that MATIC can produce accurate, high-quality, multilingual textual images that meet user requirements across various domains, including digital marketing, graphic design, and educational content creation.},

This paper examines challenges and limitations linked to students’ reliance on ChatGPT in solving assessments, urging a reconsideration of assessment methodologies. Acknowledging the growing influence of artificial intelligence (AI), the study recommends a reevaluation of these methodologies to enable instructors to design assessments that restrain students from dependence on ChatGPT. It explores constraints in ChatGPT's ability to offer comprehensive and contextually accurate responses, emphasizing the necessity of redesigning assessments to minimize the potential misuse of the model by students. Through an exploration of these limitations, the paper advocates for a nuanced understanding of the dynamic between AI and assessment practices. The findings underscore the significance of adapting assessment methodologies to empower instructors in crafting evaluations that discourage reliance on ChatGPT, providing insights into potential strategies for achieving this objective.},

  number={},
  pages={572-579},
  abstract={This study employs the orders of worth theoretical framework, developed by Boltanski and Thévenot, to analyze how prestigious universities and academic publishers justify and critique the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Through qualitative analysis of AI guidelines from Ivy League universities, top UK universities, and leading publishers, we identify how these organizations mobilize different orders of worth. Civic worth dominates across both sectors, with its emphasis on integrity and accountability. Universities more readily incorporate industrial worth (efficiency) and project/network worth (adaptation) than publishers. Universities establish faculty authorization tests that preserve domestic worth through traditional hierarchies, while creating differentiated legitimacy spaces based on educational context. Publishers construct strict human accountability tests that reject AI as an author and establish compromises that permit limited industrial efficiency for technical functions, simultaneously maintaining rigid boundaries around core scholarly contributions. The tension between industrial efficiency and inspired authenticity creates the central dynamic that institutions must negotiate. Thus, institutional responses to AI are not just technical implementations but social arenas where multiple value systems are negotiated, reinforcing certain conceptions of the common good while marginalizing others.},

Through a survey of 659 students from different engineering majors, a descriptive-quantitative-correlational research design was adopted to analyze the engagement of students from different disciplines with these tools and the relationship between tool usage and learning outcomes. The research findings show that the usage frequencies of both online programming platforms and GAI are “sometimes”, and there are significant differences in usage frequencies among different disciplines. Students majoring in computer and mechanical engineering have relatively high usage frequencies, while those majoring in electronics and civil engineering have lower usage frequencies. Meanwhile, there is a significant positive correlation between the engagement in the use of online programming platforms and GAI. This research provides references for the curriculum design of programming education, helps to optimize the allocation of educational resources, and promotes the innovative development of programming education.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence systems are increasingly used in critical areas like finance, healthcare, and autonomous systems, ensuring their security becomes crucial. Artificial Intelligence models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small changes to input data can cause major errors, as well as steganographic methods that hide harmful information within digital content. Recent techniques, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for steganography and adversarial training for model hardening, have shown promise but face challenges like computational inefficiency, limited generalizability, and susceptibility to evolving threats. The methodology includes five key steps: synthetic data generation, data preprocessing, multi-layered security assessments, dynamic countermeasures, and cross-domain validation. By using adversarial and steganographic data augmentation, the framework strengthens the Artificial Intelligence's ability to handle real-world threats. The approach also integrates advanced feature extraction and classification methods to improve detection accuracy. The model is tested across various domains, demonstrating its ability to secure AI systems against evolving digital threats while maintaining efficiency and adaptability.},

  abstract={The development of large language models (LLM) in generative modeling traces important characteristics through the differed landscapes that are under the effective characteristics through the various emerging technologies. There is a rapid increase in LLM that has attracted numerous researchers, leaders along the public. From a technical perspective, these forms of algorithms always produce content that combines with humanized instructions which aids in creating the instructions and the model structure that completes the assignment patterns. This holds two main processes: the first is where there is an extraction of rules and the generation of the retrieved content. The systems that have been working with rule-based have dominated in generating the model language by facing the issues with system complexity. The models with the computational AI systems have created a greater revolution. It was first developed by creating Gaussian mixture models in the 1950s along with the hidden Markov models. With the use of these models, the sequential data using the speech with the time series approach was developed. This mode of approach develops attraction in the years to come, where the novel methods will be updated regularly, creating life-to-language models.},

  abstract={The quest of imparting intelligence into human creations have led to the inception and progress of Artificial Intelligence (AI). One application of AI is the generation of things like text or images, using a class of neural networks known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Nowadays, AI can generate different sorts of artwork and arts using GANs. However, many traditional art design patterns that are tied historically to a particular segment of the demographics and geographic are left unexplored so far. Henna artwork is one of them. In this regard, this paper aims at the generation of Henna design patterns, which is a widely popular artwork involving of complex creative designs applied mostly on the hands as a type of temporary tattoo in the Indian sub-continent and parts of Asia. The HennaGan introduced in this paper shows that Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCGANs) can be used to generate henna design images with variations effectively. It also creates the base for research into creative Henna art generation using DCGANs and provides insights into how the network parameters can be tuned to obtain a good result.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) harbors the potential to tackle intricate challenges and enhance human capabilities across various domains. Through its significant capabilities, AI plays a crucial role in data analysis, natural language processing (NLP), healthcare, and other decision-based fields. The primary objective of AI in these domains is to render precise decisions promptly. The attainment of higher decisionmaking accuracy and system performance enhancement necessitates the utilization of optimization algorithms to aid in the decision-making process efficiently. Swarm optimization draws inspiration from the collective behavior of animals or insects that cooperate in hunting, thereby facilitating rapid decision-making. This chapter delves into diverse swarm optimization algorithms that support decision-making processes in AI applications and introduces a novel algorithm called African wild dog optimization (AWDO). The proposed AWDO algorithm is an energy-efficient swarm optimization technique that minimizes energy consumption by AI nodes or neurons, resulting in expedited search outcomes. The efficacy of the AWDO algorithm is evaluated against established optimization algorithms like particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization (ACO), artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization algorithm, firefly algorithm, and bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) algorithms in the realm of healthcare diagnosis applications.},

Artificial intelligence has been used in medical diagnostics, detecting financial fraud, managing smart grids, and many other beneficial applications. Large language models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate human language. Tools such as ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Meta's Llama, and xAI's Grok have been widely used in a variety of contexts. However, there are malicious applications of artificial intelligence that are already being used. Artificial intelligence has been used to generate child sexual exploitation material (CSAM). Artificial intelligence being used to facilitate cyber-attacks is a growing concern. Deep fakes have been used to perpetrate elaborate financial frauds. There is also the concern of deep fakes being used to influence elections. Large language models have already been shown to create more believable phishing emails than human threat actors. Perhaps more disturbing, there have been studies showing LLMs providing guidance in planning and execution of a biological attack. AI can be used to identify and exploit vulnerable individuals online, such as for human trafficking, sexual exploitation, or labor exploitation by analyzing social media profiles and patterns of behavior. The current study analyzes the major malicious uses of artificial intelligence, including specific actual cases, and provides an overview of steps to mitigate these uses.},

  abstract={Brain stroke is a complicated disease that is one of the foremost reasons of long-term debility and mortality. Because of breakthroughs in Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) which enable the automated detection and diagnosis of brain stroke as well as intelligently assisting post-brain stroke patients for rehabilitation, is more favorable than a manual diagnosis. Many publications on automated brain stroke detection, diagnosis, and robotic management using DL and AI approaches are now being published. This review provides a study of the detection, diagnosis of brain stroke and robotic management techniques of post-brain stroke rehabilitation from six different perspectives, namely, brain stroke datasets and modalities of brain stroke data collection, pre-processing approaches, DL-based detection and diagnosis of brain stroke, Al-based intelligent post brain stroke rehabilitation assistant, and performance measures. It also examines the conclusions and the consequences of the findings. There are also three ongoing research challenges in the fields of brain stroke detection and diagnosis, as well as post-brain stroke robotic treatment. For this investigation, 130 key papers from the Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science archives were chosen after a comprehensive screening method. This study gives a comprehensive overview of brain stroke detection and post-brain stroke robotic management strategies that may be useful to the scientist’s community working in the field of automatic brain stroke detection and robotic rehabilitation management.},

  abstract={Every aspect of life has been altered for the better by the advancements in computer vision and Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the past decade. As a branch of AI, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have demonstrated impressive achievements across all sectors, particularly the biomedical field, thanks to their capacity to process massive amounts of data. Its potential has been employed in the identification of Brain Tumor (BT) using the medical image for efficient prognosis, with outstanding results. The primary goal of this study is to provide a comprehensive critical examination of previous research on the segmentation and classification of BT from medical images. Researchers that have extensive experience with AI and would like to apply their knowledge to the identification and classification of BT may find this analysis very useful. The literature on the application of AI in the segmentation and categorization of BT is briefly reviewed. This work focused on BT, covering topics such as BT anatomy, freely available data resources, enhancement methods, segmentation, feature extraction, and categorization techniques. From the investigation, it is clear that if there is a large amount of data, the DL model will perform better than the ML model. The data presented in this work will benefit future researchers with a comprehensive evaluation of current publications, as well as the performance of various AI methodologies. We are optimistic that this study will significantly advance BT research.},

  abstract={Emotional Intelligence is the technology where computers are trained to handle, use, understand and manage emotions. Emotional Intelligence (EI) is used in sentimental text generation where sentimental texts like positive, negative and neutral texts are generated. Sentimental text generation is used in many Artificial Intelligence application such as Google Assistant, Siri, Chatbots and so on. Many Deep learning algorithms such as LSTM, Bi-LSTM, RNN and CNN focus on generation of sentimental texts. The research work proposed herein uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for generating texts based on the training dataset. The GAN network has 2 models; generator model which generates the text and discriminator model which evaluates the text and both are trained using Bi-LSTM algorithm. The model is trained using Amazon customer review dataset and the system generates sentimental text such as positive, negative and neutral text for a given product. The existing system uses LSTM algorithm for prediction, but the performance and quality of generated text is low. The proposed system uses the Bi-LSTM algorithm which increases the accuracy of the generated sentimental text. The performance of the framework is evaluated in terms of fluency, sentimental accuracy and context relevance and is compared to the existing system of Automatic Generation of Sentimental Texts using Mixture Adversarial Networks.},

Furthermore, the unstructured data in IoT plays an important role for analyzing the user behaviors, while transmitting and processing these unstructured data consumption of substantial energy. These unstructured data should be mined or restructured. In addition, the increasing number of users in IoT leads to a fast-growing data in IoT, while the Quality of Service (QoS) of IoT should be maintained regardless of the number of IoT users. Therefore, the data transmission and processing in IoT should be performed in a more intelligent manner. All these observations indicate that the integration of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) for IoT is a good propellant to improve the data transmission and processing in IoT, since big data technology (e.g., data integration, data mining, data prediction) could effectively handle various data while AI technology could further facilitate capturing and structuring big data.},

  abstract={The EU Artificial Intelligence Act, implemented in 2024, was the first comprehensive regulation at the European Union level to concern the governance of artificial intelligence. However, despite its progressive approach, the aforementioned Act does not provide adequate protection against risks related to the use of generative AI systems for spreading disinformation, manipulating public opinion, and undermining democratic processes. This article analyzes the key gaps in the regulation, such as the absence of requirements for labeling AI-generated content, the lack of mechanisms for data verification, and insufficient legal accountability for human rights violations resulting from AI use. The author suggests the consideration of these issues in the context of other EU regulations, such as the Digital Services Act, and offers specific recommendations to improve regulation in these areas. The article includes a comparative analysis of different approaches to AI regulation in EU countries, including Spain, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, and Germany, and provides recommendations for enhancing legal mechanisms to effectively counter disinformation and protect human rights.},

  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence technologies in biomedical research has significantly advanced the study of diseases. This contribution presents a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications on applying machine learning, transformers, and generative artificial intelligence in studying five major diseases: cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health disorders, and COVID-19. We analyzed data from the Scopus database from 2012 to 2024 to assess the scientific output, the growth rate of publications in the early years of adoption of the technologies, and the countries pioneering the use of these technologies in diseaseassociated research. In addition, this study quantifies the use of these artificial intelligence techniques in research for different application areas of the biomedical field worldwide, highlighting various adoption patterns and the scientific impact of associated publications. Our results reveal that machine learning is widely used in surgical applications, while transformers have gained prominence in diagnostics, mainly through advanced text processing and image analysis. For its part, generative artificial intelligence is increasingly used in applications to optimize operational processes. This study highlights the transformative impact of emerging artificial intelligence technologies in biomedical research and provides insights into their roles and potential for improving healthcare. Furthermore, we propose a scalable framework for largescale scientific data analysis to guide future research trajectories and explore new applications in the biomedical sector.},

  abstract={In this paper, we explore memory and Schema through the lens of mathematical representation. By defining themes related to cognitive processes, we propose a compression algorithm that measures and retains important information of previous (historic) user-Generative AI interaction. Time and memory are interconnected via a decay mechanism, where context gets more abstract as time passes. At the same time, memories with thematic resemblance can be structured into Schemas using set theory, based on rules influenced by a maturity threshold. This threshold is determined by factors such as criticality, emotional-user interaction, and mass, which is the measure of the summation of related memories. Our approach reconstructs memories into reusable parameters and formulates Schemas, offering a foundation for more personalized and cost-effective human-GAI interactions.},

However, it is challenging for GANs to find a balance for competition between generators and discriminators. In this paper, we investigate the optimization effect of combining the Adam optimization algorithm and genetic algorithm on the GANs training process. In the experiment, we first use the Adam algorithm to pre-train GANs and then apply the genetic algorithm (GA) to further optimize the pre-trained model. The experimental results show that this combination method not only reduces the number of iterations required by the genetic algorithm through pre-training, thus saving the training time but also improves the performance of the training model. This shows that the use of a hybrid optimization strategy in complex network training is very effective and improves training efficiency.},

  abstract={Mammography is the leading methodology used to diagnose breast cancer. Effective, cheap and reliable, the mammography can be used to screen large populations, if the imagery produced can be analysed efficiently. State-of-the-art generative artificial intelligence approaches can be used to create tools able to aid in this task. Here we present a study focused on the emerging research topic of the application of generative diffusion models to the task of anomaly detection and we apply if for detecting anomalies on mammograms. Diffusion models exhibit promising results in making pixel-level predictions with image level annotations, but no such application has been published so far regarding mammography. We have, therefore, developed a novel approach utilizing U-net backbone that is able to generate mammograms with Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 14.62. We showed its ability to perform anomaly detection with Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.195 which demonstrates the viability of our approach for early-stage research.},

The research finds that in the context where intelligent online learning tools are involved in the learning process, the learning experience has a substantial impact on self-study abilities, and relying solely on usage cannot fully reflect students' learning autonomy. Therefore, it is suggested that universities should consciously introduce intelligent tools in course design to enhance students' information literacy and self-study abilities, to adapt to the new requirements of educational intelligence development.},

  abstract={Networks are a huge part of modern life, and cyber security has become a crucial area of research. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device that examines network traffic to confirm security, availability, and integrity. Despite years of research, conventional IDSs continue to struggle with enhancing detection performance, lowering False Alarm Rates (FAR), and identifying novel assaults. Many academics have concentrated on constructing IDSs that leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to overcome the difficulties mentioned above. With extreme accuracy, AI algorithms can reliably identify the main distinctions among normal and anomalous data. Furthermore, AI approaches are very generalizable, allowing them to identify previously undiscovered assaults. IDS methods based on ML, DL, and meta-heuristic optimization have recently been proposed as workable alternatives for spotting intrusions throughout the network. This survey presents an IDS taxonomy that classifies and summarizes AI-based IDS research using data items as the primary dimension. This article offers a thorough analysis of recent studies on the application of AI in IDSs, including surveys and suggestions for cutting-edge techniques. Following that, recent developments and advances in AI-based network IDS are explored, as well as the proposed strategy, assessment metrics, and dataset selection. This study highlighted many research obstacles and presented future direction for research in developing AI-based Network IDS using the inadequacies of the existing approaches.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence models are increasingly used in industrial applications to assist with predictive tasks. However, the complexity of industrial environments poses challenges to data collection, transmission, and storage, often leading to data loss and insufficiency. Synthetic data generation has become a common solution to augment datasets. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into traditional statistical techniques and deep generative approaches. Statistical methods explicitly model observed data, proving advantageous for simple, small-scale synthesis tasks. In contrast, deep generative methods implicitly model data and are capable of generating more complex datasets. Nevertheless, the data synthesized by deep generative models can be uncontrollable, with issues such as mode collapse. This paper proposes a novel data synthesis method based on the deep generative model TimeGAN, aimed at synthesizing multi-dimensional wind power time-series data. TimeGAN combines the architectures of GAN and AE (Autoencoder). The proposed method introduces a parallel structure of TCN (Temporal Convolutional Networks) and Transformer as the backbone of the generator and embedder. Additionally, Wasserstein divergence is used in place of KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence to calculate loss, effectively mitigating mode collapse during training. Comparative experiments with baseline algorithms, including TimeGAN and diffusion models, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, this work provides new insights into predictive tasks where data collection is difficult or incomplete.},

  abstract={Automatic image annotation, automatic image tagging, and image linguistic indexing functions use methodologies that significantly overlap. In this paper, we use the general term, image captioning, to refer to all forms of such functions. Image captioning is the process of automatically generating metadata in the form of captioning (i.e., generating sentences that describe the content of the image). Image captioning is used in image retrieval systems to locate images of interest from a database, web, or personal devices. In recent years, investigators have been using Deep Learning to caption images with some success. However, the reported results do suffer from a number of deficiencies; namely, accuracy, lack of diversity and emotions in resultant captions. In order to address some of these deficiencies, we propose to use Generative Adversarial models to produce new and combinatorial samples. More specifically, we propose to explore various autoencoders to generate more accurate and meaningful captions for images. Autoencoders are neural networks that learn data codings in an unsupervised manner. The research outlined in this paper is an ongoing investigative research project.},

  abstract={Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a common head and neck malignancy with distinct clinical management compared to other types of cancer. Precision risk stratification and tailored therapeutic interventions are crucial to improving the survival outcomes. Artificial intelligence, including radiomics and deep learning, has exhibited considerable efficacy in various clinical tasks for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. These techniques leverage medical images and other clinical data to optimize clinical workflow and ultimately benefit patients. In this review, we provide an overview of the technical aspects and basic workflow of radiomics and deep learning in medical image analysis. We then conduct a detailed review of their applications to seven typical tasks in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, covering various aspects of image synthesis, lesion segmentation, diagnosis, and prognosis. The innovation and application effects of cutting-edge research are summarized. Recognizing the heterogeneity of the research field and the existing gap between research and clinical translation, potential avenues for improvement are discussed. We propose that these issues can be gradually addressed by establishing standardized large datasets, exploring the biological characteristics of features, and technological upgrades.},

  abstract={This paper presents the recent advances in deeplearning (DL)-enabled methods for metacell and metalens design. On one hand, metamaterials or metasurfaces have been new opportunities for innovative antenna (metantennas) designs by increasing the degrees of freedom (DoF) in design through introducing new physical properties in antenna design. On the other hand, the increased DoF significantly increases the complexity of design procedure, demanding for new design methods. Prior-knowledge-guided deep-learning-enabled (PK-DL) synthesis method has been then proposed to alleviate this challenge. Prior knowledge is introduced into the conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (cDCGAN) algorithm to guide and speed up the proposed synthesis method. Then, two case studies are presented. The PK-DL synthesis method is first utilized to break the phaseshift limit up to 330 degrees from 308 degrees in existing techniques and improve the 1-dB gain bandwidth of metalens antennas by 52%. Secondly, both amplitude and phase responses of metacells are simultaneously synthesized in a single three-layered metasurface for a metalens antenna, realizing the sidelobe level suppression more than 30 dB. The latest progress demonstrates that the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to metantenna design and AI technologies provide a new opportunity in synthesizing metantennas with outstanding performances and multiple functions.},

  abstract={Generative AI, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that comprises models such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and large language models (LLMs), has demonstrated enormous promise in a variety of domains, including picture generation and language translation. Recently, its use in fraud detection and prevention has emerged as a viable area. Fraud, including financial fraud, identity theft, and cybercrime, costs billions of dollars each year, and standard detection systems are restricted by their inability to foresee new fraud trends. Generative AI takes a novel approach to this problem, improving fraud detection systems using anomaly detection, predictive modelling, and reinforcement learning. This paper analyses Generative AI in battling different fraud.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) and Requirements Engineering (RE) intersect in innovative and transformative ways, reshaping how we approach technology development today [1]. On the one hand, AI techniques, e.g., NLP, enhance RE processes by automating the extraction and analysis of requirements, increasing quality, accuracy and efficiency in translating human needs into technical specifications [2]. On the other hand, RE plays a crucial role in developing AI systems themselves; it ensures that AI technologies are designed with clear, well-defined requirements that align with ethical standards and practical user needs [1]. This symbiotic relationship not only advances the capabilities of AI but also ensures that the developed systems are human-centric, reliable and trustworthy [3]. AIRE workshop aims to explore this symbiotic relation to identify complex RE problems that could benefit from applying AI techniques and addressing RE for AI challenges. The 2024 workshop edition received 21 submissions, with each submission independently reviewed by at least three program committee members. The final program consisted of nine papers (seven regular research papers and two short papers) and one lightning talk. The workshop took place on June 25th, 2024. The workshop featured a keynote by Jan-Philipp Steghofer with the title “The proof is in the pudding-Real-world use cases for GenAI for Requirements Engineers.”, and a hands-on session on generative AI in RE. We are very grateful to the Program Committee members and authors of the submissions for their hard work and dedication in putting together this program. We thank you all for your participation in AIRE'24.},

  abstract={The increasing realism of images generated by artificial intelligence (AI) presents new challenges for digital literacy, particularly in distinguishing authentic content from synthetic creations. This paper presents the results of a public online quiz in which participants were asked to distinguish AI-generated images from real photographs. Each of the ten questions featured a pair of images—one original photograph and one AI-generated version created based on a textual description of the original. With over a hundred responses collected, the average score was 5.79 out of 10, with a median of 6, suggesting moderate success but also highlighting the difficulty many users had in discerning AI-generated content. The distribution of results showed a wide range of performance, with most participants scoring between 4 and 8 points. Some images were consistently misclassified, revealing patterns in human perception and AI-generated visual deception. These insights were used to design a workshop for high school and college students on AI in libraries, focusing on visual literacy and critical evaluation of digital media. The workshops include hands-on analysis of real and generated images and discussions on the role of libraries in boosting AI awareness. This paper discusses quiz results, educational strategies, and reflections from student engagement, emphasizing the importance of integrating AI literacy into broader digital education initiatives.},

  abstract={With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) technology, the field of industrial design is undergoing unprecedented transformations. By leveraging deep learning algorithms and generative models, AIGC tools can autonomously generate creative design solutions, offering designers inspiration and accelerating product development. However, the practical impact of AIGC tools differs significantly from traditional design methods. This study aims to compare and analyze the performance of AIGC tools versus traditional industrial design techniques in the generative design process, with a focus on evaluating differences in creativity, efficiency, design quality, and adaptability. Currently, AIGC tools on the market exhibit notable variations in their generative characteristics, and they have been widely adopted in fields such as product design, architectural planning, packaging design, and graphic design. However, no AIGC tools are specifically tailored for industrial equipment styling. Each AIGC tool operates on distinct algorithms and generative features, resulting in different output when processing the same content. Therefore, selecting high-quality, accurate AIGC design tools for industrial equipment design remains a challenging problem that requires further exploration.},
