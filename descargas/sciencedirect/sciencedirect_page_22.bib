abstract = {Aim
This study evaluated the understandability, actionability, and readability of text on anemia generated by artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.
Methods
This cross-sectional study compared texts generated by ChatGPT-3.5, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini at three levels: “normal,” “6th grade,” and “PEMAT-P version.” Additionally, texts retrieved from the top eight Google Search results for relevant keywords were included for comparison. All texts were written in Japanese. The Japanese version of the PEMAT-P was used to assess understandability and actionability, while jReadability was used for readability. A systematic comparison was conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each source.
Results
Texts generated by Gemini at the 6th-grade level (n = 26, 86.7 %) and PEMAT-P version (n = 27, 90.0 %), as well as ChatGPT-3.5 at the normal level (n = 21, 80.8 %), achieved significantly higher scores (≥70 %) for understandability and actionability compared to Google Search results (n = 17, 25.4 %, p < 0.001). For readability, Copilot and Gemini texts demonstrated significantly higher percentages of “very readable” to “somewhat difficult” levels than texts retrieved from Google Search (p = 0.000–0.007).
Innovation
This study is the first to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the understandability and actionability of educational materials on anemia prevention. By utilizing PEMAT-P and jReadability, the study demonstrated the superiority of Gemini in terms of understandability and readability through measurable data. This innovative approach highlights the potential of AI chatbots as a novel method for providing public health information and addressing health disparities.
Conclusion
AI-generated texts on anemia were found to be more readable and easier to understand than traditional web-based texts, with Gemini demonstrating the highest level of understandability. Moving forward, improvements in prompts will be necessary to enhance the integration of visual elements that encourage actionable responses in AI chatbots.}

abstract = {Oil transformers are one of the most widely used and vital equipment in power distribution networks. Therefore, in order to maintain the service of the electricity distribution system, special attention should be paid to the health and repairs of these equipment's in order to avoid possible costs due to their failure. Since the mineral oil used in these transformers is one of the strongest insulators, it needs a series of maintenance and periodic tests to increase the lifespan of the transformer. This paper proposes a new approach to provide an appropriate management decision and predict the remaining life of the mineral oil transformer using artificial intelligence. Health index formulation is a quick and efficient approach to combining various data and creating an indicator for asset management planning. While the health method using DGA is well presented in the literature, more attention should be paid to the combination with other parameters. Thus, in the proposed plan, evaluating the transformer's life with the actual health index formulation method includes additional factors such as load history, bush condition, ageing, and physical observations, along with common factors such as DGA, oil quality and dissolved gases in oil. Also, AI-based techniques have been used to increase accuracy. Furthermore, an integrated inspection and repair model is provided for maintenance management. Therefore, an optimal strategy is presented to determine the type of repair and inspection interval so that the transformer's life is managed by minimizing the total costs. Moreover, transformer faults are selected to manage the life of transformers and reduce blackouts. A model using transformer failure data has been developed to classify seven types of transformer faults. In order to validate the proposed procedure, the data collected for different transformers have been used. The results show that the proposed model is reliable and can provide a timely asset management decision with minimal cost.}

However, healthcare professionals often harbor concerns about AI-related job displacement, data security, and ethical implications, creating a perceived AI threat that may impede its widespread adoption. This study integrates the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology with perceived AI threat as both a direct and moderating factor, thereby examining how threat perceptions interact with established adoption drivers in the context of healthcare in Vietnam. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 573 healthcare professionals from major hospitals across Hanoi, Vietnam. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to test the proposed framework, which included performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), facilitating conditions (FC), and perceived AI threat. The results indicate that PE, EE, and SI had significant positive effects on behavioral intention, whereas FC was not a significant predictor. Perceived AI threat demonstrated a strong negative impact on adoption intentions, particularly by moderating and weakening the positive effects of PE and SI. The model explained 79.8 % of the variance in AI adoption intention, suggesting a substantial predictive power. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of addressing existential fears regarding AI in healthcare. Interventions targeting user training, transparent communication, and regulatory support may help mitigate perceived threats and harness AI's benefits.

Following PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed 144 peer-reviewed articles from Web of Science, Scopus, and ERIC databases to explore the field's progression, including identifying new developments, shifts in research priorities, and emerging themes that have arisen compared to the first year. The findings reveal an exponential growth in publications, with a significant shift from primarily exploratory inquiries to more systematic and empirically driven investigations. The analysis identified six main research foci: Perceptions and attitudes, psychological and cognitive aspects, teaching and learning strategies, language skills development, writing and feedback, and implementation and integration. While higher education (86.7 %) and English as Foreign Language contexts (86.1 %) dominated the research landscape, there was notable geographical diversity, with strong representation from East Asia and emerging contributions from the Middle East. Mixed-methods approaches (38.9 %) were prevalent, with increasing incorporation of AI-generated content, multimedia recordings, and digital interaction data from 2023 to 2024. Writing emerged as the primary focus (42.4 %) while speaking, listening, and reading skills received comparatively less attention. This review highlights critical gaps, including limited research in K-12 settings, insufficient longitudinal studies, and the need for more diverse language representation beyond English. These findings suggest the field is maturing but requires broader investigation across educational levels, language domains, and geographical contexts to fully understand the impact of generative AI in language education.}

This survey identifies seven shared dimensions between these two subfields of AI. These dimensions can be used to characterize different NeSy and StarAI systems. They are concerned with (1) the approach to logical inference, whether model or proof-based; (2) the syntax of the used logical theories; (3) the logical semantics of the systems and their extensions to facilitate learning; (4) the scope of learning, encompassing either parameter or structure learning; (5) the presence of symbolic and subsymbolic representations; (6) the degree to which systems capture the original logic, probabilistic, and neural paradigms; and (7) the classes of learning tasks the systems are applied to. By positioning various NeSy and StarAI systems along these dimensions and pointing out similarities and differences between them, this survey contributes fundamental concepts for understanding the integration of learning and reasoning.}

It shows how ChatGPT, a typical GAI, can affect practices, decision-making responsibility and the management disciplines through a dual discourse. The first one emanates from technological solutionism, a belief that any problem can be solved with the assistance of technology (the technosolutionist discourse), and the second one concerns the utterances generated by ChatGPT itself, which are shaped by various algorithmic, epistemic and linguistic influences (the generative discourse). In simpler terms, what ChatGPT can do to management appears to depend on “what is said about it” and “what it says”. In contrast to the existing literature on ChatGPT’s potential influence on organizations, this article, through its discursive approach, takes a non-normative position, to reveal the subtler influences of generative artificial intelligence, and highlight the individual and organizational responsibilities of actors interacting with these two discourses. The conclusions may be of interest to management readers in general, and of more particular interest to the accounting profession, as the conceptualization is based more broadly on examples taken from accounting, given the close link between the accounting profession and information technologies.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Large language models (LLM) hold significant promise to transform dairy science by enhancing research interpretation, supporting decision making, and improving knowledge dissemination. However, without proper systematic design, LLM may generate irrelevant or factually inaccurate responses for domain-specific questions. Moreover, most existing LLM and related tools are not tailored to the needs of the dairy domain, limiting their practical application within the field. To demonstrate the feasibility and practical value of embracing LLM in dairy science, we developed a 2-component agentic system: (1) a decision-support chatbot grounded in the Journal of Dairy Science (JDS) for science-backed insights and (2) a natural language interface for interacting with academic models and visualizing prediction results. All publicly available JDS abstracts and associated metadata dating back to 1917 were compiled using the PubMed application programming interface, forming a scientific knowledge base that enables the chatbot to answer user questions. A retrieval-augmented generation framework was implemented to ensure that responses generated by LLaMA (a LLM developed by Meta) were well-grounded in peer-reviewed literature, with the 5 most relevant sources cited alongside each answer. To address questions beyond the coverage of JDS literature, a web search agent was incorporated into the system to retrieve supplementary information from external online sources. Grading agents, powered by Databricks Research Transformer X (DBRX; a LLM developed by Databricks), were incorporated to evaluate the credibility and relevance of LLM-generated content to mitigate the risk of misinformation or hallucinated responses. The second component of the system facilitates natural language interaction with MilkBot, a published Bayesian milk yield prediction model. After users submit questions in plain language, the system converts the question into model parameters for MilkBot, executes the model prediction, and uses the predicted output to generate visualizations. This work demonstrates the capability of LLM to serve as intuitive, user-friendly interfaces for dairy-specific models. To our knowledge, this is the first chatbot prototype that integrates large-scale information from scientific literature, web-based resources, and academic models, along with self-evaluation capability, to provide dairy-specific insights to scholars, consultants, and farmers. However, challenges remain to realize the full value of LLM-assisted decision making, such as the lack of region-specific data to tailor the answers to the local circumstances, the need for more robust measures to protect data security and privacy, and the need to integrate additional functions to enable more comprehensive decision support.}

To thoroughly analyze factors affecting the generalization ability of deep learning algorithms on brain tumor detection and segmentation models.
Patients and Methods
We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and IEEE from inception to July 25, 2023, and 19 studies with 12,000 patients were identified. The criteria required studies to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for brain tumor detection and segmentation, offer clear performance metrics, and use external validation data sets. The study focused on outcomes such as sensitivity and Dice score. Study quality was assessed using QUADAS-2 and CLAIM tools. The meta-analysis evaluated varying algorithms and their performance across different validation data sets.
Results
MRI hardware as the manufacturer may contribute to data set diversity, impacting AI model generalizability. The study found that the best algorithms had a pooled lesion-wise Dice score of 84%, with pooled sensitivities of 87% (patient-wise) and 86% (lesion-wise). Post-2022 methodologies highlighted evolving artificial intelligence techniques. Performance differences were evident among tumor types, likely due to size disparities. 3D models outperformed their 2D and ensemble counterparts in detection. Although specific preprocessing techniques improved segmentation outcomes, some hindered detection.
Conclusion
The study underscores the potential of deep learning in improving brain tumor diagnostics and treatment planning. We also identify the need for further research, including developing a comprehensive diversity index, expanded meta-analyses, and using generative adversarial networks for data diversification, paving the way for AI-driven advancements in oncological patient care.

Despite major advances in many fields of science and technology, pharmaceutical research and development continues to be inefficient across multiple diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) trials are also subject to high failure rates. The aim of this review was to give an overview of the available literature on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for clinical trial facilitation across a variety of medical specialties before trying to best position AI in IBD clinical trials.
Methods
A scoping review was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) scoping reviews guidelines. The search strategy was performed using PubMed and combined the terms linked to “AI” and “clinical trials.” We included studies assessing the use of AI in transforming the key steps of the drug development process and clinical trials. Studies evaluating the use of AI for clinical purposes were excluded.
Results
In total, 80 articles were included. The rapid development of AI has great potential to transform the process of clinical development of new drugs in IBD, from screening of candidate molecules to study conception and execution, thereby enhancing trial efficiency. By improving the quality of trial design and facilitating patient selection, AI could help to decrease sample sizes and costs. AI may help to prescreen patients to facilitate—and possibly automate—trial enrollment. AI techniques could also help in patient monitoring by making adherence control more accurate, facilitating endpoint detection and real-time analysis.
Conclusions
Notwithstanding the ethical, regulatory, and practical limitations, incorporation of AI into clinical trials may accelerate and improve quality of drug development in IBD.}

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is a disruptive technology that has started to be used among students in management education. However, the question is whether the utilisation of GenAI in educational settings stimulates students to engage in learning activities and broaden their knowledge base. Hence, this study investigates student motivation and perception of using GenAI (ChatGPT) technology in management education. A random sampling technique was employed to survey 478 students from various educational institutions in the southern region of India. The outcomes revealed that GenAI presents both prospects and hurdles in the domain of management education. The disruptive nature of this technology brings forth numerous opportunities for acquiring knowledge and augmenting one's cognitive capacity. Nonetheless, a cautious and accountable approach is imperative for the successful integration of GenAI into the of management education. Consequently, this study provides pragmatic implications for students, educators, and educational institutions. The effectiveness of GenAI in practical settings can be heightened by arranging interactive training sessions led by AI experts, devising easily accessible online educational modules, embedding AI proficiencies into educators through collaborative endeavors or specialized training programs, and establishing systematic assessment protocols to ensure continual improvement.}

abstract = {The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in clinical settings—particularly in health documentation and communication—presents a largely unexplored but potentially transformative force in shaping placebo and nocebo effects. These psychosocial phenomena are especially potent in mental health care, where outcomes are closely tied to patients’ expectations, perceived provider competence, and empathy. Drawing on conceptual understanding of placebo and nocebo effects and the latest research, this Viewpoint argues that GenAI may amplify these effects, both positive and negative. Through tone, assurance, and even the rapidity of responses, GenAI-generated text—either co-written with clinicians or peers, or fully automated—could influence patient perceptions in ways that mental health clinicians may not currently fully anticipate. When embedded in clinician notes or patient-facing summaries, AI language may strengthen expectancies that underlie placebo effects, or conversely, heighten nocebo effects through subtle cues, inaccuracies, or potentially via loss of human nuance. This article explores the implications of AI-mediated clinical communication particularly in mental health care, emphasizing the importance of transparency, ethical oversight, and psychosocial awareness as these technologies evolve.}

Building on a comparison of the different ‘trainings’ of humans and LLMs, the paper first traces the seemingly human-like qualities of the LLM to the human proclivity to project communicative intent into or onto LLMs’ purely imitative capacity to predict the structure of human communication. It then goes on to detail the ways in which such human-like communication is deceptive and misleading in relation to the absolute ‘certainty’ with which LLMs ‘converse’, their intrinsic tendencies to ‘hallucination’ and ‘sycophancy’, the narrow conception of ‘artificial intelligence’, LLMs’ complete lack of ethical sensibility or capacity for responsibility, and finally the feared danger of an ‘emergence’ of ‘human-competitive’ or ‘superhuman’ LLM capabilities. The paper concludes by noting the potential dangers of the widespread use of LLMs as ‘mediators’ of human self-understanding and culture.

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced substantially in recent years, transforming many industries and improving the way people live and work. In scientific research, AI can enhance the quality and efficiency of data analysis and publication. However, AI has also opened up the possibility of generating high-quality fraudulent papers that are difficult to detect, raising important questions about the integrity of scientific research and the trustworthiness of published papers.
Objective
The aim of this study was to investigate the capabilities of current AI language models in generating high-quality fraudulent medical articles. We hypothesized that modern AI models can create highly convincing fraudulent papers that can easily deceive readers and even experienced researchers.
Methods
This proof-of-concept study used ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) powered by the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) language model to generate a fraudulent scientific article related to neurosurgery. GPT-3 is a large language model developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text in response to prompts given by users. The model was trained on a massive corpus of text from the internet and is capable of generating high-quality text in a variety of languages and on various topics. The authors posed questions and prompts to the model and refined them iteratively as the model generated the responses. The goal was to create a completely fabricated article including the abstract, introduction, material and methods, discussion, references, charts, etc. Once the article was generated, it was reviewed for accuracy and coherence by experts in the fields of neurosurgery, psychiatry, and statistics and compared to existing similar articles.
Results
The study found that the AI language model can create a highly convincing fraudulent article that resembled a genuine scientific paper in terms of word usage, sentence structure, and overall composition. The AI-generated article included standard sections such as introduction, material and methods, results, and discussion, as well a data sheet. It consisted of 1992 words and 17 citations, and the whole process of article creation took approximately 1 hour without any special training of the human user. However, there were some concerns and specific mistakes identified in the generated article, specifically in the references.
Conclusions
The study demonstrates the potential of current AI language models to generate completely fabricated scientific articles. Although the papers look sophisticated and seemingly flawless, expert readers may identify semantic inaccuracies and errors upon closer inspection. We highlight the need for increased vigilance and better detection methods to combat the potential misuse of AI in scientific research. At the same time, it is important to recognize the potential benefits of using AI language models in genuine scientific writing and research, such as manuscript preparation and language editing.}

Notably, such effects are reduced in consumer-human agent interactions and increased in consumer-AI ones (Study 4). Finally, interventions providing privacy guarantees can reduce privacy concerns stemming from powerful artificial agents and enhance willingness to disclose data (Study 5).

Effective methods for managing, diagnosing, and lessening the effects of COVID-19 are critical because, by 2024, the virus has already caused over 7 million deaths. In this study, we anatomize the impacts of the latest COVID-19 virus on patients with the help of computational intelligence, like Machine learning, artificial intelligence, and IoT-enabled technologies for managing, analyzing, diagnosing, and predicting COVID-19. With tools for early identification, risk assessment, and therapy optimization, machine learning and artificial intelligence have shown tremendous promise in the healthcare industry. These tools can examine big datasets to find patterns and trends that might not be noticeable to human observers. Additionally, IoT will enable healthcare firms to monitor patient scenarios properly and reduce the readmission of COVID-19 patients. Wearable sensors and remote monitoring systems are two examples of IoT-enabled gadgets that are vital for tracking the COVID-19 virus's spread and keeping an eye on its sufferers. These gadgets can gather data in real-time on environmental variables, symptoms, and vital signs, giving medical professionals important insights into the state of their patients' health and the course of their diseases.

This gap in AI literacy primary school education presents theoretical and pedagogical challenges. Despite the pervasive influence of AI, which can exacerbate inequalities and raise ethical challenges, primary students often lack an understanding of AI principles and mechanisms. Recent developments in age-appropriate AI learning tools have extended AI literacy to primary schools, but AI literacy frameworks for this age group remain underdeveloped. This study aims to conceptualize AI literacy by analyzing existing theoretical frameworks and proposing a new inclusive AI literacy framework for young students. A scoping review is employed using four credible index databases, and 19 articles are selected, with 17 AI literacy frameworks identified across all educational levels, from early childhood to university. This study reveals that the predominant methodologies for developing AI literacy frameworks involve empirical research studies and literature reviews, adhering to national government or institutional standards. These frameworks commonly incorporate 1) Bloom's taxonomy or a similar progression framework, such as Use-Create-Modify, 2) constructionism, and 3) computer science perspectives such as theories of computation. The findings reveal that AI literacy is situated at the intersection of digital literacy, data literacy, computational thinking, and AI ethics, emphasizing the need for a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach that encompasses both technological and societal impacts. However, the study argues that the current paradigms of AI literacy frameworks for young students often emphasize constructionist perspectives without fully considering the interactions between human and technological agents. This gap highlights the necessity for a new conceptual framework that acknowledges both human and non-human agents in AI literacy education for young students.

This study aimed to develop a prediction tool to identify abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) at increased risk of rupture incorporating demographic, clinical, imaging, and medication data using artificial intelligence (AI).
Design
A development and validation study for individual prognosis using AI in a case-control design.
Methods
From two Danish hospitals, all available ruptured AAA cases between January 2009 and December 2016 were included in a ratio of 1:2 with elective surgery controls. Cases with previous AAA surgery or missing preoperative scans were excluded. Features from computed tomography angiography scans and hospital records were manually retrieved. The sample was divided randomly and evenly into developmental and internal validation groups. A SHapley Additive exPlanations Feature Importance Rank Ensembling (SHAPFire) AI tool was developed using a gradient boosting decision tree framework. The final SHAPFire AI model was compared with models using (1) solely infrarenal anterior-posterior diameter and (2) all available features.
Results
The study included 637 individuals (84.8% men, mean age 73 ± 7 years, 213 ruptured AAAs). The SHAPFire AI incorporated 20 of 68 available features, and aneurysm size, blood pressure, and relationships between height and weight were given highest rankings. The receiver operating characteristic curve for the SHAPFire AI model displayed a significant increase in accuracy identifying ruptured AAA cases compared with the conventional model based solely on diameter with areas under the curves of 0.86 ± 0.04 and 0.74 ± 0.03 (P = .008), respectively. SHAPFire AI was comparable in performance with the model using all features.
Conclusions
This study successfully developed a SHAPFire AI tool to identify AAAs at increased risk of rupture with significantly higher accuracy than diameter alone. External validation of the model is warranted before clinical implementation.}

abstract = {Background and Aims
Esophageal varices (EVs) result from portal hypertension in decompensated liver disease secondary to liver cirrhosis. Diagnosis and grading is done using EGD and mucosal examination. However, interobserver differences may occur when analyzing EGD results. Recent application of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms yielded mixed results for varices detection and bleeding risk estimation. The capabilities of AI in the detection and grading of EVs need to be evaluated.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE were searched from January 1956 to July 2023. Data were manually identified and extracted by reviewers, assessing outcomes of AI tools used, EV detection accuracies, and bleeding risk prediction accuracies. Average accuracies were derived from result sections or manual calculations.
Results
Sixteen studies with 26,170 patients and 19 AI systems and algorithms were included after a review of 1670 studies. The most common AI systems were artificial neural network and random forest. The categorical boosting machine learning (ML) algorithm was most accurate for prediction of bleeding (100%), whereas the radiomic model ML tool was the least accurate for EV detection (49%). Overall, AI had an average EV detection accuracy of 78.67% and variceal bleed accuracy of 83.2%.
Conclusions
AI could provide an accessible interface for EV prediction and estimation of bleeding risk. Limitations include the dependence on a single dataset for efficacy, assessment with specific AI tools, and potential overinterpretation of broad geographic variances. Newer algorithms should have larger datasets with reproducible validity to strengthen the predictive value in clinical practice.}

abstract = {Smart Manufacturing (SM) is an important factor for driving innovation, enhancing operational efficiency, and increasing sustainable industrial growth in an increasingly competitive and resource-constrained world. However, it faces several challenges related to increasing energy consumption and climate change. The high energy demands of connected devices and robotic manipulators increase the carbon footprint. To resolve this issue, most enterprises are now transitioning to use Renewable Energy Sources (RES), and optimizing their power and energy usage, while holding the process efficient. To fully achieve this transition, a detailed power modeling of the robotic manufacturing system is crucial and, therefore, it is important to investigate this power modeling of the robotic manipulators’ consumption in a Smart Sustainable Manufacturing (SSM) to achieve the best power modeling results and better integrability analytics in optimal power planning of the robotic systems power supply. To this end, this paper presents a deep Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)-based modeling of robotic manipulators’ power supply interaction with the power grid, and RES. In the proposed system, which is powered by solar energy and the power grid, a SSM equipped with ten 6-Degrees of Freedom (DoF) robotic manipulators is considered in the presence of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs). Subsequently, a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) is employed to generate synthetic data for the system alongside the real data, thereby expanding the analytical horizons across varying operational characteristics of the system. Following this, a Residual Networks (ResNet) is developed to comprehensively analyze and predictively model the power consumption of the manipulators and their interactions with the power supply resources. Finally, the proposed hybrid GAI modeling strategy is numerically evaluated across a broad spectrum of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (MSE= 10−4, MAE= 3.6×10−3, R2= 99.98%, MARE= 1.97×10−2, RMSPE= 8.83×10−2%, MSRE= 7.8×10−3, RMSRE= 8.84×10−2, MAPE= 1.97×10−2%, and Max Error= 2.04×10−2), where these metrics demonstrate superior performance in power modeling. As a result, the concept of Grid-to-Robot (G2R) is introduced for the first time as a foundation for further advancements in SSM, enhancing sustainability and mitigating negative impacts on climate change while contributing to the development of an advanced manufacturing system.}

We tackle the archetypical task of learning the eigenvalues of the state-transition matrix of a linear (discrete-time, stable) dynamical system, from output data. We train a scalable LSTM neural network with artificially generated data from random matrices of dimension 2-to-5. With noise-free data, the performance of the trained network is very good (average R2=0.955), especially in estimating the dominant eigenvalues, whereas there is space for improvements on non-dominant real eigenvalues and on the dimension of the generating matrix. Remarkably, the performance is robust to measurement noise and the network outperforms the mean-square identification of the corresponding AR process (the latter giving exact eigenvalues on noise-free data) at noise standard deviation starting from 10−6.}

abstract = {Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disease affecting the central nervous system. MS diagnosis is complex, requiring magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis due to the lack of definitive biomarkers. Although treatment advancements have reduced disability, diagnostic and therapeutic challenges remain, even among MS-specialized neurologists. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, which analyze large datasets, are increasingly used in healthcare, especially for diagnosis and treatment.
Objectives
This study aims to assess the accuracy and scope of knowledge regarding MS, focusing on diagnosis, treatment options and management strategies, as tested among neurologists and AI bots.
Methods
Twenty multiple-choice questions, developed by MS-experienced neurology academics, were administered to 37 neurology specialists and 79 neurology residents in Turkey. The same questions were posed to AI platforms, including ChatGPT-4.0, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5, Perplexity, and Perplexity Pro.
Results
Neurology specialists answered 12.05 ± 4.01 questions correctly on average, while residents scored 9.08 ± 3.41. Among residents with more than two years of training, the correct answer rate improved to 11.96 ± 3.5. Specialists active in MS clinics scored significantly higher than other neurologists (17.67 ± 1.75). AI platforms scored between 14 and 19 out of 20; with an average of 17.0 ± 1.79 with Claude 3.5 scoring highest.
Conclusion
The findings suggest AI holds promise in supporting MS diagnosis and treatment, though challenges remain in nuanced cases. While AI complements neurologists, further studies are essential to understand its potential and limitations.

To identify peri- and post-menopausal women at risk of non-communicable diseases in rural India and to assess their prevalence amongst these groups via the use of artificial intelligence.
Settings and design
An observational study conducted by the Indian Menopause Society in collaboration with the Government of Maharashtra. The study included rural women residents of three villages in the Latur district of Maharashtra, India.
Materials and methods
Accredited social health activist workers identified 400 peri- and post-menopausal women aged 45–60 years. Specific symptoms able to predict the presence of a non-communicable disease were identified through the use of artificial intelligence.
Statistical analysis used
Descriptive statistics and predictive network charts analysis.
Results
The mean age of 316 women included in the analysis was 50.4 years and the majority of them were illiterate (68 %). The prevalence of dyslipidaemia, osteopenia, diabetes mellitus, obesity and hypertension were 58 %, 50 %, 25 %, 25 %, and 20 % respectively. None of their symptoms or laboratory reports could be significantly correlated directly with any of these non-communicable diseases. Hence, we used a cluster of symptoms to suggest the presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis and hypothyroidism via predictive network analysis charts.
Conclusions
Screening of at-risk women can be done using an artificial intelligence-based screening tool for early diagnosis, timely referral and treatment of non-communicable diseases with the support of community health workers.}

However, this critical task remains manual, time-consuming, and prone to human error and subjective interpretation. Additionally, traditional methods, such as cytometers, can introduce inaccuracies that compromise data analysis. To address these challenges, researchers are increasingly turning to automated counting techniques. In response, we have developed an artificial intelligence-enabled predictive system for automated cell counting called the Patch-Based Supervised Cytometry Regression (PB-SCR) system. This system provides high accuracy and ease of use and is designed for universal cell counting applications, including Escherichia coli (E. coli), significantly reducing the workload for researchers. By integrating machine learning algorithms for data collection and analysis, we optimized a USB camera for image capture. We adopted patch learning combined with ensemble approaches, implementing five regression models: ridge regression, gradient boosting regression, support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbor regression, and adaptive boosting regression. Among these models, SVR demonstrated the best performance, achieving a root mean squared error of 0.53, R-square of 0.87, mean squared error of 0.34, and mean absolute error of 0.38. The system achieved an average accuracy of 95.40 % ± 3.01 %. A state-of-the-art comparison between our proposed framework and the OpenCFU solution demonstrated an 8.5 % improvement in performance. Finally, our PB-SCR system shows promising potential for future applications, including cancer cell recognition.}

Background
While the buttock region is considered an esthetic hallmark, the Brazilian butt lift (BBL) remains controversially discussed in the plastic surgery community. This is due to its contentious safety profile. Thus, informed consent and patient education play a key role in preoperative planning. To this end, we aimed to program an easy-to-use, widely accessible, and low-budget algorithm that produces reliable outcome simulations.
Methods
The conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) was trained using pre- and postoperative images from 1628 BBL patients. To validate outcome simulation, 25 GAN-generated images were assessed deploying 67 Amazon Mechanical Turk Workers (Mturks).
Results
Mturks could not differentiate between GAN-generated and real patient images in approximately 49.4% of all trials.
Conclusion
This study presents a free-to-use, widely accessible, and reliable algorithm to visualize potential surgical outcomes that could potentially be applied in other fields of plastic surgery.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in health care have been effective in many areas of medicine, but they are often trained for a single task using labelled data, making deployment and generalisability challenging. How well a general-purpose AI language model performs diagnosis and triage relative to physicians and laypeople is not well understood.
Methods
We compared the predictive accuracy of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3)'s diagnostic and triage ability for 48 validated synthetic case vignettes (<50 words; sixth-grade reading level or below) of both common (eg, viral illness) and severe (eg, heart attack) conditions to a nationally representative sample of 5000 lay people from the USA who could use the internet to find the correct options and 21 practising physicians at Harvard Medical School. There were 12 vignettes for each of four triage categories: emergent, within one day, within 1 week, and self-care. The correct diagnosis and triage category (ie, ground truth) for each vignette was determined by two general internists at Harvard Medical School. For each vignette, human respondents and GPT-3 were prompted to list diagnoses in order of likelihood, and the vignette was marked as correct if the ground-truth diagnosis was in the top three of the listed diagnoses. For triage accuracy, we examined whether the human respondents’ and GPT-3's selected triage was exactly correct according to the four triage categories, or matched a dichotomised triage variable (emergent or within 1 day vs within 1 week or self-care). We estimated GPT-3's diagnostic and triage confidence on a given vignette using a modified bootstrap resampling procedure, and examined how well calibrated GPT-3's confidence was by computing calibration curves and Brier scores. We also performed subgroup analysis by case acuity, and an error analysis for triage advice to characterise how its advice might affect patients using this tool to decide if they should seek medical care immediately.
Findings
Among all cases, GPT-3 replied with the correct diagnosis in its top three for 88% (42/48, 95% CI 75–94) of cases, compared with 54% (2700/5000, 53–55) for lay individuals (p<0.0001) and 96% (637/666, 94–97) for physicians (p=0·012). GPT-3 triaged 70% correct (34/48, 57–82) versus 74% (3706/5000, 73–75; p=0.60) for lay individuals and 91% (608/666, 89–93%; p<0.0001) for physicians. As measured by the Brier score, GPT-3 confidence in its top prediction was reasonably well calibrated for diagnosis (Brier score=0·18) and triage (Brier score=0·22). We observed an inverse relationship between case acuity and GPT-3 accuracy (p<0·0001) with a fitted trend line of –8·33% decrease in accuracy for every level of increase in case acuity. For triage error analysis, GPT-3 deprioritised truly emergent cases in seven instances.
Interpretation
A general-purpose AI language model without any content-specific training could perform diagnosis at levels close to, but below, physicians and better than lay individuals. We found that GPT-3's performance was inferior to physicians for triage, sometimes by a large margin, and its performance was closer to that of lay individuals. Although the diagnostic performance of GPT-3 was comparable to physicians, it was significantly better than a typical person using a search engine.

We critically examine AI’s capability to replicate core therapeutic components, such as empathy, embodied mentalizing, biobehavioral synchrony, and reciprocal mentalizing. Although current AI systems, especially large language models, demonstrate significant potential in simulating emotional responsiveness, cognitive empathy, and therapeutic dialogue, fundamental limitations persist. AI’s inherent lack of genuine emotional presence, reciprocal intentionality, and affective commitment constrains its ability to foster authentic epistemic trust and meaningful therapeutic relationships. Additionally, we outline significant risks, notably for individuals with complex trauma or relational vulnerabilities, highlighting concerns regarding pseudo-empathy, mistaking phenomenal experience for objective reality (psychic equivalence), fruitless ungrounded pursuit of social understanding (hypermentalization), and epistemic exploitation of individuals in whom artificial understanding by AI triggers excessive credulity. Nonetheless, we propose ethically informed pathways for integrating AI to enhance clinical practice, therapist training, and client care, particularly in augmenting human capacities within group and adjunctive therapy contexts. Paradoxically, AI could support psychotherapists in improving their capacity to mentalize, improve their understanding of their clients, and provide such understanding within the moral constraints that normally govern their work. This paper calls for careful ethical regulation similar to that limiting genetic manipulation, interdisciplinary research, and clinician involvement in shaping future AI-based psychotherapeutic models, emphasizing that AI’s role should complement rather than replace the irreplaceable relational core of psychotherapy.}

However, recent advancements in state-of-the-art image generation methods have significantly challenged the ability to differentiate AIG images from natural photographs (NP). To address this issue, a novel approach based on deep trace representations and dual-branch interactive feature fusion is presented. Firstly, a global feature extraction module that leverages attention-based MobileViT (AT-MobileViT) is designed to learn the deep representations of the global trace information. Besides, we apply multiple enhanced residual blocks to extract discriminative multi-scale features. After that, a low-level feature extraction module incorporating a channel-spatial attention (CSA) block is also carefully employed to enhance the learning of trace representations. To facilitate the capture of complementary information between features, a dual-branch interactive feature fusion module is introduced by reshaping feature vectors into interactive matrices. By conducting experiments on both seen and unseen images, results demonstrate the better performance and robustness of the proposed method.}

The Longevity Games Interview Simulator provides an innovative approach to preparing students for real-world research interactions by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Claude-3.7. This paper outlines the development and demonstrates the benefits of the simulator, designed to mimic interviews with older adults to enhance students’ interviewing skills, empathy, and cultural competence. Key outcomes included preparing students for real-world interactions with interview subjects, improving their ability to identify and properly document protected health information (PHI), gaining experience in asking relevant follow-up questions, and directing conversations to achieve interview goals. The simulator used generative AI models to create realistic interview scenarios based on demographic data from Rochester, NY. Components of the simulator included a student interview-question selection and creation portion, an interview-guide worksheet, a post-simulation quiz on the materials, and a reflective exercise focusing on information gathering and ethical considerations regarding PHI. This tool was designed for the Science of Aging course’s CURE (Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience) to provide students with practical, repeatable interview practice. A small pilot study with senior nursing students indicated that the simulator improved students’ confidence, preparedness, and understanding of ethical considerations. This paper also discusses how the simulator has potential for adaptation across educational contexts and encourages educators to develop their own custom interview simulations.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) has an important significance in the construction of smart grids. There is a problem of low accuracy of behavior detection due to a large number of attacks and long data fragments in the power grid data. In this paper, a behavior detection method based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed. The method focuses on optimizing the learning strategies of the generator and discriminator based on a GAN. In this regard, the loss function is converged by maximizing the root mean square error of the attack in the discriminator, and the linear activation function is used as the modulation function before the output in the generator. Therefore, the improved GAN can utilize the data enhancement features in the original mode and ensure the stability of attack behavior recognition, and then, effectively detect the attack information in the grid. The experimental results show that the method in this paper can accurately and effectively monitor abnormal attack behavior in the embedded terminals of the smart grid, and its effective detection rate is 97.6%.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is experiencing unprecedented innovation and transformation, potentially attributed to intimate interactions between science and technology (S&T) within the field. To identify S&T linkages and detect intrinsic interactions within AI, this paper introduces a network portrait divergence approach, where S&T knowledge networks are prototyped as two-dimensional network portraits based on graph-invariant probability distributions, and comparing them by coupling network portrait divergence with knowledge content. Specifically, S&T knowledge of AI is first extracted and unified through KeyBERT and word-alignment algorithms. Subsequently, temporal S&T knowledge networks are constructed and visualized as two network portraits: node portraits and edge-weight portraits. Network portrait divergence, an information-theoretic, graph-like measure for comparing networks, is applied to calculate varying S&T portrait divergences. Finally, internal knowledge flows within S&T and dynamic interactions between them are unearthed based on multiscale backbone analysis. Empirical experiments on both synthetic networks (random graph ensembles) and real-world AI datasets underscore the feasibility and reliability of the network portrait divergence approach.}

abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to find information. Providing accurate information is essential to support patients with cancer and their families; however, information returned by generative AIs is sometimes wrong. Returning wrong information is called hallucination. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which supplements large language model (LLM) outputs with relevant external sources, has the potential to reduce hallucinations. Although RAG has been proposed as a promising technique, its real-world performance in public health communication remains underexplored.
Objective
This study aimed to examine cancer information returned by generative AIs with RAG using cancer-specific information sources and general internet searches to determine whether using RAG with reliable information sources reduces the hallucination rates of generative AI chatbots.
Methods
We developed 6 types of chatbots by combining 3 patterns of reference information with 2 versions of LLMs. Thus, GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 chatbots that use cancer information service (CIS) information, Google information, and no reference information (conventional chatbots) were developed. A total of 62 cancer-related questions in Japanese were compiled from public sources. All responses were generated automatically and independently reviewed by 2 experienced clinicians. The reviewers assessed the presence of hallucinations, defined as medically harmful or misinformation. We compared hallucination rates across chatbot types and calculated odds ratios (OR) using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Subgroup analyses were also performed based on whether questions were covered by CIS content.
Results
For the chatbots that used information from CIS, the hallucination rates were 0% for GPT-4 and 6% for GPT-3.5, whereas those for chatbots that used information from Google were 6% and 10% for GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, respectively. For questions on information that is not issued by CIS, the hallucination rates for Google-based chatbots were 19% for GPT-4 and 35% for GPT-3.5. The hallucination rates for conventional chatbots were approximately 40%. Using reference data from Google searches generated more hallucinations than using CIS data, with an OR of 9.4 (95% CI 1.2‐17.5, P<.01); the OR for the conventional chatbot was 16.1 (95% CI 3.7‐50.0, P<.001). While conventional chatbots always generated a response, the RAG-based chatbots sometimes declined to answer when information was lacking. The conventional chatbots responded to all questions, but the response rate decreased (36% to 81%) for RAG-based chatbots. For questions on information not covered by CIS, the CIS chatbots did not respond, while the Google chatbots generated responses in 52% of the cases for GPT-4 and 71% for GPT-3.5.
Conclusions
Using RAG with reliable information sources significantly reduces the hallucination rate of generative AI chatbots and increases the ability to admit lack of information, making them more suitable for general use, where users need to be provided with accurate information.}

These AI systems may operate autonomously, support human decision-makers or increasingly act as collaborative team members. However, data-driven AI systems often function as black boxes, lacking interpretability. This poses a challenge in decision-making, as stakeholders involved in or impacted by the decision-making process frequently need to understand the rationale behind decisions. Moreover, data-driven AI systems operate without leveraging structured domain knowledge. As a result, data-driven AI systems may generate outputs that are misaligned with the decision context, objectives, or constraints, potentially leading to poor decisions or reduced trust in AI systems among users. Consequently, recent years have seen an increasing interest in integrating domain knowledge with data-driven AI. This is evident in neuro-symbolic AI, a subfield of AI that combines neural networks with symbolic AI. While this approach shows promise for enhancing the trustworthiness of AI systems in decision-making, the specific mechanisms by which domain knowledge integration contributes to dimensions of trustworthiness remain insufficiently explored. Therefore, this study reviews and integrates recent knowledge- and data-driven AI literature, along with relevant concepts for decision-making. Building on this foundation, it proposes a lifecycle framework for integrated knowledge- and data-driven AI systems for decision-making, and demonstrates its application through a healthcare application example. It further analyses the dimensions of trustworthiness for knowledge- and data-driven AI systems using the proposed lifecycle framework and application example.

Review articles play a critical role in informing medical decisions and identifying avenues for future research. With the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI), there has been a growing interest in the potential of this technology to transform the synthesis of medical literature. Open AI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-4) (Open AI Inc, San Francisco, CA) tool provides access to advanced AI that is able to quickly produce medical literature following only simple prompts. The accuracy of the generated articles requires review, especially in subspecialty fields like Allergy/Immunology.
Objective
To critically appraise AI-synthesized allergy-focused minireviews.
Methods
We tasked the GPT-4 Chatbot with generating 2 1,000-word reviews on the topics of hereditary angioedema and eosinophilic esophagitis. Authors critically appraised these articles using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool for text and opinion and additionally evaluated domains of interest such as language, reference quality, and accuracy of the content.
Results
The language of the AI-generated minireviews was carefully articulated and logically focused on the topic of interest; however, reviewers of the AI-generated articles indicated that the AI-generated content lacked depth, did not appear to be the result of an analytical process, missed critical information, and contained inaccurate information. Despite being provided instruction to utilize scientific references, the AI chatbot relied mainly on freely available resources, and the AI chatbot fabricated references.
Conclusions
The AI holds the potential to change the landscape of synthesizing medical literature; however, apparent inaccurate and fabricated information calls for rigorous evaluation and validation of AI tools in generating medical literature, especially on subjects associated with limited resources.}

While AI interventions continue to raise ethical concerns around privacy, transparency, autonomy, and other related ones, this could potentially impact the overall effectiveness of these interventions in the healthy eating domain. Hence, in this book chapter, we present results from a systematic review of articles published from 2013 to 24. Results from our review show that while 77% have shown the effectiveness of AI interventions in this domain, there are several limitations, including no follow-up studies and ethical considerations that need to be addressed to conclude on their long-term effectiveness. Hence, we provide recommendations for advancing research in designing AI-driven health interventions in future work.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has played a vital role in computer-aided drug design (CADD). This development has been further accelerated with the increasing use of machine learning (ML), mainly deep learning (DL), and computing hardware and software advancements. As a result, initial doubts about the application of AI in drug discovery have been dispelled, leading to significant benefits in medicinal chemistry. At the same time, it is crucial to recognize that AI is still in its infancy and faces a few limitations that need to be addressed to harness its full potential in drug discovery. Some notable limitations are insufficient, unlabeled, and non-uniform data, the resemblance of some AI-generated molecules with existing molecules, unavailability of inadequate benchmarks, intellectual property rights (IPRs) related hurdles in data sharing, poor understanding of biology, focus on proxy data and ligands, lack of holistic methods to represent input (molecular structures) to prevent pre-processing of input molecules (feature engineering), etc. The major component in AI infrastructure is input data, as most of the successes of AI-driven efforts to improve drug discovery depend on the quality and quantity of data, used to train and test AI algorithms, besides a few other factors. Additionally, data-gulping DL approaches, without sufficient data, may collapse to live up to their promise. Current literature suggests a few methods, to certain extent, effectively handle low data for better output from the AI models in the context of drug discovery. These are transferring learning (TL), active learning (AL), single or one-shot learning (OSL), multi-task learning (MTL), data augmentation (DA), data synthesis (DS), etc. One different method, which enables sharing of proprietary data on a common platform (without compromising data privacy) to train ML model, is federated learning (FL). In this review, we compare and discuss these methods, their recent applications, and limitations while modeling small molecule data to get the improved output of AI methods in drug discovery. Article also sums up some other novel methods to handle inadequate data.}

While there is a substantial corpus of research into design-event analysis, the arrival of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has opened a new portal into describing and distilling the complex ocean environment into something controllable for the engineer to create new realistic ocean environments that can be used for extreme event observation and calculation. In this paper a generative AI method, called GenWave, is presented that shares the same principle as large-language modeling. The method learns the phase relationships in filtered wave data sets so that new wave fields can be generated on demand. GenWaveis based on recurrent neural nets, and it is cast into a bootstrapping algorithm to generate focused wave fields of increasing amplitude. The method is used to generate large waves for both a Gaussian linear water wave, and a non-Gaussian second-order water wave. The comparison of the distributions of phases for the generative AI model to those from Monte-Carlo simulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the method to create new dangerous wave fields for time-domain simulation or laboratory experiment.}

abstract = {Objectives
Traditional cephalometric radiographs depict a three-dimensional structure in a two-dimensional plane; therefore, errors may occur during a quantitative assessment. Cone beam computed tomography, on the other hand, minimizes image distortion, allowing essential areas to be observed without overlap. Artificial intelligence can be used to enhance low-dose cone beam computed tomography images. This study aimed to clinically validate the use of artificial intelligence-processed low-dose cone beam computed tomography for generating two-dimensional lateral cephalometric radiographs by comparing these artificial intelligence-enhanced radiographs with traditional two-dimensional lateral cephalograms and those derived from standard cone beam computed tomography.
Methods
Sixteen participants who had previously undergone both cone beam computed tomography and plain radiography were selected. Group I included standard lateral cephalometric radiographs. Group II included cone beam computed tomography-produced lateral cephalometric radiographs, and Group III included artificial intelligence-processed low-dose cone beam computed tomography-produced lateral cephalometric radiographs. Lateral cephalometric radiographs of the three groups were analyzed using an artificial intelligence-based cephalometric analysis platform.
Results
A total of six angles and five lengths were measured for dentofacial diagnosis. There were no significant differences in measurements except for nasion-menton among the three groups.
Conclusions
Low-dose cone beam computed tomography could be an efficient method for cephalometric analyses in dentofacial treatment. Artificial intelligence-processed low-dose cone beam computed tomography imaging procedures have the potential in a wide range of dental applications. Further research is required to develop artificial intelligence technologies capable of producing acceptable and effective outcomes in various clinical situations.
Clinical significance
Replacing standard cephalograms with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) to evaluate the craniofacial relationship has the potential to significantly enhance the diagnosis and treatment of selected patients. The effectiveness of low-dose (LD)-CBCT was assessed in this study. The results indicated that lateral cephalograms reconstructed using LD-CBCT were comparable to standard lateral cephalograms.}

Grounded in anthropomorphism theory—the attribution of human characteristics to non-human entities— this research explores how human-like qualities of AI singing voices influence empathy and acceptance. Utilizing a quantitative research design with 310 participants, this study employs partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the effects of anthropomorphic factors, such as animacy, humanlike fit, and perceived sociability, on the likeability of AI-generated singing. The findings indicate that animacy and humanlike fit significantly enhance likeability, which, in turn, influences the intention to use AI-generated singing. Curiosity and word of mouth (WoM) emerged as key drivers of acceptance. This study builds on the traditional technology acceptance models (TAM, UTAUT2) by proposing a framework that integrates human-related factors, thereby demonstrating the necessity of adapting existing models to better evaluate AI systems in creative domains. These insights contribute to advancing the understanding of human-computer interaction, particularly within the evolving landscape of AI-driven creative processes.}

Hospitals encounter challenges in managing bed capacity due to patient surges, limited bed availability, and staffing shortages, which cause delays in care and are intensified by seasonal fluctuations. This study introduces a novel two-phase methodology for hospital bed allocation that tailors artificial intelligence techniques, combining machine learning models with a mathematical optimization framework. In the first phase, several artificial intelligence-driven models estimate patients' length of stay using demographic and clinical attributes. The gradient boosting model outperformed the others, achieving 96.58 % accuracy, 96.57 % F-score, and 0.965 area under the curve. Accurate prediction enables hospitals to allocate beds more effectively, identify patients at high risk of prolonged stays, and ensure that patients receive appropriate care. In the second phase, the predicted length of stay is incorporated into an integer linear programming model to optimize bed assignment, considering factors such as minimizing patient transfers, ensuring medical isolation, and adhering to age-based room assignment policies. To address the uncertainty in the length of stay predictions, chance-constrained stochastic programming is employed, making this study one of the first to integrate length of stay forecasting with robust bed assignments. The method's applicability and effectiveness are demonstrated through a real-world case study at a pediatric hospital in Gorgan City, Iran. The results indicate the proposed model's potential to enhance bed management through no bed shortage, significant improvement in patient transfers, and approximately 20 % reduction in hospitalization delays compared to current practices.}

Although Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) (OpenAI) may be an appealing educational resource for students, the chatbot responses can be subject to misinformation. This study was designed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on a board-style multiple-choice dental knowledge assessment to gauge its capacity to output accurate dental content and in turn the risk of misinformation associated with use of the chatbot as an educational resource by dental students.
Methods
ChatGPT3.5 and ChatGPT4 were asked questions obtained from 3 different sources: INBDE Bootcamp, ITDOnline, and a list of board-style questions provided by the Joint Commission on National Dental Examinations. Image-based questions were excluded, as ChatGPT only takes text-based inputs. The mean performance across 3 trials was reported for each model.
Results
ChatGPT3.5 and ChatGPT4 answered 61.3% and 76.9% of the questions correctly on average, respectively. A 2-tailed t test was used to compare 2 independent sample means, and a 2-tailed χ2 test was used to compare 2 sample proportions. A P value less than .05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Conclusion
ChatGPT3.5 did not perform sufficiently well on the board-style knowledge assessment. ChatGPT4, however, displayed a competent ability to output accurate dental content. Future research should evaluate the proficiency of emerging models of ChatGPT in dentistry to assess its evolving role in dental education.
Practical Implications
Although ChatGPT showed an impressive ability to output accurate dental content, our findings should encourage dental students to incorporate ChatGPT to supplement their existing learning program instead of using it as their primary learning resource.}

abstract = {Background
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into pharmacy practice has the potential to advance learning experiences and prepare future pharmacists for evolving healthcare needs. However, it also raises ethical considerations that need to be addressed carefully. This study aimed to explore pharmacy students' attitudes regarding AI integration into their future pharmacy practice.
Methods
A cross-sectional design was employed, utilizing a validated online questionnaire administered to pharmacy students from diverse demographic backgrounds in multiple countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region from August 2022 to January 2023. Demographic, education, and work information data were, respectively, collected from study participants. In addition, technology literacy and AI familiarity were collected using a Likert scale on skill and a Likert scale on familiarity. Finally, participants' concerns and perceived barriers regarding AI integration were collected based on a Likert scale on agreement.
Results
A total of 702 pharmacy students participated in the study, with the majority being female (72.8 %), enrolled in public universities (55.6 %), and not employed (64.2 %). Participants expressed a generally negative attitude towards AI integration, where 56.2–70.8 % of respondents agreed/strongly agreed to concerns/barriers including patient data privacy (62.0 %), susceptibility to hacking (56.2 %), potential job displacement (69.3 %), cost limitations (66.8 %), access (69.1 %), the absence of regulations (68.1 %), and training (70.4 %), physicians' reluctance (65.1 %), and patient apprehension (70.8 %). Factors including country of residence, academic year, cumulative GPA, work status, technology literacy, and AI understanding influenced participants' attitudes. Positive correlations were found between attitude score and tech-savviness (r = 0.174), and AI understanding (r = 0.155).
Conclusion
Pharmacy students from multiple countries in the MENA region express significant ethical and practical concerns about AI's integration into their future practice. These findings underscore the need for incorporating AI education within pharmacy curricula, alongside the development of robust ethical guidelines and regulatory policies. Addressing students' concerns is crucial to ensuring ethical, equitable, and beneficial AI integration in future pharmacy practice.}

abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution has brought about key technological breakthroughs represented by artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain (BC), which provide an opportunity for the development of clean energy (CE). We employ a wavelet-based quantile-on-quantile approach to investigate the correlation among AI, BC and CE over different periods and time horizons. The results show that although the integration of AI and CE systems requires a lot of time, it can significantly boost CE development in the long run. However, BC cannot significantly promote CE development except for a few extreme periods. Our results are supported by the mechanism of interaction among AI, BC and CE development, which highlights their relationship. Therefore, the government should focus on promoting the development of new information technologies and their integration with the CE system, which is crucial for the implementation of energy transition strategies. In addition, low-carbon investors should focus on these technologies because of their relationship with CE.}

abstract = {This study introduces the growing necessity of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in the context of cybersecurity, particularly in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, especially complex neural networks, become more prevalent and difficult to understand, the opacity of these models poses increasing risks in critical firald like cybersecurity. XAI aims to address these concerns by making AI models and their outputs more interpretable and transparent, thus fostering trust and secure use. Despite the rising interest and application of XAI in various domains, its integration into IDSs remains insufficient. This research provides a comprehensive overview of XAI, examining its definitions, terminologies, and the evolution of the field. It delves into the opportunities, challenges, and research needs within XAI, as well as the latest developments, tools, and technologies for implementing XAI in AI-based IDSs, alongside associated risks. The study also summarizes and demonstrates a gap in the literature regarding comprehensive reviews of IDS solutions that incorporate XAI, aiming to fill this gap by detailing the application of XAI in IDS research. The findings are expected to guide researchers, experts, users, and policymakers in the domains of AI, XAI, and IDS.}
