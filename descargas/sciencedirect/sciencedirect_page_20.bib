To overcome the scarcity of annotated dental X-ray datasets, this study presents a novel pipeline for generating high-resolution synthetic orthopantomography (OPG) images using customized generative adversarial networks (GANs).
Methods
A total of 4777 real OPG images were collected from clinical centres in Pakistan, Thailand, and the U.S., covering diverse anatomical features. Twelve GAN models were initially trained, with four top-performing variants selected for further training on both combined and region-specific datasets. Synthetic images were generated at 2048 × 1024 pixels, maintaining fine anatomical detail. The evaluation was conducted using (1) a YOLO-based object detection model trained on real OPGs to assess feature representation via mean average precision, and (2) expert dentist scoring for anatomical and diagnostic realism.
Results
All selected models produced realistic synthetic OPGs. The YOLO detector achieved strong performance on these images, indicating accurate structural representation. Expert evaluations confirmed high anatomical plausibility, with models M1 and M3 achieving over 50% of the reference scores assigned to real OPGs.
Conclusion
The developed GAN-based pipeline enables the ethical and scalable creation of synthetic OPG images, suitable for augmenting datasets used in artificial intelligence-driven dental diagnostics.
Clinical Significance
This method provides a practical solution to data limitations in dental artificial intelligence, supporting model development in privacy-sensitive or low-resource environments.}

However, the considerable complexity of the structure of the human body, brought about by continuous molecular and physiological changes, makes it extremely difficult to process medical data extracted by Artificial intelligence techniques. The latter requires a large amount of data for reliable performance, which is often difficult to obtain due to limited quality and availability. In this paper, we propose a methodology to generate Artificial medical data. In detail, we focus on generating Artificial voice signals. The analysis of voice recordings is fundamental to diagnose specific pneumo-articulatory apparatus diseases, such as dysphonia. The generative neural network employed is based on the WaveNet model, due to its autoregressive sampling, which enables generating recordings of variable length. We propose a setup which enables to generate Artificial samples of required sex and pathology to balance and augment the dataset using only one generative network. The quality of the generative network is assessed by balancing the training dataset by generated data and training a convolutional classifier, which is tested on a dataset which was not introduced to the generative network during training. We achieved reasonable improvements in classification accuracy, particularly for the under-represented sex in terms of accuracy, arguing that this approach is worthy of future research.}

abstract = {In the fabrication and monitoring of parts in composite structures, which are being used more and more in a variety of engineering applications, the prediction and fatigue failure detection in composite materials is a difficult problem. This difficulty arises from several factors, such as the lack of a comprehensive investigation of the fatigue failure phenomena, the lack of a well-defined fatigue damage theory used for fatigue damage prediction, and the inhomogeneity of composites because of their multiple internal borders. This study investigates the fatigue behavior of carbon fiber reinforced with epoxy (CFRE) laminated composite plates under spectrum loading utilizing a unique Deep Learning Network consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN). The method includes establishing Finite Element Model (FEM) in a plate model under a spectrum fatigue loading. Then, a CNN is trained for fatigue behavior prediction. The training phase produces promising results, showing the model’s performance with 94.21% accuracy, 92.63% regression, and 91.55% F-score. To evaluate the model’s reliability, a comparison is made between fatigue data from the CNN and the FEM. It was found that the error band for this comparison is less than 0.3878 MPa, affirming the accuracy and reliability of the proposed technique. The proposed method results converge with available experimental results in the literature, thus, the study suggests the broad applicability of this method to other different composite structures.}

Active phase control compensates for phase noise-induced coherence degradation by directly or indirectly detecting phase differences among sub-beams. Traditional phase control algorithms face challenges in large-scale CBC systems due to low control bandwidth. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, integrating advanced intelligent algorithms into active phase control systems holds promise for enhancing the performance of CBC systems. This paper begins with a brief introduction to the principles of traditional phase control algorithms, such as Stochastic Parallel Gradient Descent (SPGD) and locking of optical coherence by single-detector electronic-frequency tagging (LOCSET), elucidating why AI can assist in active phase control systems. Subsequently, we review recent advancements in phase control based on deep learning and reinforcement learning, concluding with a summary and future outlook. As phase control technology advances, the integration of AI and traditional algorithms will play a pivotal role in achieving high-bandwidth and accurate phase control in large-scale CBC systems.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs)—particularly GPT-4 and GPT-4o—have demonstrated high correct-answer rates in medical examinations. GPT-4o has enhanced diagnostic capabilities, advanced image processing, and updated knowledge. Japanese surgeons face critical challenges, including a declining workforce, regional health care disparities, and work-hour-related challenges. Nonetheless, although LLMs could be beneficial in surgical education, no studies have yet assessed GPT-4o’s surgical knowledge or its performance in the field of surgery.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the potential of GPT-4 and GPT-4o in surgical education by using them to take the Japan Surgical Board Examination (JSBE), which includes both textual questions and medical images—such as surgical and computed tomography scans—to comprehensively assess their surgical knowledge.
Methods
We used 297 multiple-choice questions from the 2021‐2023 JSBEs. The questions were in Japanese, and 104 of them included images. First, the GPT-4 and GPT-4o responses to only the textual questions were collected via OpenAI’s application programming interface to evaluate their correct-answer rate. Subsequently, the correct-answer rate of their responses to questions that included images was assessed by inputting both text and images.
Results
The overall correct-answer rates of GPT-4o and GPT-4 for the text-only questions were 78% (231/297) and 55% (163/297), respectively, with GPT-4o outperforming GPT-4 by 23% (P=<.01). By contrast, there was no significant improvement in the correct-answer rate for questions that included images compared with the results for the text-only questions.
Conclusions
GPT-4o outperformed GPT-4 on the JSBE. However, the results of the LLMs were lower than those of the examinees. Despite the capabilities of LLMs, image recognition remains a challenge for them, and their clinical application requires caution owing to the potential inaccuracy of their results.}

Pain associated with temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) is often confused with odontogenic pain, which is a challenge in endodontic diagnosis. Validated screening questionnaires can aid in the identification and differentiation of the source of pain. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a virtual assistant based on artificial intelligence using natural language processing techniques to automate the initial screening of patients with tooth pain.
Methods
The PAINe chatbot was developed in Python (Python Software Foundation, Beaverton, OR) language using the PyCharm (JetBrains, Prague, Czech Republic) environment and the openai library to integrate the ChatGPT 4 API (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA) and the Streamlit library (Snowflake Inc, San Francisco, CA) for interface construction. The validated TMD Pain Screener questionnaire and 1 question regarding the current pain intensity were integrated into the chatbot to perform the differential diagnosis of TMD in patients with tooth pain. The accuracy of the responses was evaluated in 50 random scenarios to compare the chatbot with the validated questionnaire. The kappa coefficient was calculated to assess the agreement level between the chatbot responses and the validated questionnaire.
Results
The chatbot achieved an accuracy rate of 86% and a substantial level of agreement (κ = 0.70). Most responses were clear and provided adequate information about the diagnosis.
Conclusions
The implementation of a virtual assistant using natural language processing based on large language models for initial differential diagnosis screening of patients with tooth pain demonstrated substantial agreement between validated questionnaires and the chatbot.

During the last decade, AI has made major technological breakthroughs most recently in the space of generative AI. This development is enabled by an increase in computing power, a decrease in its price, and the emergence of ubiquitous computing, resulting in vast amounts of storable and processable data. However, the diffusion of AI depends on its legitimacy in society, whereby legitimacy is understood as the congruence between organizational activities and their cultural environment. This study aims at understanding the process whereby AI is being (de)legitimated across key industries and over time. To capture and trace the process of legitimation, we rely on media coverage as a form of societal discourse reflecting the legitimation process of AI. We find that the legitimation process gathers momentum in the mid-2010s and the legitimacy of AI increases over time. Furthermore, we identify four types of legitimacy discourse, which integrate sentiment, specific media frames, and appeals of persuasion. Uncovering the four types of legitimacy discourse, we aim at supporting organizations seeking to understand the legitimacy of specific AI applications and how these legitimacy judgments can shift.}

Artificial Intelligence AI is increasingly becoming a foundation of competitive planning for contemporary organizations. However, even though the implementation of AI in organizations is a critical intervention that can unlock new forms of value, many of these implementations do not meet the expected outcomes. They may result in substantial financial, operational, and reputational negative consequences. This systematic literature review starts with a sample of 3104 articles from well-reputed journals published between 2010-2024. It aims to examine several questions that surround the occurrence of AI failure in organizations: the reasons behind those failures, the categories of the failures, and the disciplinary areas of the failures. Moreover, customers', employees', and management's points of view are considered in the review to extrapolate the potential consequences of the failure of AI systems. The result demonstrates that the AI breakdown often results from a mixture of technology, organization, and people problems and that different industries exhibit diverce types of failures.}

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a proof of concept for a transformational emissions ledger system that integrates an AI-powered large multimodal model for automatic parsing of emission-relevant data and a blockchain-enabled smart contract for a traceable and immutable emissions ledger. The proposed solution enables project stakeholders to automatically generate an immutable emissions ledger recorded on blockchain during the material transportation and on-site assembly phases, thereby enhancing their ability to make informed decisions regarding carbon emissions management. Additionally, this system enables regulatory approaches, including subsidies and tax incentives, all anchored in an immutable emissions ledger based on blockchain.}

However, the varying distribution of X-ray image data across different hospitals has resulted in a decline in the model’s performance when transitioning to a new dataset. Domain adaptation techniques can effectively mitigate the impact of this issue. However, current domain adaptation methods align the entire image features between the source and target domains without explicitly focusing on regions containing transferable classification information across domains. Forced alignment of features across the entire image may lead to negative transfer. This paper proposes a complementary domain attention model (CDAM) for TB detection where the feature map is partitioned into domain-shared (DSH) and domain-specific (DSP) features. DSP features are complementary to DSH features. DSH features are responsible for mitigating the impact of domain gaps on classification. Consequently, they focus on areas containing classification information that can be transferred across domains. In contrast, the role of the DSP feature is to maximize the domain gap, concentrating its attention on areas rich in domain information. Given that the DSH and DSP features are complementary, when the DSP feature occupies domain-informative areas, it simultaneously encourages the DSH feature to focus more accurately on areas containing transferable classification information across domains, thereby enhancing classification performance. The objective of CDAM is to fully consider the importance of different regions within the feature map and mitigate negative transfer. The proposed method underwent domain adaptation experiments on the Shenzhen, Montgomery, and TBX11K datasets, achieving average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity scores of 73.3%, 74.0%, and 72.7%, respectively. This result surpasses existing domain adaptation methods for TB data, providing evidence for the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.}

The presentation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the educational domain has turned conventional learning settings into advanced tools that maximize the performance of students. Engagement is a crucial determinant of students' success in AI-driven settings. However, identifying how psychological variables like self-efficacy and grit influence engagement in such settings is an emerging area in education. Directed by Self-determination theory (SDT), the present research aims to examine the interaction between students' grit, self-efficacy, and engagement.
Methods
The data were collected from 382 students in three Chinese universities with a range of academic majors. The three questionnaires were administered, and following data collection, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to determine the model, and multiple regression analyses tested the predictive power of self-efficacy and grit on learners' engagement.
Results
Grit positively predicts engagement, suggesting that learners with higher levels of perseverance and consistency are more likely to believe in their capabilities and actively participate in learning activities. In turn, self-efficacy has a direct effect on engagement, implying that confidence in one's abilities contributes meaningfully to students' engagement in academic tasks.
Conclusion
The finding suggests that these two psychological constructs play a substantial and statistically significant role in shaping how actively and meaningfully students participate in AI-driven settings. Practical recommendations are aimed at enhancing learners' self-efficacy and grit, thus boosting engagement. These results contribute to a broader picture of SDT's application in AI-driven settings, offering ground for further research into motivational processes in such learning.}

abstract = {Objective
Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to become increasingly integrated with clinical medicine. Generative AI, and particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, have shown promise in generating human-like text, providing a potential tool for augmenting clinical care. These online AI chatbots have already demonstrated remarkable clinical potential, having passed the US Medical Licensing Exam, for example. The evaluation of these LLMs in the surgical literature, especially as it applies to judgement and decision-making, is sparse. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the efficacy of ChatGPT-4 in providing clinician-level vascular surgery recommendations and (2) compare its performance with its predecessor, ChatGPT-3.5, to gauge the progression of clinical competencies of LLMs.
Methods
A set of 40 clinician-level questions spanning 4 domains of vascular surgery (carotid artery disease, visceral artery aneurysms, abdominal aortic aneurysms, chronic limb-threatening ischemia) were generated by clinical experts. These domains were chosen based on the availability of updated guidelines published before September 2021, which served as the cutoff date for the training dataset of the LLMs. The questions, devoid of additional context or prompts, were input into ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 between March 20 and March 25, 2023. Responses were independently evaluated by two blinded reviewers using a 5-point Likert scale assessing comprehensiveness, accuracy, and consistency with guidelines. The Flesch-Kincaid grade level of each response was also determined. Independent samples t test and Fisher's exact test were used for comparative analysis.
Results
ChatGPT-4 significantly outperformed ChatGPT-3.5 by providing appropriate recommendations in 38 of 40 questions (95%) as compared with 13 of 40 (32.5%) by ChatGPT-3.5 (Fisher's exact test P < .001). Despite longer response lengths (chatGPT-4 mean 317 ± 58 words vs chatGPT-3.5 mean 265 ± 74 words; P < .001), the reading ease of both models remained similar, corresponding with college-level graduate texts.
Conclusions
ChatGPT-4 can consistently respond accurately to complex clinician-level vascular surgery questions. This also represents a substantial advancement in performance compared with its predecessor, which was released only a few months prior, highlighting the progress of performance of LLMs in clinical medicine. Several limitations persist with the use of LLMs, including hallucinations, data privacy issues, and the black box problem, However, these findings suggest that, with further refinements, LLMs like ChatGPT-4 have the potential to become indispensable tools in clinical decision-making, thereby marking an exciting frontier in the fusion of AI with clinical medicine and vascular surgery.}

AI-driven DR classification frameworks typically consist of sequential stages: image preprocessing, optic disc (OD) localization and removal, blood vessel segmentation, feature extraction, and classification of DR severity. In the proposed and implemented model, each of these phases was systematically addressed to ensure improved performance. The implementation demonstrated superior accuracy, achieving 98.02 % on the widely used MESSIDOR dataset. The pipeline incorporated effective preprocessing to enhance image quality, accurate OD localization and exclusion to avoid false detections, followed by precise vessel segmentation. Extracted features were then used to train deep learning models for DR severity classification. Comparative analysis with existing methods executed on the same dataset revealed that proposed model outperformed other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. Ww outline the recent progress in AI-based DR screening, highlighting the significance of each diagnostic phase and their role in improving overall performance.

abstract = {Introduction
This study evaluates the performance of ChatGPT, particularly its versions 4 and 4o, in answering questions from the French orthopedic and trauma surgery exam (Diplôme d’Études Spécialisées, DES), compared to the results of French orthopedic surgery residents. Previous research has examined ChatGPT's capabilities across various medical specialties and exams, with mixed results, especially in the interpretation of complex radiological images.
Hypothesis
ChatGPT version 4o was capable of achieving a score equal to or higher (not lower) than that of residents for the DES exam.
Methods
The response capabilities of the ChatGPT model, versions 4 and 4o, were evaluated and compared to the results of residents for 250 questions taken from the DES exams from 2020 to 2024. A secondary analysis focused on the differences in the AI's performance based on the type of data being analyzed (text or images) and the topic of the questions.
Results
The score achieved by ChatGPT-4o was equivalent to that of residents over the past five years: 74.8% for ChatGPT-4o vs. 70.8% for residents (p = 0.32). The accuracy rate of ChatGPT was significantly higher in its latest version 4o compared to version 4 (58.8%, p = 0.0001). Secondary subgroup analysis revealed a performance deficiency of the AI in analyzing graphical images (success rates of 48% and 65% for ChatGPT-4 and 4o, respectively). ChatGPT-4o showed superior performance to version 4 when the topics involved the spine, pediatrics, and lower limb.
Conclusion
The performance of ChatGPT-4o is equivalent to that of French students in answering questions from the DES in orthopedic and trauma surgery. Significant progress has been observed between versions 4 and 4o. The analysis of questions involving iconography remains a notable challenge for the current versions of ChatGPT, with a tendency for the AI to perform less effectively compared to questions requiring only text analysis.

Teacher educators, as key facilitators of pre-service teacher learning, play a critical role in shaping the successful adoption of GenAI. Their perceptions guide curriculum redesign, define promoted practices, and shape how pre-service teachers experience educational uses of GenAI tools, potentially multiplying its impact across future classrooms. This mixed-methods study explored Danish teacher educators’ perceptions of GenAI (n = 91), focusing on its transformative potential and the knowledge pre-service teachers need to acquire. Innovative methods, including GenAI-supported thematic analysis and Natural Language Processing, were used to analyze qualitative and quantitative survey data. Findings reveal diverse perceptions, ranging from enthusiasm for fostering innovative teaching to concerns about ethics, assessment, and safeguarding basic skills. Concerning GenAI’s potential, three key themes emerged: AI literacy, AI didactics, and AI assessment. Regarding required knowledge, teacher educators emphasized multifaceted AI literacies (AI as a teaching tool, as teaching content, and as a learning tool) framed within ethical, cultural, and democratic contexts. Mediation analyses showed that GenAI use mediated the link between both intrinsic motivation and confidence, and perceptions of its potential. Importantly, teacher educators identified a pressing need for both formal professional development and informal, collaborative learning opportunities. This study extends the TPACK framework by incorporating the triadic nature of AI literacy and emphasizes the importance of preparing educators to engage critically and responsibly with GenAI in education.}

abstract = {Purpose
While the literature on artificial intelligence (AI) capability is expanding, gaps remain in understanding how this capability is internally developed in technology-based startups (TBS) across different life cycle phases. This study, grounded in the resource orchestration theory (ROT), investigates the pathway through which TBS use organizational creativity to build AI capability and achieve performance.
Design/methodology/approach
A conceptual framework based on ROT emphasizes the role of organizational creativity in the structuring and bundling processes. Data were collected through a survey of 166 managers and employees of TBS operating in Brazil and international markets, using multiple linear regressions and the Sobel test for analysis. The study validated the AI capability scale in the TBS context.
Findings
AI capability fully mediates the relationship between organizational creativity and performance, confirming that organizational creativity is a critical resource for AI capability development. These findings advance ROT by deepening the understanding of how AI capability is developed in TBS. The study offers a dynamic, process-based view of performance trajectories in TBS, demonstrating that the synchrony between creativity and AI capability creates a cyclical process, maximizing company performance.
Originality/value
This research identifies an alternative pathway for TBS to develop AI capability and achieve performance, highlighting the synchronization and co-evolution of resources and capabilities. It provides novel insights into AI capability’s mediating role and expands understanding of resource management in TBS across life cycle phases.}

abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common and second most deadly cancer worldwide. Despite advances in screening and treatment, CRC is heterogeneous and the response to therapy varies significantly, limiting personalized treatment options. Certain molecular biomarkers, including microsatellite instability (MSI), are critical in planning personalized treatment, although only a subset of patients may benefit. Currently, the primary methods for assessing MSI status include immunohistochemistry (IHC) for DNA mismatch repair proteins (MMRs), polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular testing, or next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, these techniques have limitations, are expensive and time-consuming, and often result in inter-method inconsistencies. Deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) or high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) are critical predictive biomarkers of response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy and MSI testing is recommended to identify patients who may benefit. There is a pressing need for a more robust, reliable, and cost-effective approach that accurately assesses MSI status. Recent advances in computational pathology, in particular the development of technologies that digitally scan whole slide images (WSI) at high resolution, as well as new approaches to artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine, are increasingly gaining ground. This review aims to provide an overview of the latest findings on WSI and advances in AI methods for predicting MSI status, summarize their applications in CRC, and discuss their strengths and limitations in daily clinical practice.}

Prior research on hospitality communication has not solved this issue, as AI-generated images are occasionally promoted as effective marketing tools across various service contexts, while other scholars caution against their use due to the significant concerns they may trigger among consumers. Following a mixed-methods approach to find boundary conditions, our research reveals that consumers prefer hospitality services advertised with real images, rather than those featuring AI-generated images. Nevertheless, this effect is moderated by two key factors. In particular, the research reveals that the negative influence of using generative AI images on intentions to use and recommend the service are strengthened for hedonic rather than utilitarian services, and for highly rather than lowly involved customers. A qualitative study further explores the reasons behind this rejection, highlighting that customers perceive companies using AI-generated images as impersonal, less professional, lacking credibility, and potentially misleading, as they impede customers’ ability to envision the actual experience. Implications for management suggest that, while generative AI holds promise for enhancing communication, companies should use AI-generated images with caution. The discussion also proposes future research directions to explore the broader implications of AI use in marketing.}

This paper presents a paradigmatic framework for addressing these issues in water management scenarios by integrating advanced physical modelling, remote sensing techniques, and Artificial Intelligence algorithms. The proposed approach accurately predicts water availability, estimates demand, and optimizes resource allocation on both short- and long-term basis, combining a comprehensive hydrological model, agronomic crop models for precise demand estimation, and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming for efficient resource distribution. In the study case of the Segura Hydrographic Basin, the approach successfully allocated approximately 642 million cubic meters (hm3) of water over six months, minimizing the deficit to 9.7% of the total estimated demand. The methodology demonstrated significant environmental benefits, reducing CO2 emissions while optimizing resource distribution. This robust solution supports informed decision-making processes, ensuring sustainable water management across diverse contexts. The generalizability of this approach allows its adaptation to other basins, contributing to improved governance and policy implementation on a broader scale. Ultimately, the methodology has been validated and integrated into the operational water management practices in the Segura Hydrographic Basin in Spain.}

This research aims to analyse scientific information related to the integration of AI in studies on hydrogeology and ecological restoration of watersheds by analysing scientific databases for knowledge of the intellectual structure, lines and trends of research. The methodology includes three phases: i) search criteria and data processing (Scopus-Web of Science); ii) analysis of the intellectual and conceptual structure; and iii) application of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. The results indicate that there is a total of 171 records, with a 4.49% growth in scientific production in the last four years, focusing on artificial neural networks (10.53%), artificial intelligence (3.51%), genetic algorithms (1.17%) and machine learning (1.17%). This increase is due to the climatic variation generated in recent years, driven by anthropogenic pressures, especially in the agricultural sector due to the high demand for fertiliser and pesticide pollution. This problem has prompted the search for more far-reaching environmental management technologies, making it a potential niche for study. China (72.51%) and the United States (25.73%) are the most outstanding contributors to production in this area. On the other hand, there is less research in this area in developing countries such as South Africa (2.92%), Colombia (1.17%), and Argentina (0.58%), among others. This analysis identifies opportunities and challenges in applying AI for water resource optimisation and water quality prediction, providing an innovative conceptual framework for sustainable watershed management.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into healthcare education and research, yet little is known about how AI is perceived within osteopathy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cross-sectional study to examine AI perspectives specifically among osteopathic educators and researchers, providing fresh insights into technology adoption within this healthcare discipline.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted between December 2023 and February 2024 among osteopathic educators and/or researchers through snowball sampling. The survey collected data on AI-related knowledge, usage in educational and research contexts, attitudes toward AI, perceived risks, and necessities challenges. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to validate the structure of the survey. Demographic factors such as age, gender, occupation, and academic qualifications were analysed in relation to scores.
Results
190 respondents from 18 countries completed the survey. Participants demonstrated positive attitudes toward the role of AI in education and research, but acknowledged limited proficiency in its use. Usage of AI was higher among younger, male participants, with AI primarily used for personal organisation and research. Concerns about AI included risks of bias, over-reliance on technology, and potential replacement of human judgment. Participants with educational roles expressed fewer concerns about AI's risks compared to those outside of education. Knowledge of AI was not correlated with demographic factors, but attitudes and concerns about risks varied with age.
Conclusion
Osteopathic educators and researchers view AI as a beneficial tool for teaching and research, but face challenges in its effective implementation due to concerns about technology replacing human expertise and biases. Training, institutional support, and ethical guidelines are essential to foster the responsible integration of AI in osteopathy.
Implications for practice
●AI is underutilised in osteopathic education and research despite positive attitudes towards its potential.●Educators are less concerned about AI risks, positioning them as key facilitators of responsible assimilation.●Institutional policies should provide clear AI usage guidelines while addressing ethical and validity concerns.●AI should support, not replace, human expertise, ensuring critical thinking remains central in education and research.}

In fact, it promises to master and coordinate the immense pool of information acquired so far about chemical reactions (about 100 million data), so that optimization of process parameters and prediction of process performance will be by far more effective than they are today. In other words, problems, which ordinarily require years of work by highly qualified chemical engineers could be solved in minutes. How to synthesize a given chemical compound from available reagents; what will happen as a result of the reaction mixing given chemical compounds under specific conditions; under what conditions a given reaction should be carried out; how to design a chemical reactor; what the reactor conditions are and how to optimize it to achieve the best economics? This issue concerns AI—a combination of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). ML uses algorithms to analyze data, learn from it, and make informed decisions based on gained knowledge. Instead, DL creates an “artificial neural network” that can independently learn and make intelligent decisions. In addition, the development of AI technologies has led to the creation of robotic chemists (RS), which can synthesize compounds of interest on their own. In this case, the AI serves as the cognitive brain, and the robot acts as a physical body, providing autonomous operation.}

Although there has been an increasing body of empirical research on the topic, it has generally yielded conflicting findings. This study contributes to the ongoing debate by examining the linear and nonlinear effects of AI on the unemployment of people with disability in 40 countries between 2007 and 2021. Using the system Generalized Methods of Moments and panel smooth transition regression, the main conclusions are as follows. First, AI reduces the unemployment of people with disability in the full sample. Second, upon disaggregating the sample based on income level (high income/non-high income) and gender (men/women), the linear model only detects an inverse correlation between AI and unemployment among people with disability in high-income countries and among men, whereas it does not influence unemployment in non-high-income countries and women. Third, the panel smooth transition regression model suggests that the effects of AI on the unemployment of people with disability and among women are only observed once artificial intelligence interest search exceeds a specific threshold level. The effects of AI in non-high-income economies and among women are not significant in the lower regime, which confirms the nonlinear association between AI and the unemployment rate of people with disability. These findings have important policy implications for facilitating the integration of people with disability into the labor market.}

The research uses the TVP-SV-VAR methodology to recognise the ever-changing correlation among the artificial intelligence index (AII), global supply chain pressure indicator (GSCPI) and global energy-related uncertainty index (GEUI). In light of quantitative discussions, it is presented that AII exerts negative influences on GSCPI and GEUI, highlighting that the development of artificial intelligence would facilitate global supply chain stability and energy sustainability; in turn, GSCPI and GEUI have positive and adverse influences on AII. Through comparing, the correlation between AII and GEUI is only reflected in the short term, whereas the interrelationship between AII and GSCPI could be observed in the short-, medium- and long-run situations. In addition, GSCPI exerts positive and negative influences on GEUI in the short, medium and long runs, whereas the positive effects of GEUI on GSCPI means the uncertainty in the energy market might destroy the supply chain across the globe. In the context of a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, this study will provide significant recommendations to maintain global supply chain stability and energy sustainability by applying artificial intelligence technology.}

However, despite many successful applications, machine learning continues to suffer from performance and transparency issues. These challenges can be partially attributed to the limited use of domain knowledge by machine learning models. This research proposes using the domain knowledge represented in conceptual models to improve the preparation of the data used to train machine learning models. We develop and demonstrate a method, called the Conceptual Modeling for Machine Learning (CMML), which is comprised of guidelines for data preparation in machine learning and based on conceptual modeling constructs and principles. To assess the impact of CMML on machine learning outcomes, we first applied it to two real-world problems to evaluate its impact on model performance. We then solicited an assessment by data scientists on the applicability of the method. These results demonstrate the value of CMML for improving machine learning outcomes.}

Numerous research efforts are currently focused on detecting pelvic fractures using advanced intelligent processes. Although these methods have shown impressive accuracy, they frequently result in extended processing times. To address this challenge, we propose a model that integrates three key components of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to enhance the speed of fracture detection. The first component is an explainable segment that pinpoints the location of fractures. The second component is a deep generative approach that carefully analyzes images to simplify feature complexity. The final component is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which assists in decision-making by introducing four transfer learning models: InceptionV2, Xception, MobileNet, and MobileNetV2. Among these, the MobileNet-based approach demonstrates the highest accuracy in classifying conditions, achieving an accuracy of 93.43%, a precision of 99.47%, a sensitivity of 99.38%, and an F1 score of 99.42%, based on a dataset of 876 images. These results are surprising, as the model consistently performed exceptionally well in detecting pelvic fractures. This finding is significant because the model consistently showcased superior performance in identifying pelvic fractures. Moreover, the overall performance of the proposed XAI is comparable to that of medical professionals and orthopedic specialists in detecting pelvic fractures. The proposed technique may offer a promising solution to the challenges in pelvic fracture identification. It harnesses the strengths of deep generative models and CNNs to deliver accurate and interpretable results.}

This study investigates customers’ perceptions and adoption intentions regarding personalized solutions provided by AI or humans. Drawing from stereotyping theory, mind perception theory, and uniqueness theory, this study establishes a serial mediation model, with provider type (AI versus human) as the independent variable, expected group size and perceived uniqueness of solutions as serial mediators, and perceived similarity to others as a moderator. Customer attitude and adoption intention serve as the dependent variables. Based on two online scenario experiments, we collected 533 valid responses from participants in China (N = 262) and the United States (N = 271). The results indicate that customers tend to perceive AI-generated solutions as less unique, compared to those provided by humans, and consequently exhibit less favorable attitudes and lower adoption intentions. Furthermore, the expected large group size associated with AI-generated solutions serves as an underlying psychological mechanism that negatively affects customers’ perception of uniqueness. Especially when customers perceive themselves as dissimilar to typical users of AI, they are more likely to infer that AI cannot autonomously deliver personalized solutions, and therefore may share their information with others, resulting in a larger expected group size. These findings contribute to the literature on AI-generated content, uniqueness perception, and information adoption, while also offering practical implications for businesses seeking to more effectively leverage AI tools in delivering personalized solutions.}

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers a powerful avenue for peptide design, yet this process remains challenging due to vast sequence space, complex structure-activity relationships, and the need to balance antimicrobial potency with low toxicity. Here, we introduce AMP-Diffusion, a latent diffusion model fine-tuned on antimicrobial peptide (AMP) sequences using embeddings from protein language models (pLMs). AMP-Diffusion enables the rapid discovery of antibiotic candidates by systematically exploring sequence space. We generated 50,000 candidate sequences, filtered and ranked them using our APEX deep learning (DL) model, and synthesized 46 top candidates. These peptides showed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, including against multidrug-resistant strains, while exhibiting low cytotoxicity. Mechanistic studies revealed membrane permeabilization and depolarization as primary modes of action. In a preclinical mouse model, lead peptides reduced bacterial loads with efficacy comparable to polymyxin B and levofloxacin, with no detectable adverse effects. AMP-Diffusion thus presents a robust platform for designing antibiotics.}

Over the past decades, the integration of modern technologies — such as electronic health records, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) — has revolutionized the collection, storage, and analysis of medical data in neurology. In epilepsy, Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs) are the most established biomarker, indicating an increased likelihood of seizures. Their detection traditionally relies on visual EEG assessment, a time-consuming and subjective process contributing to a high misdiagnosis rate. These limitations have spurred the development of automated AI-driven approaches aimed at improving accuracy and efficiency in IED detection.
Methods
Research on automated IED detection began 45 years ago, spanning from morphological methods to deep learning techniques. In this review, we examine various IED detection approaches, evaluating their performance and limitations.
Results
Traditional machine learning and deep learning methods have produced the most promising results to date, and their application in IED detection continues to grow. Today, AI-driven tools are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows, assisting clinicians in identifying abnormalities while reducing false-positive rates.
Discussion
To optimize the clinical implementation of automated AI-based IED detection, it is essential to render the codes publicly available and to standardize the datasets and metrics. Establishing uniform benchmarks will enable objective model comparisons and help determine which approaches are best suited for clinical use.}

Specimen Mammography (SM) is commonly used in Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS) for intraoperative margin analysis. A systematic scoping review was conducted to identify sources of methodological variation in Specimen Mammography Interpretation (SMI) and assess the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to optimise Diagnostic Accuracy (DA).
Methods
Embase, Pubmed, Cochrane and web of science databases were searched. Studies were included if SM was used for margin analysis for BCS with reported DA compared with pathological margin status and data extracted.
Results
1242 unique studies were identified, of which 40 were included. 39/40 studies did not utilise AI for SMI, with 4 studies comparing 2 relevant techniques, giving 43 non-AI study arms for analysis. There was wide variation in SM techniques, including number of views and location of SM. Specialist performing SMI in usual clinical practice was surgeon (13/39 studies;33 %), radiologist(s) (16/39;41 %), surgeon and radiologist (3/39;8 %) or not stated (7/39;18 %) which differed from the study specialist in 15/39 (38 %) of studies. Diagnostic accuracy in studies ranged from sensitivity 19–91.7 % and specificity 25–100 %.
Conclusions
There is marked variation in current techniques used for SM for intraoperative margin analysis with correspondingly disparate DA. Only 1 study applied AI to SMI, and we identify how AI could optimise SMI and a template for future work to apply AI techniques to SMI, reduce unwarranted variation and optimise DA.}

As leaders of the ACR Commissions on Quality and Safety and Informatics, we are dedicated to establishing ACR accreditation for radiology AI. In this article, we outline our plan for this effort. ACR accreditation is a peer-reviewed process that evaluates radiology practices according to ACR Practice Parameters and Technical Standards, which are consensus-based guidelines aimed at improving care quality and reducing variability. ACR Practice Parameters focus on clinical aspects like patient management, and Technical Standards address the performance of imaging and treatment equipment. To support the development of this accreditation program, the ACR Recognized Center for Healthcare-AI (ARCH-AI) program has been established as a precursor to formal accreditation. ARCH-AI participants attest to meeting minimum criteria in areas such as governance, model selection, acceptance testing, monitoring, and management of locally developed models. Insights gained from ARCH-AI will inform the development of the formal accreditation program, which will culminate in ACR Council approval, currently anticipated in spring 2027. The College remains committed to fostering dialogue among members and stakeholders to ensure AI fulfills its promise of enhancing patient care safely and effectively.}

abstract = {Summary
Objective
To evaluate and compare the performance of OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 and Microsoft Copilot in providing information on 3D-printed orthodontic appliances, with a focus on the accuracy, completeness of the content, and response generation time.
Methods
This cross-sectional study proceeded in five stages. Initially, three orthodontists created a total of 125 questions concerning 3D printed orthodontic appliances of which 105 questions were finalized to be incorporated into the study by a panel of senior orthodontists. These questions were subsequently organized into 15 distinct domains. Both chatbots were presented with the questions under consistent conditions, using the same laptop and internet setup. A stopwatch was used to record response times. The responses were anonymized and evaluated by seven orthodontists with extensive experience, who scored accuracy and completeness based on standardized tools. Through discussion, evaluators reached a consensus on each score, ensuring reliability.
Results
Spearman's correlation revealed a moderate to strong negative correlation between accuracy and completeness for both chatbots (p≤0.001). The negative correlation observed between accuracy and completeness scores, particularly prominent in Copilot, indicates a trade-off between these qualities in some responses. Mann-Whitney U tests confirmed significant differences in accuracy and completeness between the chatbots (p≤0.001), though response time differences were not statistically significant (p=0.204). Cohen's Kappa results implied little to no consistency between the two models on the assessed parameters (p>0.05).
Conclusion
ChatGPT-4 outperformed Microsoft Copilot in accuracy and completeness, providing more precise and comprehensive information on 3D-printed orthodontic appliances demonstrating a greater ability to handle complex, and detailed requests in this area.}

However, AI-driven approaches rely solely on the appropriate management of these technologies. AI is there to predict and narrow down the parameters. They must be validated through clinical trials for complete reliability. As genome sequencing becomes more readily available, and as AI-driven panomics matures, the promise of personalized medicine tailored to individual genetic profiles is becoming a reality. However, these technologies should augment rather than replace, the expertise of clinicians, ensuring that AI serves as a powerful tool in the hands of healthcare professionals.}

A path analysis (PA) for hypothesized relationships suggested PEU and SN are significant predictors of BI and UB, whereas PU's influence on BI was indirect. Significantly, EU concerns negatively moderated the relationship between BI and UB, suggesting that higher ethical concerns can reduce ChatGPT usage. Cross-cultural analysis uncovered significant differences in perceptions and usage patterns influenced by institutional policies, academic levels, and demographic factors. Our findings affirm TAM's robustness in predicting technology use across various cultural and institutional settings. Findings also underscore the crucial roles of social influence in fostering positive user behaviors for Chat GPT.

To address the challenges of high computational resource demands and limited adaptability of traditional prediction models to complex conditions, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence-enabled predictive energy saving planning based on the Transformer-GRU model for predicting coolant temperature in the liquid cooling system of data centers. By integrating the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer and the time-series prediction strengths of GRU, the model performs correlation analysis and feature extraction of key parameters to achieve high-precision predictions of coolant return temperature. Experimental results demonstrate the model’s superior accuracy compared to traditional prediction models, achieving an MSE of 1.349, RMSE of 1.157, MAPE of 0.0244, and R2 of 81.07 %, significantly outperforming baseline models such as Transformer-LSTM (MSE = 1.355), Informer (MSE = 1.356), Reformer (MSE = 1.353), DeepAR (MSE = 1.385), LSTM (MSE = 1.351), GRU (MSE = 1.366), and CNN-GRU (MSE = 1.363). The model maintains high predictive accuracy under fluctuating environments and complex cooling conditions, effectively reducing the operational energy consumption of the liquid cooling system. This advancement not only enhances cooling efficiency but also drives data centers toward greater intelligence and sustainability. By leveraging real-time monitoring data and predictive control, the model dynamically optimizes cooling strategies, reducing coolant and energy usage while promoting sustainable resource utilization. Additionally, this study offers implementation insights for high-performance computing environments, laying the groundwork for future research on extending model capabilities and integrating multimodal data.}

abstract = {Background
The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) use in higher education has generated substantial debate among academics and students, given the potential for students to engage in academic misconduct through the misuse of AI. Academics argue that AI poses a serious threat to the foundational development of nurses through the questionable integrity of AI-generated academic work and by undermining the development of critical thinking skills essential for professional practice. However, there is limited research on nursing students' integration of AI technologies in their studies.
Method
This study utilised a convergent parallel mixed methods approach to develop a multiphase approach with convergent parallel techniques for the qualitative and quantitative phases. The quantitative method utilised a Qualtrics-powered online survey to engage 188 nursing students, exploring various domains related to AI use. In the qualitative phase, in-depth interviews with 13 purposively sampled students provided deeper insights. The qualitative data were analysed using an inductive thematic analysis approach, while the quantitative data were analysed using SPSS.
Result
In the survey, 24 % of respondents reported using AI, ranging from moderate to extensive usage. In logistics regression analysis, hearing about AI (OR = 3.9; CI 1.07–10.2; p < 0.05), the belief that AI was useful in the studies (OR = 5.5; CI 1.7–17.3; p < 0.01), and the perception that learning to use AI is easy (OR = 3.4; CI 1.1–11.1; p < 0.05) predicted AI use. Qualitative findings revealed that all students used AI for various academic purposes. The ‘fascinating’, ‘intelligent’ and ‘efficient’ nature of AI in handling ‘time-consuming’ academic tasks motivated its use. However, concerns about breaching academic integrity and the value of achieving success through personal effort served as deterrents.
Conclusion
The findings suggest that while AI's efficiency drives students to adopt it, they remain cautious about its ethical implications, leading to uncertainty in its application within academic practices. This highlights the critical need for institutional support and explicit guidelines on responsible AI integration in educational settings.}

However, with the rapid evolution of consumer demands, traditional aesthetic design processes for personalized products face significant challenges. The core challenge lies in effectively integrating Generative AI, individual differences, and style-based user preference modeling into the personalized product design workflow. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel approach that integrates style-themed information into the generation and evaluation of personalized product aesthetics and a new dataset. In the personalized aesthetic generation phase, a predictive model is developed to infer consumer style preferences. The top-ranked styles are then used as conditional inputs to guide the generation of conceptual design solutions. In the personalized aesthetic evaluation phase, a personalized aesthetic evaluation incorporating style themes is conducted using a hybrid model that combines interaction matrix with collaborative filtering. The proposed method is empirically validated through a case study involving wristwatch design. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both aesthetic design generation and aesthetic personalized evaluation. It proves especially effective in enhancing design efficiency and meeting personalized product aesthetic preferences.}

abstract = {Introduction
Medical reports contain critical information and require concise language, yet often display errors despite advances in digital tools. This study compared the effectiveness of ChatGPT 4.0 in reporting orthographic, grammatical, and content errors in German neurology reports to a human expert.
Materials and Methods
Ten neurology reports were embedded with ten linguistic errors each, including typographical and grammatical mistakes, and one significant content error. The reports were reviewed by ChatGPT 4.0 using three prompts: (1) check the text for spelling and grammatical errors and report them in a list format without altering the original text, (2) identify spelling and grammatical errors and generate a revised version of the text, ensuring content integrity, (3) evaluate the text for factual inaccuracies, including incorrect information and treatment errors, and report them without modifying the original text. Human control was provided by an experienced medical secretary. Outcome parameters were processing time, percentage of identified errors, and overall error detection rate.
Results
Artificial intelligence (AI) accuracy in error detection was 35% (median) for Prompt 1 and 75% for Prompt 2. The mean word count of erroneous medical reports was 980 (SD = 180). AI-driven report generation was significantly faster than human review (AI Prompt 1: 102.4 s; AI Prompt 2: 209.4 s; Human: 374.0 s; p < 0.0001). Prompt 1, a tabular error report, was faster but less accurate than Prompt 2, a revised version of the report (p = 0.0013). Content analysis by Prompt 3 identified 70% of errors in 34.6 seconds.
Conclusions
AI-driven text processing for medical reports is feasible and effective. ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated strong performance in detecting and reporting errors. The effectiveness of AI depends on prompt design, significantly impacting quality and duration. Integration into medical workflows could enhance accuracy and efficiency. AI holds promise in improving medical report writing. However, proper prompt design seems to be crucial. Appropriately integrated AI can significantly enhance supervision and quality control in health care documentation.
Zusammenfassung
Einleitung
Arztbriefe enthalten wichtige Informationen und erfordern eine präzise Sprache. Sie weisen jedoch trotz Fortschritten in der modernen Textbearbeitung häufig Fehler auf. Unsere Studie vergleicht die Effektivität von ChatGPT 4.0 bezüglich der Identifikation und Korrektur orthografischer, grammatikalischer und inhaltlicher Fehler in deutschen neurologischen Arztbriefen mit dem Korrekturlesen durch eine medizinisch versierte Fachkraft.
Material und Methoden
Zehn neurologische Musterarztbriefe wurden jeweils mit zehn sprachlichen Fehlern, darunter orthografische und grammatikalische Fehler, sowie einem schwerwiegenden inhaltlichen Fehler versehen. Die Überprüfung durch ChatGPT 4.0 erfolgte anhand dreier unterschiedlicher Eingabeaufforderungen (Prompts): (1) Identifikation von Rechtschreib- und Grammatikfehlern mit tabellarischer Auflistung der Fehler, ohne den Originaltext zu verändern, (2) Erkennung von Rechtschreib- und Grammatikfehlern mit anschließender Erstellung einer überarbeiteten Textversion unter Wahrung der inhaltlichen Integrität, (3) Überprüfung des Textes auf inhaltliche Ungenauigkeiten, einschließlich fehlerhafter Informationen und Behandlungsfehler, mit Fehlerbericht ohne entsprechende Textmodifikation. Als Kontrolle diente eine erfahrene medizinische Schreibkraft. Die Evaluationsparameter umfassten die Bearbeitungszeit, den prozentualen Anteil erkannter Fehler sowie die Gesamtfehlererkennungsrate.
Ergebnisse
Die Fehlererkennungsgenauigkeit der künstlichen Intelligenz (KI) betrug für Prompt 1 im Median 35% und für Prompt 2 im Median 75%. Die durchschnittliche Länge der fehlerhaften Arztbriefe lag bei 980 Wörtern (SD = 180). Die KI-basierte Fehleranalyse erfolgte signifikant schneller als die menschliche Korrektur (KI Prompt 1: 102,4 s; KI Prompt 2: 209,4 s; Mensch: 374,0 s; p < 0,0001). Während Prompt 1 als tabellarischer Fehlerbericht schneller, jedoch weniger präzise war, erwies sich Prompt 2 mit einer überarbeiteten Textversion als genauer (p = 0,0013). Die inhaltliche Analyse durch Prompt 3 identifizierte 70% der Fehlinformationen in 34,6 s.
Schlussfolgerungen
Die KI-gestützte Textüberprüfung für Arztbriefe ist schon jetzt praktikabel und effektiv. ChatGPT 4.0 zeigte gute Leistungen mit einer schnellen Fehlererkennung und Fehlerberichterstattung. Die Effektivität der KI hängt maßgeblich vom Prompt-Design ab, das Qualität und Bearbeitungsdauer signifikant beeinflusst. Eine Integration solcher Tools in die Arztbriefschreibung hat das Potenzial, die Genauigkeit und Effizienz des Prozesses zu steigern. KI-Unterstützung stellt daher eine vielversprechende Möglichkeit zur Verbesserung von Arztbriefen dar. Eine smarte Promptgestaltung erscheint auch bei dieser Aufgabe für große Sprachmodelle (LLM) entscheidend zu sein. Durch die Einbindung von KI können die Supervision und die Qualitätskontrolle in der medizinischen Dokumentation erheblich verbessert werden.}

abstract = {Objective
This systematic review aimed to summarize and evaluate the available information regarding the performance of artificial intelligence on dental implant classification and peri-implant pathology identification in 2D radiographs.
Data Sources
Electronic databases (Medline, Embase, and Cochrane) were searched up to September 2024 for relevant observational studies and both randomized and controlled clinical trials. The search was limited to studies published in English from the last 7 years. Two reviewers independently conducted both study selection and data extraction. Risk of bias assessment was also performed individually by both operators using the Quality Assessment Diagnostic Tool (QUADAS-2).
Study Selection
Of the 1,465 records identified, 29 references were selected to perform qualitative analysis. The study characteristics were tabulated in a self-designed table. QUADAS-2 tool identified 10 and 15 studies to respectively have a high and an unclear risk of bias, while only four were categorized as low risk of bias. Overall, accuracy rates for dental implant classification ranged from 67 % to 99 %. Peri-implant pathology identification showed results with accuracy detection rates over 78,6 %.
Conclusions
While AI-based models, particularly convolutional neural networks, have shown high accuracy in dental implant classification and peri-implant pathology detection, several limitations must be addressed before widespread clinical application. More advanced AI techniques, such as Federated Learning should be explored to improve the generalizability and efficiency of these models in clinical practice.
Clinical Significance
AI-based models offer can and clinicians to accurately classify unknown dental implants and enable early detection of peri-implantitis, improving patient outcomes and streamline treatment planning.}

Empathy is a driving force in our connection to others, our mental well-being, and resilience to challenges. With the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems, mental health chatbots, and AI social support companions, it is important to understand how empathy unfolds toward stories from human versus AI narrators and how transparency plays a role in user emotions.
Objective
We aim to understand how empathy shifts across human-written versus AI-written stories, and how these findings inform ethical implications and human-centered design of using mental health chatbots as objects of empathy.
Methods
We conducted crowd-sourced studies with 985 participants who each wrote a personal story and then rated empathy toward 2 retrieved stories, where one was written by a language model, and another was written by a human. Our studies varied disclosing whether a story was written by a human or an AI system to see how transparent author information affects empathy toward the narrator. We conducted mixed methods analyses: through statistical tests, we compared user’s self-reported state empathy toward the stories across different conditions. In addition, we qualitatively coded open-ended feedback about reactions to the stories to understand how and why transparency affects empathy toward human versus AI storytellers.
Results
We found that participants significantly empathized with human-written over AI-written stories in almost all conditions, regardless of whether they are aware (t196=7.07, P<.001, Cohen d=0.60) or not aware (t298=3.46, P<.001, Cohen d=0.24) that an AI system wrote the story. We also found that participants reported greater willingness to empathize with AI-written stories when there was transparency about the story author (t494=–5.49, P<.001, Cohen d=0.36).
