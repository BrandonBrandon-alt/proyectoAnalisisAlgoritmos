abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology in healthcare education with potential to enhance simulation by addressing logistical barriers and by providing increased access to diverse settings in healthcare education, leading to improved learning outcomes. This rapid scoping review explores the use of generative AI in simulation-based education.
Methods
Searches were conducted in CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science using terms such as “generative artificial intelligence” and “healthcare simulation.” The review followed the World Health Organization (WHO) Rapid Review Guide and was structured using Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework for scoping reviews.
Results
After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 articles were included. Five themes emerged: (1) removal of logistical barriers, (2) authentic practice, (3) distinctive value, (4) limitations of generative AI, and (5) potential with human oversight. Generative AI improves access to simulation by creating cost-effective, scalable, and realistic scenarios while fostering critical thinking through reflective learning. However, challenges such as misinformation and ethical concerns remain.
Conclusions
This scoping review identified growing momentum around generative AI's role in healthcare simulation. While early studies highlight its potential to support scalable, adaptive, and authentic training experiences, effective integration requires strong governance, ethical safeguards, and human oversight.}

abstract = {The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping technological pathways in the global energy transition. While AI holds great potential to enhance the efficiency, resilience, and integration of renewable energy systems, its effective deployment depends heavily on supportive financial structures. Moreover, empirical assessments of AI’s macroeconomic impact are limited by the absence of standardized, internationally comparable measures of AI development. To address this problem, we construct a multidimensional AI composite index using the projection pursuit method, integrating eleven indicators across scientific innovation, infrastructure support, and global competitiveness. The index spans 119 countries from 2010 to 2022, offering improved spatial-temporal coverage for global analysis. Using this dataset, we empirically investigate the effect of AI on renewable energy transition and explore the mediating and threshold roles of financial development. We apply a suite of econometric models, including fixed-effect regression, mediation effect regression, dynamic threshold effect regression, and robustness check using industrial robot proxies and GMM. Results show that AI development significantly promotes the energy transition toward renewables. This finding holds true in both low-income and high-income countries. However, the role of financial development is twofold: it mediates AI’s impact, but in its current fossil fuel–biased form, may also exert a suppressive effect on green transformation. Notably, once financial development surpasses a critical threshold, the influence of AI on energy transition is amplified. Our findings offer new insights into the interaction between digital innovation and sustainable finance, and provide timely evidence for designing financial and technological policies that support AI-driven renewable energy transition.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) has emerged as a transformative technology driving environmental sustainability in smart city development. However, the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) within AIoT ecosystems remains largely unexplored. Current research predominantly addresses conventional AIoT frameworks, overlooking the innovative potential of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, Diffusion Models, Transformers, and hybrid architectures, to significantly enhance situational awareness, system optimization, operational robustness, real-time responsiveness, and adaptive decision-making in complex urban environments. AIoT systems continue to face persistent challenges, including data scarcity, poor data quality, limited adaptability, imbalanced datasets, and inadequate context-awareness. This study addresses these gaps by systematically exploring how GenAI can enhance AIoT functionalities across key domains—namely cognitive augmentation, resource efficiency, network traffic, cybersecurity, and anomaly detection—while examining their synergistic potential to improve system-level environmental performance across two interconnected layers in sustainable smart cities. At the operational layer, key findings reveal that integrating GenAI with AIoT systems enhances urban efficiency, adaptability, autonomy, robustness, and resilience by conserving resources, optimizing network traffic flows, securing infrastructures, and detecting anomalies before they escalate. Specifically, the fusion of generative intelligence with federated learning promotes sustainable, energy-efficient AIoT deployments by reducing data transmission, thereby lowering communication overhead and safeguarding user privacy. In networked environments, generative models improve synthetic traffic realism and communication efficiency. They also strengthen cybersecurity through enhanced intrusion prevention and threat detection. Additionally, they enable early identification and mitigation of anomalies, boosting operational efficiency and system robustness. These improvements stabilize sustainable smart city system functioning and prevent disruptive failures. At the environmental layer, as key findings indicate, these operational gains cascade into indirect but tangible ecological benefits, while generative models advance the core pillars of AIoT by enabling proactive, autonomous, context-aware, and self-adaptive systems that further enhance the environmental performance of sustainable smart cities. Thus, while the five domains primarily underpin the operational backbone of urban systems, their cascading effects extend to ecological outcomes. The proposed conceptual framework, distilled from key findings, integrates GenAI and AIoT and highlights both domain-specific advancements and their synergistic interactions. This framework holds significant potential to drive sustainable smart city development by fostering AIoT ecosystems that are more intelligent, resource-efficient, adaptive, secure, robust, and autonomous through the strategic application of generative intelligence. The insights gained from this study provide policymakers, urban planners, system designers, and technology developers with practical guidance to harness GAIoT for enhancing smart city resilience, sustainability, and operational intelligence.}

A total of 102 (37% of the total cohort) master’s students in engineering management provided complete responses. This study builds on the research by Johnson et al. [1], which analyzed 2 555 foundation, undergraduate, structured postgraduate, and research postgraduate students at the University of Liverpool. It enhances their postgraduate findings by specifically examining working professionals in a part-time structured master’s program in South Africa. The differing educational and cultural contexts between this study and that of Johnson et al. [1] expand the investigation's scope and facilitate a valuable comparison of student views on AI and GenAI, thus deepening our understanding of how various institutional settings affect technology use in higher education. The findings indicate the students’ personal use of AI and GenAI, perspectives on peers’ use, and opinions on appropriate policies at the university, program, and module levels. Participants were surveyed on their confidence in academic writing, home languages, and familiarity with AI and GenAI tools. They described how they use these technologies in both personal and academic contexts, the perceived quality of AI-generated content compared to their own work, and their perspectives on others’ use of the technologies in an academic setting. Finally, respondents shared their views on the need for institutional regulations to guide ethical and responsible AI usage. Overall, the dataset serves as a valuable resource for education researchers and policymakers seeking to understand students’ perceptions and needs regarding AI and GenAI in higher education. Although this survey focused on master’s students in engineering management, the questions and findings can be readily adapted to other fields of study and potentially extended to younger student populations, offering insights into support and guidelines necessary to avoid misconduct and overreliance on AI.}

Conventional optimization methods primarily focus on enhancing the performance or reducing the cost of buildings, while ensuring that they satisfy certain structural design requirements. However, these methods often suffer from low optimization efficiencies and struggle to satisfy implicit design constraints. Recent rapid advances in data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches enable the extraction of implicit design knowledge from extensive datasets and efficient handling of complex optimization tasks, thereby introducing new possibilities for optimization design. The integration of data-driven AI methods into structural optimization has led to the growth of research on intelligent optimization design for building structures, demonstrating significant potential for generating initial designs, simplifying optimization problems, solving the related models, and evaluating the results. This study systematically reviews data-driven intelligent optimization design for building structures, with the aim of classifying various optimization techniques, and summarizing the distinct roles of data-driven AI methods in intelligent optimization design. The findings indicate a significant upward trend in the application of intelligent optimization methods, while the emergence of novel AI techniques presents both opportunities and challenges. This study also aims to provide a comprehensive reference for methods and application scenarios of intelligent optimization design for building structures; this helps designers leverage the learning capabilities of data-driven AI approaches alongside the quantitative-analysis strengths of optimization methods to enhance the quality and efficiency of building structures.}

At the same time, many proposals for translating ethics into AI, as well as the first agreements by regulators governing the use of artificial intelligence (AI), have surfaced. This underscores the need for Trustworthy AI, which implies reliability, compliance, and ethics. However, there is still a lack of unified criteria, and more critically, a lack of systematic methodologies for operationalizing trustworthiness within AI development processes. Trustworthiness is crucial, as it ensures that the system performs consistently under expected conditions while adhering to moral and legal standards. The problem of ensuring trustworthiness must be addressed as a preliminary step in creating a methodology for building AI systems with these desirable features. Based on a systematic literature review (SLR), we analyze the ethical, legal, and technological challenges that AI projects face, identifying key considerations and gaps in current approaches. This article presents a detailed and structured sociotechnical taxonomy related to the concept of Trustworthy AI, grounded in the analysis of all relevant texts on the topic, and designed to enable the systematic integration of ethical, legal, and technological principles into AI development processes. The taxonomy establishes a sociotechnical foundation that reflects the interconnected nature of technological, ethical, and legal considerations, and serves as the conceptual basis for CRISP-TAI, a proposed specialized development lifecycle currently under validation, aimed at systematically operationalizing trustworthiness principles across all phases of AI system engineering.}

This work shows where NHS carbon reporting omits AI-related emissions and proposes feasible accounting and procurement measures that allow trusts to assess whether AI adoption advances or undermines net zero. A review of NHS sustainability guidance, the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs conversion factors, and recent evidence on AI energy use shows that current Scopes 1-3 accounting omits substantial emissions at 3 points. First, a lack of granularity provides averages that can obscure the extreme energy intensity of certain AI workloads. Second, life-cycle emissions from specialized hardware (eg, graphics processing units) are often excluded unless trusts own the equipment, ignoring upstream manufacturing impacts. Third, widespread use of unprocured generative AI tools is unmeasured; extrapolating general practice survey data suggests that ChatGPT queries alone could release ≈ 349t CO₂e per year in primary care. To close these gaps, we propose three potential ways to help reduce these reporting gaps: (1) AI-specific carbon disclosure clauses in vendor contracts, (2) inclusion of cradle-to-grave emission factors for AI hardware in Scope 3 reporting, and (3) lightweight monitoring of external AI traffic (while recognizing potential ethical issues with this). Implementing these measures would give health care leaders a more accurate baseline against which to judge whether AI supports or undermines the NHS net-zero target.}

Traditional PFP systems are effective in an era of static evaluations and infrequent feedback, but they lack the intelligence and flexibility needed for today's dynamic work environments. In response, we introduce algorithm-based PFP (APFP) systems—PFP systems that leverage AI and GenAI to enable real-time adaptability, predictive capabilities, customization, automated algorithmic recommending, and measurement sophistication. We then use the APFP framework to assess its implications for three foundational PFP theories (equity theory, expectancy theory, and tournament theory). The APFP framework integrates established PFP principles with AI and GenAI capabilities, reassessing how employees perceive, respond to, and engage with PFP systems. By conceptualizing how AI and GenAI influence the theoretical mechanisms of PFP, we offer a lens for understanding their influence on foundational PFP theories. Our theoretical contributions bridge existing PFP theories with emerging AI- and GenAI-driven environments to advance the literature and lay a foundation for future research that highlights inherent benefits and risks of APFP systems.}

Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) a device that uses the basic physics of friction, electrostatics, and induction to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. It is a cost and environmentally friendly device for energy production. Integrating Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms into TENG devices may overcome the challenges of material selection, output performance prediction, structural design optimization, and durability. AI, (ML/DL) techniques algorithms, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), k-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), artificial neural networks (ANNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), reinforcement learning (RL) can resolve the challenges of material selection, enhancement of output performance, device parameter optimization and structural optimization. These algorithms can help in analysing the data of SEM, TEM, AFM images that can help in understanding the output voltage, current and charge density and simultaneously, able to predict the output performance of TENG devices. This study explores the transformative potential of AI-driven TENGs to revolutionize the future energy systems by improving charge density, durability, and structural design. The integration of AI and advanced materials such as biodegradable polymers, 2D nanomaterials, high dielectric materials and perovskites has further enabled the development of next-generation self-powered devices. Although the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) has been explored in numerous high-quality research articles across various applications, there is a surprising lack of comprehensive review articles dedicated to this emerging field. This review aims to fill that gap by highlighting the synergistic relationship between TENG technology and AI methodologies, particularly machine learning and deep learning.

Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance in healthcare, offering innovative approaches to enhance clinical decision-making and patient management. Peripheral nerve surgery poses unique challenges due to the complexity of cases and the need for precise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This study investigates the application of OpenAI's generative AI model, o1, in assisting with intricate decision-making processes in peripheral nerve surgery.
Methods
Using advanced prompt engineering techniques, o1 was configured as a virtual medical assistant (Generative Pretrained Transformer–Nerve Surgery [GPT-NS]) to process 5 simulated clinical scenarios modeled after real-world cases. The AI guided surgeons through medical history, diagnostics, and treatment planning, culminating in case summaries. A panel of nerve surgery specialists and residents evaluated the AI's performance using a Likert scale across 7 criteria.
Results
GPT-NS demonstrated strong capabilities, achieving an average score of 4.3. High ratings were observed for understanding clinical issues and case presentation clarity. However, areas for improvement were noted in diagnostic sequencing and treatment recommendations. Despite a lower score indicating human evaluators’ perception of their superiority over the AI in handling cases, GPT-NS showed promise as a supportive tool in clinical practice.
Conclusions
As the performance of large language model AI continues to improve, it is becoming increasingly important that absolute experts assess the accuracy of the answers to ensure reliable and clinically sound integration into healthcare practices. This study underscores the potential of large language model AI in augmenting clinical decision-making in highly specialized fields like peripheral nerve surgery while demonstrating the ongoing importance of human expertise.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can generate synthetic dermoscopic images to augment limited real datasets, but the lack of standardised validation protocols holds back models’ reliability and clinicians’ trust. This study aims to design and develop a systematic validation protocol combining quantitative metrics and qualitative expert assessments to evaluate the realism, fidelity, diversity, and usefulness of synthetic dermoscopic melanoma images. A StyleGAN2 model, designed and trained in a previous study, was selected for its superior quantitative performance and exploited to generate 25 synthetic melanoma images, matched with 25 real images. A panel of 17 dermoscopists assessed the images using a 7-point Likert scale, across multiple qualitative attributes (real vs. synthetic, skin texture, visual realism, and confidence) and pattern analysis. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Fleiss’ Kappa, and Krippendorff’s Alpha were calculated to analyse inter-rater agreement and evaluation outcomes. Accuracy in real vs synthetic images classification was moderate (64 %), with sensitivity at 73 % and specificity at 56 %, with poor inter-rater concordance over qualitative attributes. Synthetic images obtained superior scores in medium visual and overall realism, and confidence level, while the frequency of recognition of pigment network-patterns was comparable with real images. The proposed holistic validation protocol can effectively estimate the quality level of synthetic dermoscopic images, regardless of the architecture of the model used for generation, offering an objective and reliable evaluation tool, as qualitative evaluations remain crucial to ensure their safe deployment in clinical settings.}

abstract = {Sustainable electrical energy (SEE) represents a direct and indirect critical enabling factor for sustainable development. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a disruptive technology that accelerates the transition toward full SEE, but concurrently, presents a fatal issue. This study inspects the benefits and limitations of AI applications in the context of SEE. The primary finding highlights a common assumption: AI utilization in areas such as green power generation, electric vehicles, and so on is often deemed, per se, sufficient to achieve full SEE. However, the study highlights a critical shortcoming of this perspective: the absence of a holistic SEE. Achieving full SEE requires integrating the life cycle assessment, which evaluates the environmental impact from raw material extraction to end-of-life management. This ensures considering the environmental adverse effects of green technologies such as renewables and electric transportation, thus embracing a real technology neutrality. Additionally, a thorough consideration of electrical energy production and consumption is necessary. Moreover, it emerged that AI-based holistic planning enabling a fully green-supplied power system has not been sufficiently investigated so far. In conclusion, the first part of the study has brought out that a transition toward fully sustainable electricity imposes that AI considers the design for sustainability paradigm and a holistic view of sustainability that combines life cycle assessment and exploitable electrical energy. The large room for improvement in the adoption of AI for full SEE and its imperative priority ask for an urgent research effort of academia and industry. With this in mind, some figures of merit have been discussed. The second part of this study investigates the main sustainability challenges of AI. The analysis of the (e−)waste, pollution, and energy demand has highlighted that AI widespread use is untenable with the current technologies. The key issue is the unsustainable growth of electrical energy consumption due to AI, which incontrovertibly emerges as the core challenge, because the research effort has focused on achieving even-increasing accuracy regardless of the energy consumption. Large diffusion of humanoids that would exploit various AI tools to face different problems while using large language models and generative AI systems will skyrocket energy demand. Natural evolution has inherently optimized the human brain for energy efficiency, while the evolution of AI has led, conversely, to energy-inefficient outcomes. Therefore, a worldwide research effort must be lavished on developing low-energy-demand AI while keeping sufficient accuracy. In conclusion, all the research efforts have focused so far on providing AI with human skills until reaching super-human abilities, overlooking the crucial one: very low-energy-demand high-computing aptitude.}

While traditional experimental methods are reliable, they are often time-consuming and resource-intensive. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have transformed ADME prediction, improving efficiency in the early stages of drug development. This chapter overviews the ML models that are commonly used in ADME predictions, including random forests, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks, and predicts key ADME properties such as oral bioavailability, plasma protein binding, and hepatic clearance using large datasets. Deep neural networks, including convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, further enhance the ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships in ADME data. Additionally, generative AI techniques, such as variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, are expanding the discovery of novel compounds with optimized ADME profiles. Additionally, we discuss the integration of public and proprietary databases, in vitro models, and challenges in data quality and standardization. Case studies demonstrate the transformative potential of AI-driven models in optimizing pharmacokinetic profiles and accelerating drug development.}

This paper explores how AI systems and chatbots, notably ChatGPT, can perpetuate gender biases due to inherent flaws in training data, algorithms, and user feedback loops. This problem stems from several sources, including biased training datasets, algorithmic design choices, and human biases. To mitigate these issues, various interventions are discussed, including improving data quality, diversifying datasets and annotator pools, integrating fairness-centric algorithmic approaches, and establishing robust policy frameworks at corporate, national, and international levels.

This study draws on a systematic literature review to assess AI methods utilized in the context of EWS, examines their challenges and opportunities and discusses guiding questions for responsible use. Our study highlights key gaps across knowledge, application and policy. Moreover, we call for coordinated efforts to develop responsible AI frameworks that enhance EWS while ensuring they remain inclusive, accessible, and people-centred - ultimately supporting the goal of EW4All by 2027.}

The diagnosis and treatment of hematologic disorders depend on the integration of diverse data sources, such as imaging, pathology, omics, and laboratory parameters. The increasing volume and complexity of patient data have made clinical decision-making more challenging. AI/ML hold significant potential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy, risk stratification, and treatment response prediction through advanced modeling techniques. Generative AI, a recent advancement within the broader field of AI, is poised to have a profound impact on healthcare and hematology. Generative AI can enhance the development of novel therapeutic strategies, improve diagnostic workflows by generating high-fidelity images or pathology reports, and facilitate more personalized approaches to patient management. Its ability to augment clinical decision-making and streamline research represents a significant leap forward in the field. However, despite this potential, few AI/ML tools have been fully implemented in clinical practice due to challenges related to data quality, equity, advanced infrastructure, and the establishment of robust evaluation metrics. Despite its promise, AI implementation in hematology faces critical challenges, including bias, data quality issues, and a lack of regulatory frameworks and safety standards that keep pace with rapid technological advancements. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of AI/ML in hematology as of 2025, identify existing gaps, and offer insights into future developments.}

Artificial intelligence could contribute to transform cardiology through a Perception, Reasoning and Action framework. In the Perception phase, artificial intelligence can improve data acquisition. The Reasoning stage involves artificial intelligence-driven data analysis, integrating large datasets to support clinical decision-making and personalized treatment plans. In the Action phase, artificial intelligence optimizes therapeutic interventions, automates clinical workflows and enhances patient engagement. Artificial intelligence might therefore free up time for cardiologists to focus more on direct patient care and less on data acquisition and analysis, although their supervision remains essential. This review also addresses the technical and ethical challenges of artificial intelligence, including quality of datasets, algorithmic bias, the need for explainable artificial intelligence and data privacy, while exploring future perspectives, such as quantum computing and interdisciplinary collaboration.

Current AI systems have demonstrated the capacity for achieving defined test goals for ‘intelligence’. The aviation industry is increasingly interested in adopting AI to improve efficiency, safety, and cost efficiency; with the Generative Pre-trained Transformers’ (GPT) capability to reduce resource-intensive analytics in accident causation classification. This study investigates the potential and challenges of using AI to analyze human factors involved in aviation accidents based on the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). Six subject-matter experts in aviation human factors and AI domain participated in this research. All participants were familiar with the HFACS framework to analyze aviation accident reports and the output of GPT which were based on the prompt engineering developed by the research team. This research creates a framework to perform its initial generation and training using GE 235 accident investigation report from Taiwan Transportation Safety Board (TTSB). Initial discoveries demonstrated that the AI model could populate the sub-dimensions of Level 1 HFACS framework with moderate accuracy, although there remains a high presence of hallucinations in generated outputs, with a lack of reproducibility in consecutive outputs with consistent input data. There are still different opinions on AI applications in real-world operations with ethics and safety concerns. While there is clear potential for GPT models to supplement accident analysis within the HFACS framework, there is still more work to integrate HFACS framework into GPT modelling for effective generation to accident data.}

But public views of AI's role remain underexplored. Given widespread skepticism, integrating AI into deliberative formats may lower trust and willingness to participate. We report a preregistered within-subjects survey experiment with a representative German sample (n = 1850) testing how information about AI-facilitated deliberation affects willingness to participate and expected quality. Respondents were randomly assigned to descriptions of identical deliberative tasks facilitated by either AI or humans, enabling causal identification of information effects. Results show a clear AI penalty: participants were less willing to engage in AI-facilitated deliberation and anticipated lower deliberative quality than for human-facilitated formats. The penalty shrank among respondents who perceived greater societal benefits of AI or tended to anthropomorphize it, but grew with higher assessments of AI risk. These findings indicate that AI-facilitated deliberation currently faces substantial public skepticism and may create a new “deliberative divide.” Unlike traditional participation gaps linked to education or demographics, this divide reflects attitudes toward AI. Efforts to realize AI's affordances should directly address these perceptions to offset the penalty and avoid discouraging participation or exacerbating participatory inequalities.}

abstract = {Objective
Qualitative research remains underutilized in health professions education in part due to insufficient training and time-intensive analytic methods. Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence offer new opportunities to streamline the qualitative research process using large language models, such as GPT-4. However, the accuracy of GPT-4-generated codes and themes remains underexplored in health professions education research. This study characterizes qualitative analyses assisted by a general-purpose GPT-4 compared to traditional human-conducted analyses.
Methods
Two health professions datasets were previously analyzed using content or thematic analysis and then re-analyzed using a version of GPT-4. Researchers compared the accuracy, alignment, relevance, and appropriateness of codebooks and themes produced by GPT-4 with the prior findings. Dichotomous numerical ratings and explanations were assessed independently and then discussed collaboratively to identify strengths and weaknesses associated with GPT-4 qualitative analysis.
Results
Thirty-six survey responses and seven 1-hour interview transcripts were analyzed using GPT-4. The codebooks and themes generated by GPT-4 generally aligned with human-identified concepts. Challenges included failure to detect low frequency codes, difficulty constructing coherent code relationships, and a lack of nuance in theme descriptions and quote selection.
Conclusion
GPT-4 can support, though not replace, human-led qualitative analysis. A general understanding of qualitative research processes and the dataset is necessary for researchers to identify potential gaps, limitations, and redundancies in qualitative findings generated by GPT-4.}

The Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (RAPNO) criteria provide an important framework for evaluating treatment efficacy and tumour progression in clinical studies of paediatric brain tumours. As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly transforms clinical practice, integrating AI into the RAPNO framework presents a unique opportunity to enhance quantitative, data-driven approaches for response assessment. However, successful clinical implementation faces challenges, including variability in imaging protocols, scarce annotated datasets, and regulatory and ethical considerations. To address these barriers, this Policy Review, led by the AI for Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (AI-RAPNO) subcommittee, outlines key challenges and proposes recommendations to improve AI trustworthiness, generalisability, and implementation in paediatric neuro-oncology. We highlight the potential of AI for response assessment, multimodal integration, and synthetic control groups in clinical trials. Our recommendations emphasise the need for standardised imaging protocols, robust validation frameworks, and infrastructure to support AI readiness in clinical studies. By addressing these needs, AI-RAPNO aims to bridge the gap between AI research and clinical application, ensuring reliable and actionable AI-driven tools for paediatric neuro-oncology.}

Background
The objective of the present systematic review is to identify which artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been used to successfully detect voice disorders. The review examines studies involving patients with non-neurological voice disorders and controls, where AI was applied to detect voice disorders. The primary outcome of interest is the accuracy of these AI models. Additionally, this review demonstrates how the procedures of conducting a systematic review can be supported by AI.
Methods
Studies were eligible for inclusion if they implemented an AI approach to detect non-neurological voice disorders from healthy voice samples. A comprehensive search was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE, Science Direct, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Scopus databases. Risk of bias was assessed via the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies. The occurrences of the most common AI techniques utilized in the literature are presented, and a summary of their abilities to accurately detect a voice disorder is reported.
Results
In total, 79 publications met the inclusion criteria. These studies included patient recordings from a variety of voice databases. The most common AI techniques implemented were Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (n = 28) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (n = 22). The mean accuracy of the models in detecting voice disorders was 92% across all studies. Nine studies reported 100% accuracy, and 32 studies reported between 95% and 99%.
Discussion

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) will impact a large proportion of jobs in the short to medium term, especially in the developed countries. The consequences will be felt across many sectors including health care, a critical sector for implementation of AI tools because glitches in algorithms or biases in training datasets may lead to suboptimal treatment that may negatively affect the health of an individual. The stakes are obviously higher in case of potentially life-threatening diseases such as cancer and therapies with a potential for causing severe or even fatal adverse events. Over the last two decades, much of the research on AI in health care has focussed on diagnostic radiology and digital pathology, but a solid body of research is emerging on AI tools in the radiation oncology workflow. Many of these applications are relatively uncontroversial, although there is still a lack of evidence regarding effectiveness rather than efficiency, and—the ultimate bar—evidence of clinical utility. Proponents of AI will argue that these algorithms should be implemented with robust human supervision. One challenge here is the deskilling effect associated with new technologies. We will become increasingly dependent on the AI tools over time, and we will become less capable of assessing the quality of the AI output. Much of this research appears almost old-fashioned in view of the rapid advances in Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). GenAI can draw from multiple types of data and produce output that is personalised and appears relevant in the given context. Especially the rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) has opened a wide field of potential applications that were out of bounds just a few years ago. One LLM, Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), has been made widely accessible to end-users as ChatGPT-4, which passed a rigorous Turing test in a recent study. In this viewpoint, I argue for the necessity of independent academic research to establish evidence-based applications of AI in medicine. Algorithmic medicine is an intervention similar to a new drug or a new medical device. We should be especially concerned about under-represented minorities and rare/atypical clinical cases that may drown in the petabyte-sized training sets. A huge educational push is needed to ensure that the end-users of AI in health care understand the strengths and weaknesses of algorithmic medicine. Finally, we need to address the ethical boundaries for where and when GenAI can replace humans in the relation between patients and healthcare providers.}

abstract = {The study explored how Arab academic libraries are adopting artificial intelligence (AI) and examined the awareness of AI ethical considerations from the perspectives of Arab academic librarians. It utilized a survey-based approach, employing a snowball sampling technique across 48 academic libraries in 17 Arab countries. The research instrument was a web-based questionnaire, which received responses from a total of 272 participants. The findings revealed that 37.5 % of respondents indicated that their libraries use AI, with cataloging and generating metadata being the most common applications used by 43 % of libraries. The study highlighted several challenges to AI adoption in Arab academic libraries, including a lack of necessary infrastructure and staff training. Moreover, about 81 % of Arab academic librarians believed that intellectual property and copyright are the most important ethical considerations regarding AI. However, only 12% of participants reported having encountered ethical issues related to AI use in their library work. The results indicated that the primary actions taken by Arab academic libraries were offering face-to-face or online seminars and workshops on AI ethics, as well as providing ethical considerations and resources related to academic integrity through their websites. The study recommended that Arab academic libraries organize appropriate training programs to improve AI literacy among staff, develop the necessary infrastructure for AI adoption, and prepare relevant policy documents to guide the ethical use of AI technologies.}

This prospective exploratory study included 20 adults who visited their first outpatient clinic due to hepatobiliary or pancreatic conditions. Consultations were audio-recorded, transcribed using Whisper-1 (OpenAI), and converted into structured Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) clinical notes using ChatGPT 3.5 (OpenAI), implemented through Python 3.11.6. The transcriptions were manually reviewed against gold-standard references, and the ASR performance was quantified using standard metrics from the Jiwer library. Descriptive statistics were computed, and the ChatGPT note quality was evaluated using a standardized checklist, before assessing for statistical significance. The median patient age was 47 years (65 % female). The average interview duration was 15.98 min. Whisper transcribed audio in a median of 59.3 s, and ChatGPT generated SOAP notes in 5.7 s. ChatGPT produced satisfactory results in 85 % of cases, with a significant performance. The ASR system demonstrated acceptable transcription quality. The integration of Whisper and ChatGPT drastically reduced the documentation time compared with manual electronic health record (EHR) entry. Despite some limitations, these results highlight the promise of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered documentation tools in outpatient practice. Further research with larger samples and direct comparisons with traditional methods is warranted to confirm these findings and address the ethical, legal, and implementation challenges associated with AI in clinical environments.}

abstract = {Objective
To assess the ability of humans to differentiate human-authored vs artificial intelligence (AI)–generated medical manuscripts.
Methods
This is a prospective randomized survey study from October 1, 2023, to December 1, 2023, from a single academic center. Artificial intelligence–generated medical manuscripts were created using ChatGPT 3.5 and were evaluated alongside randomly selected human-authored manuscripts. Participants, who were blinded from manuscript selection and creation, were randomized to receive three manuscripts that were either human-authored or AI-generated and had to fill out a survey questionnaire after review regarding who authored the manuscript. The primary outcome was accuracy of human reviewers in differentiating manuscript authors. Secondary outcomes were to identify factors that influenced prediction accuracy.
Results
Fifty-one physicians were included in the study, including 12 post-doctorates, 19 assistant professors, and 20 associate or full professors. The overall specificity of 55.6% (95% CI, 30.8% to 78.5%), sensitivity of 31.2% (95% CI,11.0% to 58.7%), positive predictive value of 38.5% (95% CI,13.9% to 68.4%) and negative predictive value of 47.6% (95% CI, 25.7% to 70.2%). A stratified analysis of human-authored manuscripts indicated that high-impact factor manuscripts were identified with higher accuracy than low-impact factor ones (P=.037). For individual-level data, neither academic rank nor prior manuscript review experience significantly predicted the accuracy. The frequency of AI interaction was a significant factor, with occasional (odds ratio [OR], 8.20; P=.016), fairly frequent (OR, 7.13; P=.033), and very frequent (OR, 8.36; P=.030) use associated with correct identification. Further analysis revealed no significant predictors among the papers' qualities.
Conclusion
Generative AI such as ChatGPT could create medical manuscripts that could not be differentiated from human-authored manuscripts.}

For a variety of time-intensive steps, numerous types of applications are now available with variable reported measures and degrees of success. The tools we highlight aim to accelerate imaging acquisition, reduce cognitive and manual burden on radiologists and others involved in the care pathway, improve diagnostic accuracy, and shorten the time to clinical action based on imaging results. Most existing studies have focused on intermediate outcomes, such as task duration or time to the next step in care. In this article, we present an examination of AI applications across the medical imaging exam workflow, review examples of real-world evidence on these tools, and summarize the relevant performance metrics by application type. Beyond the more immediately acquired measures, to demonstrate benefit to patient health and economic outcomes, a more integrated assessment is necessary, and in an iterative fashion. To evolve beyond early workflow gains, interoperable tools must be tied to measurable downstream impacts, such as reduced disease severity, lower mortality, and shorter hospital stays, while we acknowledge that current empirical evaluations are limited.}

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an intractable problem that has the potential to significantly limit advances in human health. Recently, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) High-Level Statement on AMR defined targets for addressing the impact of resistance on human, animal, and environmental health. For human health, the discovery and development of new antibiotics, antimicrobial stewardship programmes, antimicrobial surveillance, and infection control and prevention are all key areas. Artificial intelligence (AI) is ideally placed to help achieve the UNGA targets via its role in revealing patterns in data that are clinically indiscernible, and using that information to build clinical decision support systems. However, significant barriers remain in terms of necessary infrastructure, know-how, and the implementation of AI approaches. In this Series paper, we consider the potential applications of AI in combatting the AMR problem through drug discovery and development, antimicrobial stewardship, diagnostics, and surveillance, and their use in public health. We then discuss the technical, infrastructure, regulatory, ethical, and policy challenges that affect these domains.}

abstract = {Objectives
With the escalating global burden of cancer, there is an increasing imperative to adopt holistic, person-centered approaches that address the complex and evolving care needs of individuals across the cancer continuum. Integrating advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) into conventional cancer care models offers significant potential to enhance the responsiveness, inclusivity, and sustainability of cancer care delivery. This paper aimed to explore how the Caring Life Course Theory (CLCT), a comprehensive multidisciplinary framework of care, can inform and enhance the integration of AI into cancer care delivery.
Methods
A conceptual synthesis and narrative synthesis were employed to explore and understand how CLCT constructs can inform AI applications across different levels of cancer care (individual, relational/network and structural).
Results
AI technologies are being used to support personalized care planning, real-time symptom monitoring, survivorship management, and coordinated service delivery. Guided by the CLCT, these technologies offer a structured and contextually grounded approach to delivering longitudinal, life-course-informed care. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain, including ethical concerns, algorithmic bias, and implementation barriers.
Conclusions
Aligning AI technologies with the CLCT framework can promote more personalized, equitable, and relationally responsive cancer care. Future research must prioritize ethical co-design, accountability, and sustained implementation.
Implications for Nursing Practice
: The integration of CLCT and AI can support nurses in identifying care needs, facilitating remote monitoring, and coordinating personalized care. However, the integration of AI must be approached with critical attention to ethics, equity, and the preservation of fundamental nursing values.}
