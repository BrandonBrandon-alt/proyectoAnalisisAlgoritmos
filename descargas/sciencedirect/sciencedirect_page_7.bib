Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology in healthcare education with potential to enhance simulation by addressing logistical barriers and by providing increased access to diverse settings in healthcare education, leading to improved learning outcomes. This rapid scoping review explores the use of generative AI in simulation-based education.
Methods
Searches were conducted in CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science using terms such as “generative artificial intelligence” and “healthcare simulation.” The review followed the World Health Organization (WHO) Rapid Review Guide and was structured using Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework for scoping reviews.
Results
After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 articles were included. Five themes emerged: (1) removal of logistical barriers, (2) authentic practice, (3) distinctive value, (4) limitations of generative AI, and (5) potential with human oversight. Generative AI improves access to simulation by creating cost-effective, scalable, and realistic scenarios while fostering critical thinking through reflective learning. However, challenges such as misinformation and ethical concerns remain.
Conclusions
This scoping review identified growing momentum around generative AI's role in healthcare simulation. While early studies highlight its potential to support scalable, adaptive, and authentic training experiences, effective integration requires strong governance, ethical safeguards, and human oversight.}

abstract = {The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping technological pathways in the global energy transition. While AI holds great potential to enhance the efficiency, resilience, and integration of renewable energy systems, its effective deployment depends heavily on supportive financial structures. Moreover, empirical assessments of AI’s macroeconomic impact are limited by the absence of standardized, internationally comparable measures of AI development. To address this problem, we construct a multidimensional AI composite index using the projection pursuit method, integrating eleven indicators across scientific innovation, infrastructure support, and global competitiveness. The index spans 119 countries from 2010 to 2022, offering improved spatial-temporal coverage for global analysis. Using this dataset, we empirically investigate the effect of AI on renewable energy transition and explore the mediating and threshold roles of financial development. We apply a suite of econometric models, including fixed-effect regression, mediation effect regression, dynamic threshold effect regression, and robustness check using industrial robot proxies and GMM. Results show that AI development significantly promotes the energy transition toward renewables. This finding holds true in both low-income and high-income countries. However, the role of financial development is twofold: it mediates AI’s impact, but in its current fossil fuel–biased form, may also exert a suppressive effect on green transformation. Notably, once financial development surpasses a critical threshold, the influence of AI on energy transition is amplified. Our findings offer new insights into the interaction between digital innovation and sustainable finance, and provide timely evidence for designing financial and technological policies that support AI-driven renewable energy transition.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) has emerged as a transformative technology driving environmental sustainability in smart city development. However, the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) within AIoT ecosystems remains largely unexplored. Current research predominantly addresses conventional AIoT frameworks, overlooking the innovative potential of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, Diffusion Models, Transformers, and hybrid architectures, to significantly enhance situational awareness, system optimization, operational robustness, real-time responsiveness, and adaptive decision-making in complex urban environments. AIoT systems continue to face persistent challenges, including data scarcity, poor data quality, limited adaptability, imbalanced datasets, and inadequate context-awareness. This study addresses these gaps by systematically exploring how GenAI can enhance AIoT functionalities across key domains—namely cognitive augmentation, resource efficiency, network traffic, cybersecurity, and anomaly detection—while examining their synergistic potential to improve system-level environmental performance across two interconnected layers in sustainable smart cities. At the operational layer, key findings reveal that integrating GenAI with AIoT systems enhances urban efficiency, adaptability, autonomy, robustness, and resilience by conserving resources, optimizing network traffic flows, securing infrastructures, and detecting anomalies before they escalate. Specifically, the fusion of generative intelligence with federated learning promotes sustainable, energy-efficient AIoT deployments by reducing data transmission, thereby lowering communication overhead and safeguarding user privacy. In networked environments, generative models improve synthetic traffic realism and communication efficiency. They also strengthen cybersecurity through enhanced intrusion prevention and threat detection. Additionally, they enable early identification and mitigation of anomalies, boosting operational efficiency and system robustness. These improvements stabilize sustainable smart city system functioning and prevent disruptive failures. At the environmental layer, as key findings indicate, these operational gains cascade into indirect but tangible ecological benefits, while generative models advance the core pillars of AIoT by enabling proactive, autonomous, context-aware, and self-adaptive systems that further enhance the environmental performance of sustainable smart cities. Thus, while the five domains primarily underpin the operational backbone of urban systems, their cascading effects extend to ecological outcomes. The proposed conceptual framework, distilled from key findings, integrates GenAI and AIoT and highlights both domain-specific advancements and their synergistic interactions. This framework holds significant potential to drive sustainable smart city development by fostering AIoT ecosystems that are more intelligent, resource-efficient, adaptive, secure, robust, and autonomous through the strategic application of generative intelligence. The insights gained from this study provide policymakers, urban planners, system designers, and technology developers with practical guidance to harness GAIoT for enhancing smart city resilience, sustainability, and operational intelligence.}

A total of 102 (37% of the total cohort) master’s students in engineering management provided complete responses. This study builds on the research by Johnson et al. [1], which analyzed 2 555 foundation, undergraduate, structured postgraduate, and research postgraduate students at the University of Liverpool. It enhances their postgraduate findings by specifically examining working professionals in a part-time structured master’s program in South Africa. The differing educational and cultural contexts between this study and that of Johnson et al. [1] expand the investigation's scope and facilitate a valuable comparison of student views on AI and GenAI, thus deepening our understanding of how various institutional settings affect technology use in higher education. The findings indicate the students’ personal use of AI and GenAI, perspectives on peers’ use, and opinions on appropriate policies at the university, program, and module levels. Participants were surveyed on their confidence in academic writing, home languages, and familiarity with AI and GenAI tools. They described how they use these technologies in both personal and academic contexts, the perceived quality of AI-generated content compared to their own work, and their perspectives on others’ use of the technologies in an academic setting. Finally, respondents shared their views on the need for institutional regulations to guide ethical and responsible AI usage. Overall, the dataset serves as a valuable resource for education researchers and policymakers seeking to understand students’ perceptions and needs regarding AI and GenAI in higher education. Although this survey focused on master’s students in engineering management, the questions and findings can be readily adapted to other fields of study and potentially extended to younger student populations, offering insights into support and guidelines necessary to avoid misconduct and overreliance on AI.}

Conventional optimization methods primarily focus on enhancing the performance or reducing the cost of buildings, while ensuring that they satisfy certain structural design requirements. However, these methods often suffer from low optimization efficiencies and struggle to satisfy implicit design constraints. Recent rapid advances in data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches enable the extraction of implicit design knowledge from extensive datasets and efficient handling of complex optimization tasks, thereby introducing new possibilities for optimization design. The integration of data-driven AI methods into structural optimization has led to the growth of research on intelligent optimization design for building structures, demonstrating significant potential for generating initial designs, simplifying optimization problems, solving the related models, and evaluating the results. This study systematically reviews data-driven intelligent optimization design for building structures, with the aim of classifying various optimization techniques, and summarizing the distinct roles of data-driven AI methods in intelligent optimization design. The findings indicate a significant upward trend in the application of intelligent optimization methods, while the emergence of novel AI techniques presents both opportunities and challenges. This study also aims to provide a comprehensive reference for methods and application scenarios of intelligent optimization design for building structures; this helps designers leverage the learning capabilities of data-driven AI approaches alongside the quantitative-analysis strengths of optimization methods to enhance the quality and efficiency of building structures.}

At the same time, many proposals for translating ethics into AI, as well as the first agreements by regulators governing the use of artificial intelligence (AI), have surfaced. This underscores the need for Trustworthy AI, which implies reliability, compliance, and ethics. However, there is still a lack of unified criteria, and more critically, a lack of systematic methodologies for operationalizing trustworthiness within AI development processes. Trustworthiness is crucial, as it ensures that the system performs consistently under expected conditions while adhering to moral and legal standards. The problem of ensuring trustworthiness must be addressed as a preliminary step in creating a methodology for building AI systems with these desirable features. Based on a systematic literature review (SLR), we analyze the ethical, legal, and technological challenges that AI projects face, identifying key considerations and gaps in current approaches. This article presents a detailed and structured sociotechnical taxonomy related to the concept of Trustworthy AI, grounded in the analysis of all relevant texts on the topic, and designed to enable the systematic integration of ethical, legal, and technological principles into AI development processes. The taxonomy establishes a sociotechnical foundation that reflects the interconnected nature of technological, ethical, and legal considerations, and serves as the conceptual basis for CRISP-TAI, a proposed specialized development lifecycle currently under validation, aimed at systematically operationalizing trustworthiness principles across all phases of AI system engineering.}

This work shows where NHS carbon reporting omits AI-related emissions and proposes feasible accounting and procurement measures that allow trusts to assess whether AI adoption advances or undermines net zero. A review of NHS sustainability guidance, the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs conversion factors, and recent evidence on AI energy use shows that current Scopes 1-3 accounting omits substantial emissions at 3 points. First, a lack of granularity provides averages that can obscure the extreme energy intensity of certain AI workloads. Second, life-cycle emissions from specialized hardware (eg, graphics processing units) are often excluded unless trusts own the equipment, ignoring upstream manufacturing impacts. Third, widespread use of unprocured generative AI tools is unmeasured; extrapolating general practice survey data suggests that ChatGPT queries alone could release ≈ 349t CO₂e per year in primary care. To close these gaps, we propose three potential ways to help reduce these reporting gaps: (1) AI-specific carbon disclosure clauses in vendor contracts, (2) inclusion of cradle-to-grave emission factors for AI hardware in Scope 3 reporting, and (3) lightweight monitoring of external AI traffic (while recognizing potential ethical issues with this). Implementing these measures would give health care leaders a more accurate baseline against which to judge whether AI supports or undermines the NHS net-zero target.}

In response, we introduce algorithm-based PFP (APFP) systems—PFP systems that leverage AI and GenAI to enable real-time adaptability, predictive capabilities, customization, automated algorithmic recommending, and measurement sophistication. We then use the APFP framework to assess its implications for three foundational PFP theories (equity theory, expectancy theory, and tournament theory). The APFP framework integrates established PFP principles with AI and GenAI capabilities, reassessing how employees perceive, respond to, and engage with PFP systems. By conceptualizing how AI and GenAI influence the theoretical mechanisms of PFP, we offer a lens for understanding their influence on foundational PFP theories. Our theoretical contributions bridge existing PFP theories with emerging AI- and GenAI-driven environments to advance the literature and lay a foundation for future research that highlights inherent benefits and risks of APFP systems.}

These algorithms can help in analysing the data of SEM, TEM, AFM images that can help in understanding the output voltage, current and charge density and simultaneously, able to predict the output performance of TENG devices. This study explores the transformative potential of AI-driven TENGs to revolutionize the future energy systems by improving charge density, durability, and structural design. The integration of AI and advanced materials such as biodegradable polymers, 2D nanomaterials, high dielectric materials and perovskites has further enabled the development of next-generation self-powered devices. Although the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) has been explored in numerous high-quality research articles across various applications, there is a surprising lack of comprehensive review articles dedicated to this emerging field. This review aims to fill that gap by highlighting the synergistic relationship between TENG technology and AI methodologies, particularly machine learning and deep learning. The focus of this paper is on the role of AI in material selection for TENGs and the optimization of device parameters—including output performance, structural design, and long-term stability—through advanced AI techniques.}

abstract = {Background and objective
Artificial intelligence (AI), capable of analyzing vast volume of data rapidly, presents a promising solution to optimize literature screening for systematic reviews (SRs). Using the INSIDE (artificial INtelligence to Support Informed DEcision making) platform, we compared the performance of AI against the “gold standard” traditional SR method in the context of prostate cancer (PC) to assess whether AI could potentially improve efficiency and quality of screening.
Methods
Publications from traditional screening of four SRs (focused on PC therapies and potential cardiotoxicity) were compared with the AI-based approach. Publications were ranked based on relevance scores. Work saved over sampling (WSS), that is, efforts saved by automatically excluding nonrelevant publications, determined efficiency. For a quality analysis, data visualization using a scatter plot suggested the proportions of “relevant,” “irrelevant,” and “not screened” records.
Key findings and limitations
For AI-based screening, an efficiency analysis used publications from the traditional approach (n = 3363) including 278 relevant records. Of the total 3363 publications, the first ranking method screened 2365 and active learning used 3361 records. This approach was more efficient; fewer publications were required to be screened to identify 80% and 95% of 278 relevant publications (WSS@80% 20.3%; WSS@95% 9.4%). Screening efficiency increased with active learning (WSS@80% 54.0%; WSS@95% 54.8%). A scatter plot analysis presented broader search results with the Dimensions database yielding 384 465 publications and helped identify outlier articles.
Conclusions
This study confirms the impact of an AI-based approach in optimizing the SR process. It highlights best practices and benchmarks to assess the efficiency and possibly quality of literature screening, supporting the integration of AI into future SRs.
Patient summary
Systematic reviews (SRs) help create a detailed and unbiased summary on a specific research question. This summary is based on published information. Development of SRs using the traditional method requires detailed in-person review of the records, which takes a lot of time and effort. With the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the key data from a large amount of text are identified faster. This process requires a review of fewer records to find the most relevant ones, which saves time. The aim of this study was to understand how an AI tool, known as INSIDE PC, could help with SRs. This study looked at how well INSIDE PC worked compared with the traditional method for SRs. The AI method scored articles based on their relevance with respect to the topic of this SR. Data visuals or graphs were used to compare data points and remove irrelevant records from the review. This process decreased workload and saved time. The AI method also used a learning algorithm known as active learning. This helps AI tools learn from a small training sample data. Useful records were identified much faster by this method, with less efforts. The results showed that AI could improve the ease and speed of reviewing records for SRs. It is important that these AI methods are tested and improved to meet the needs of SRs.}

Chronic kidney disease is a global health challenge, and effective, individualized nutritional management is crucial for slowing progression and improving quality of life. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers innovative tools to optimize and personalize nutritional care. This review explores AI applications in nutritional management, assessing their impact on clinical outcomes, quality of life, and care efficiency.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted, reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Searches were performed on 5 databases, namely MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and integrated with gray literature sources between September and November 2024. The methodological quality assessment was conducted independently by 2 researchers using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology.
Results
Of 2,053 initial records, 7 studies met inclusion criteria. AI showed significant potential in personalizing dietary recommendations using machine learning, clinical decision support systems, and generative AI tools. These systems tailored nutritional advice based on patient-specific clinical data, reducing complications such as hyperkalemia and improving adherence. AI also facilitated early risk detection and proactive care by monitoring nutritional parameters and predicting complications. In addition, AI-powered platforms enhanced patient education through culturally relevant, intuitive dietary plans and multilingual materials, increasing engagement. AI also improved health care efficiency by automating tasks and integrating with electronic health records.
Conclusions
AI technologies show promise in enhancing nutritional care for patients with chronic kidney disease. Evidence supports their role in improving care quality and dietary adherence. Further research is needed to validate these technologies in clinical practice and ensure integration into routine care pathways.}

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the latest revolutionizing chapters, promising significant advancements in diagnosis, prognosis, segmentation, image quality enhancement, and theranostics. Early AI applications in nuclear medicine focused on improving diagnostic accuracy, leveraging machine learning algorithms for disease classification and outcome prediction. Advances in deep learning, including convolutional and more recently transformer-based neural networks, have further enabled more precise diagnosis and image segmentation as well as low-dose imaging, and patient-specific dosimetry for personalized treatment. Generative AI, driven by large language models and diffusion techniques, is now allowing the process, interpretation, and generation of complex medical language and images. Despite these achievements, challenges such as data scarcity, heterogeneity, and ethical concerns remain barriers to clinical translation. Addressing these issues through interdisciplinary collaboration will pave the way for a broader adoption of AI in nuclear medicine, potentially enhancing patient care and optimizing diagnosis and therapeutic outcomes.}

This study aims to design and develop a systematic validation protocol combining quantitative metrics and qualitative expert assessments to evaluate the realism, fidelity, diversity, and usefulness of synthetic dermoscopic melanoma images. A StyleGAN2 model, designed and trained in a previous study, was selected for its superior quantitative performance and exploited to generate 25 synthetic melanoma images, matched with 25 real images. A panel of 17 dermoscopists assessed the images using a 7-point Likert scale, across multiple qualitative attributes (real vs. synthetic, skin texture, visual realism, and confidence) and pattern analysis. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Fleiss’ Kappa, and Krippendorff’s Alpha were calculated to analyse inter-rater agreement and evaluation outcomes. Accuracy in real vs synthetic images classification was moderate (64 %), with sensitivity at 73 % and specificity at 56 %, with poor inter-rater concordance over qualitative attributes. Synthetic images obtained superior scores in medium visual and overall realism, and confidence level, while the frequency of recognition of pigment network-patterns was comparable with real images. The proposed holistic validation protocol can effectively estimate the quality level of synthetic dermoscopic images, regardless of the architecture of the model used for generation, offering an objective and reliable evaluation tool, as qualitative evaluations remain crucial to ensure their safe deployment in clinical settings.}

abstract = {Sustainable electrical energy (SEE) represents a direct and indirect critical enabling factor for sustainable development. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a disruptive technology that accelerates the transition toward full SEE, but concurrently, presents a fatal issue. This study inspects the benefits and limitations of AI applications in the context of SEE. The primary finding highlights a common assumption: AI utilization in areas such as green power generation, electric vehicles, and so on is often deemed, per se, sufficient to achieve full SEE. However, the study highlights a critical shortcoming of this perspective: the absence of a holistic SEE. Achieving full SEE requires integrating the life cycle assessment, which evaluates the environmental impact from raw material extraction to end-of-life management. This ensures considering the environmental adverse effects of green technologies such as renewables and electric transportation, thus embracing a real technology neutrality. Additionally, a thorough consideration of electrical energy production and consumption is necessary. Moreover, it emerged that AI-based holistic planning enabling a fully green-supplied power system has not been sufficiently investigated so far. In conclusion, the first part of the study has brought out that a transition toward fully sustainable electricity imposes that AI considers the design for sustainability paradigm and a holistic view of sustainability that combines life cycle assessment and exploitable electrical energy. The large room for improvement in the adoption of AI for full SEE and its imperative priority ask for an urgent research effort of academia and industry. With this in mind, some figures of merit have been discussed. The second part of this study investigates the main sustainability challenges of AI. The analysis of the (e−)waste, pollution, and energy demand has highlighted that AI widespread use is untenable with the current technologies. The key issue is the unsustainable growth of electrical energy consumption due to AI, which incontrovertibly emerges as the core challenge, because the research effort has focused on achieving even-increasing accuracy regardless of the energy consumption. Large diffusion of humanoids that would exploit various AI tools to face different problems while using large language models and generative AI systems will skyrocket energy demand. Natural evolution has inherently optimized the human brain for energy efficiency, while the evolution of AI has led, conversely, to energy-inefficient outcomes. Therefore, a worldwide research effort must be lavished on developing low-energy-demand AI while keeping sufficient accuracy. In conclusion, all the research efforts have focused so far on providing AI with human skills until reaching super-human abilities, overlooking the crucial one: very low-energy-demand high-computing aptitude.}

Fellowship programs will need to adopt adaptive learning platforms, high-fidelity simulations, and AI-powered clinical decision support to improve diagnostic acumen, procedural competency, and patient care. This evolution also demands attention to the ethical and legal challenges of AI implementation, including preserving patient autonomy, addressing algorithmic bias, and safeguarding data privacy. Fellows must develop skills to evaluate AI outputs critically and uphold transparent, human-centered care. Artificial intelligence will probably also reshape research practices through predictive analytics, digital twins, and automated trial matching, accelerating discovery in allergic and immunologic disease. Despite these advances, limitations such as the black box problem, lack of emotional intelligence, and misinformed patient self-diagnoses pose challenges. Clinicians will require new communication strategies, including brief cognitive behavioral interventions, to address AI-derived misconceptions and maintain trust. Rather than replacing allergists, AI is likely to expand their roles, freeing time for patient interaction while reinforcing their responsibility as interpreters, educators, and ethical stewards of digital tools.

This paper explores how AI systems and chatbots, notably ChatGPT, can perpetuate gender biases due to inherent flaws in training data, algorithms, and user feedback loops. This problem stems from several sources, including biased training datasets, algorithmic design choices, and human biases. To mitigate these issues, various interventions are discussed, including improving data quality, diversifying datasets and annotator pools, integrating fairness-centric algorithmic approaches, and establishing robust policy frameworks at corporate, national, and international levels. Ultimately, addressing AI bias requires a multi-faceted approach involving researchers, developers, and policymakers to ensure AI systems operate fairly and equitably.}

While concerns about the costs and time required to adopt AI technologies persist, there is a strong willingness within the sector to leverage AI to become more flexible, adaptive to local conditions, and deliver assistance more efficiently and effectively. Drawing on the Knowledge-Based View (KBV), this study examines the application of AI within one of the world's largest humanitarian organisations, Save the Children.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is an attractive option to optimize surgical decision-making. However, multiple ethical concerns exist when applying AI to clinical care. We must consider the benefits of increased efficiency and potential accuracy of using AI against the principles of medical ethics, notably patient autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Discrepancies can result in concerns with bias, inequality, transparency, and patient safety as the medical field learns and begins to integrate this new technology. This manuscript is an extension of our 2024 meeting symposium on the topic and provides a review of the current literature around the ethical challenges of AI in academic surgery. We consider accountability, consent, notification, and bias in the setting of patient care and surgical education. Our goal is to equip physicians with a clear understanding of the ethical challenges and considerations surrounding AI to help them make informed decisions about integrating the technology into their practice and careers.}

Computational thinking was measured using our newly validated Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD), while course performance was assessed based on final grades in an introductory computing course at a Southwestern institution—the first coding experience for many students. For the fall 2021 participant cohort of 163 first-year engineering and computing students, 40.9% expressed positive attitudes toward AI in their career prospects, with 48.9% of them having prior computer science course experience. Regarding their backgrounds, the number of CS courses taken before college significantly correlated with their attitudes toward AI, ECTD scores, and course grades—irrespective of gender, URM status, residence, First-Generation, or First-Time-in-College status. These findings support the notion that computational thinking privilege, shaped by prior exposure and access to resources, contributes to digital inequity and influences attitudes. Specifically, students’ cognitive attitudes toward AI have the potential to shape AI literacy and education, potentially perpetuating inequities in an increasingly AI-driven world.}

Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted prediction of hospital admission is an innovative tool that optimizes resource allocation and improves patient flow within emergency departments. Health institutions need to decongest these departments to maintain sustainability and become efficient. Increasing demand and excessive competition for limited resources directly contribute to these challenges.
Objective
This systematic review aims to evaluate the use of artificial intelligence in the prediction of hospital admissions, evaluating the accuracy of machine learning models, their impact on clinical decision- making, and their role in the optimization and allocation of resources.
Methods
A systematic review of studies published between 2019 and 2024 followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were selected based on a pre-defined Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) framework, and methodological quality was assessed using the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) and the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (ChAMAI) tools.
Results
A total of 20 studies were included; most of the studies evaluated were retrospective. AI-based models demonstrated superior accuracy (85 % to 95 %) compared to traditional methods, with Random Forest (RF) and Neural Networks outperforming classical statistical models. Studies incorporating unstructured data through Natural Language Processing (NLP) have significantly improved patient flow and resource allocation. The integration of predictive analytics resulted in a reduction in avoidable hospitalizations, optimized bed occupancy, and a decrease in emergency room overcrowding.
Conclusion
AI-driven admission prediction is promising in the hospital setting, as it improves efficiency and allows for proactive and rapid decision-making, optimizing available resources. Future research is promising and should focus on prospective studies to validate practical applicability.}

Artificial intelligence could contribute to transform cardiology through a Perception, Reasoning and Action framework. In the Perception phase, artificial intelligence can improve data acquisition. The Reasoning stage involves artificial intelligence-driven data analysis, integrating large datasets to support clinical decision-making and personalized treatment plans. In the Action phase, artificial intelligence optimizes therapeutic interventions, automates clinical workflows and enhances patient engagement. Artificial intelligence might therefore free up time for cardiologists to focus more on direct patient care and less on data acquisition and analysis, although their supervision remains essential. This review also addresses the technical and ethical challenges of artificial intelligence, including quality of datasets, algorithmic bias, the need for explainable artificial intelligence and data privacy, while exploring future perspectives, such as quantum computing and interdisciplinary collaboration.

The aviation industry is increasingly interested in adopting AI to improve efficiency, safety, and cost efficiency; with the Generative Pre-trained Transformers’ (GPT) capability to reduce resource-intensive analytics in accident causation classification. This study investigates the potential and challenges of using AI to analyze human factors involved in aviation accidents based on the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). Six subject-matter experts in aviation human factors and AI domain participated in this research. All participants were familiar with the HFACS framework to analyze aviation accident reports and the output of GPT which were based on the prompt engineering developed by the research team. This research creates a framework to perform its initial generation and training using GE 235 accident investigation report from Taiwan Transportation Safety Board (TTSB). Initial discoveries demonstrated that the AI model could populate the sub-dimensions of Level 1 HFACS framework with moderate accuracy, although there remains a high presence of hallucinations in generated outputs, with a lack of reproducibility in consecutive outputs with consistent input data. There are still different opinions on AI applications in real-world operations with ethics and safety concerns. While there is clear potential for GPT models to supplement accident analysis within the HFACS framework, there is still more work to integrate HFACS framework into GPT modelling for effective generation to accident data.}

Early detection of SAD lays the foundation for the introduction of early interventions. However, due to the nature of social avoidance in social anxiety, the screening is challenging in the clinical setting. Classic questionnaires also bear the limitations of subjectivity, memory biases under repeated measures, and cultural influence. Thus, there exists an urgent need to develop a reliable and easily accessible tool to be widely used for social anxiety screening. Here, we developed the Social Artificial Intelligence Picture System (SAIPS) based on generative multi-modal foundation artificial intelligence (AI) models, containing a total of 279 social pictures and 118 control pictures. Social scenarios were constructed to represent core SAD triggers such as fear of negative evaluation, social interactions, and performance anxiety, mapping to specific dimensions of social anxiety to capture its multifaceted nature. Pictures devoid of social interactions were included as a control, aiming to reveal response patterns specific to social scenarios and to improve the system’s precision in predicting social anxiety traits. Through laboratory and online experiments, we collected ratings on SAIPS from five dimensions. Machine learning results showed that ratings on SAIPS robustly reflected and predicted an individual’s trait of social anxiety, especially social anxiety and arousal ratings. The prediction was reliable, even based on a short version with less than 30 pictures. Together, SAIPS may serve as a promising tool to support social anxiety screening and longitudinal predictions.}

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review using the PRISMA method, covering 38 studies from 2014 to 2024 applied AI in eco-design. This is the first review to consider all life-cycle stages with eco-design practices, integrating Ellen MacArthur circularity principles, United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs), life cycle assessment (LCA), industrial applications, and AI methods. Our findings reveal: 1- an imbalanced focus across product life-cycle stages, with most studies addressing design and end-of-life, while production, use-life, and distribution remain underexplored. 2- Common eco-design practices include recycling, energy reduction, and disassembly, with less focus on non-hazardous materials, waste minimization, and remanufacturing. 3- While neural networks and hybrid AI methods are commonly applied for material compatibility and emissions prediction, more advanced AI-based approaches such as generative AI and LLMs have yet to be used in design, LCA, and circularity analysis. 4- No study applies all four Ellen MacArthur Technosphere circular economy strategies. 5- Researchers rarely couple LCA with cradle-to-cradle assessments or embed their results in real-time design simulations. 6- Case studies mostly focus on electronics and household appliances, with limited application in automotive, aviation, maritime, and healthcare. 7- SDG consideration mainly centers on SDGs 12 and 13, with more attention neededforotherSDGs.}

Traditional teaching approaches struggle to support self-directed, context-sensitive, and motivationally engaging learning experiences—skills that are critical for preparing future project leaders. In this context, there is growing interest in the potential of artificial intelligence-powered tools to enhance the quality and adaptability of educating future project managers. This paper explores the application of artificial intelligence-driven chatbots in university-level project management education through the lens of the two-year international project ”ChatLearn” conducted across four European countries. Using an action design research methodology, the project iteratively developed and tested a chatbot in three versions, progressively integrating feedback from students and educators. The study suggests that artificial intelligence-based chatbots hold significant promise for supporting personalised learning journeys and increasing student motivation; however, their integration requires careful design, ongoing dialogue within the teaching community, and a strong alignment with pedagogical objectives.}

These issues are particularly pronounced for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), who often experience distressing symptoms and struggle with educational materials due to complex jargon, fatigue, or reading level mismatches. To address these issues, we developed and assessed the feasibility of a digital health platform, CRCWeb, to improve the accessibility of educational resources on symptom management for disadvantaged patients with CRC and their caregivers facing limited health literacy or low income. CRCWeb was developed through a stakeholder-centered participatory design approach. Two-phase semistructured interviews with patients, caregivers, and oncology experts informed the iterative design process. From the interviews, we developed the following 5 key design principles: user-friendly navigation, multimedia integration, concise and clear content, enhanced accessibility for individuals with vision and reading disabilities, and scalability for future content expansion. Initial feedback from iterative stakeholder engagements confirmed high user satisfaction, with participants rating CRCWeb an average of 3.98 out of 5 on the postintervention survey. Additionally, using generative artificial intelligence tools, including large language models like ChatGPT and multimedia generation tools such as Pictory, complex health care guidelines were transformed into concise, easily comprehensible multimedia content, and made accessible through CRCWeb. User engagement was notably higher among disadvantaged participants with limited health literacy or low income, who logged into the platform 2.52 times more frequently than nondisadvantaged participants. The structured development approach of CRCWeb demonstrates that generative artificial intelligence–powered multimedia interventions can effectively address health care accessibility barriers faced by disadvantaged patients with CRC and caregivers with limited health literacy or low income. This structured approach highlights how digital innovations can enhance health care.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) will impact a large proportion of jobs in the short to medium term, especially in the developed countries. The consequences will be felt across many sectors including health care, a critical sector for implementation of AI tools because glitches in algorithms or biases in training datasets may lead to suboptimal treatment that may negatively affect the health of an individual. The stakes are obviously higher in case of potentially life-threatening diseases such as cancer and therapies with a potential for causing severe or even fatal adverse events. Over the last two decades, much of the research on AI in health care has focussed on diagnostic radiology and digital pathology, but a solid body of research is emerging on AI tools in the radiation oncology workflow. Many of these applications are relatively uncontroversial, although there is still a lack of evidence regarding effectiveness rather than efficiency, and—the ultimate bar—evidence of clinical utility. Proponents of AI will argue that these algorithms should be implemented with robust human supervision. One challenge here is the deskilling effect associated with new technologies. We will become increasingly dependent on the AI tools over time, and we will become less capable of assessing the quality of the AI output. Much of this research appears almost old-fashioned in view of the rapid advances in Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). GenAI can draw from multiple types of data and produce output that is personalised and appears relevant in the given context. Especially the rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) has opened a wide field of potential applications that were out of bounds just a few years ago. One LLM, Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), has been made widely accessible to end-users as ChatGPT-4, which passed a rigorous Turing test in a recent study. In this viewpoint, I argue for the necessity of independent academic research to establish evidence-based applications of AI in medicine. Algorithmic medicine is an intervention similar to a new drug or a new medical device. We should be especially concerned about under-represented minorities and rare/atypical clinical cases that may drown in the petabyte-sized training sets. A huge educational push is needed to ensure that the end-users of AI in health care understand the strengths and weaknesses of algorithmic medicine. Finally, we need to address the ethical boundaries for where and when GenAI can replace humans in the relation between patients and healthcare providers.}

abstract = {Objective
Personal statements (PSs) express applicants’ personal characteristics and motivations informing pursuit of a surgical career. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a revolutionary technology. There are currently no data to suggest how and to what extent AI is used in surgical residency applications. We examined the prevalence of AI use and applicant pool characteristics in PSs submitted to a surgical residency.
Design
PSs from US MD and DO applicants to an academic general surgery program were collected for both the 2022-23 and 2023-24 NRMP Match cycles. PSs were analyzed using 2 AI-detection tools: GPTZero and Copyleaks. Data were analyzed using T-test and Fisher’s Exact Test.
Setting
UMass Chan Medical School—Baystate general surgery residency program in Springfield, Massachusetts.
Participants
There were 1332 applications during 2022-23 NRMP Match cycle and 1221 for 2023-24. After excluding international medical graduates and incomplete applications, 1490 PSs were analyzed.
Results
1490 PS were included (758 [50.9%] for 2022-23; 732 [49.1%] for 2023-24). Demographic characteristics did not differ between the 2 cycles. GPTZero identified AI use in 77 (10.2%) PSs in 2022-23 and 268 (36.6%) in 2023-24 (p < 0.001). Copyleaks identified AI use in 20 (2.6%) PSs in 2022-23 and 165 (22.5%) in 2023-24 (p < 0.001). Concordance in AI detection with both tools was observed in 13 (1.7% of total PSs) for 2022-23 and 155 (21.2%) for 2023-24 (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis of concordance in 2023-24 showed increased non-English native language characteristics (38.7% vs 19.6%; p < 0.001), a lower average personal statement word count (597.3 vs 645.9; p < 0.001) and shorter average sentence (10.0 vs 10.4 words; p < 0.001) in the AI group.

abstract = {The study explored how Arab academic libraries are adopting artificial intelligence (AI) and examined the awareness of AI ethical considerations from the perspectives of Arab academic librarians. It utilized a survey-based approach, employing a snowball sampling technique across 48 academic libraries in 17 Arab countries. The research instrument was a web-based questionnaire, which received responses from a total of 272 participants. The findings revealed that 37.5 % of respondents indicated that their libraries use AI, with cataloging and generating metadata being the most common applications used by 43 % of libraries. The study highlighted several challenges to AI adoption in Arab academic libraries, including a lack of necessary infrastructure and staff training. Moreover, about 81 % of Arab academic librarians believed that intellectual property and copyright are the most important ethical considerations regarding AI. However, only 12% of participants reported having encountered ethical issues related to AI use in their library work. The results indicated that the primary actions taken by Arab academic libraries were offering face-to-face or online seminars and workshops on AI ethics, as well as providing ethical considerations and resources related to academic integrity through their websites. The study recommended that Arab academic libraries organize appropriate training programs to improve AI literacy among staff, develop the necessary infrastructure for AI adoption, and prepare relevant policy documents to guide the ethical use of AI technologies.}

This prospective exploratory study included 20 adults who visited their first outpatient clinic due to hepatobiliary or pancreatic conditions. Consultations were audio-recorded, transcribed using Whisper-1 (OpenAI), and converted into structured Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP) clinical notes using ChatGPT 3.5 (OpenAI), implemented through Python 3.11.6. The transcriptions were manually reviewed against gold-standard references, and the ASR performance was quantified using standard metrics from the Jiwer library. Descriptive statistics were computed, and the ChatGPT note quality was evaluated using a standardized checklist, before assessing for statistical significance. The median patient age was 47 years (65 % female). The average interview duration was 15.98 min. Whisper transcribed audio in a median of 59.3 s, and ChatGPT generated SOAP notes in 5.7 s. ChatGPT produced satisfactory results in 85 % of cases, with a significant performance. The ASR system demonstrated acceptable transcription quality. The integration of Whisper and ChatGPT drastically reduced the documentation time compared with manual electronic health record (EHR) entry. Despite some limitations, these results highlight the promise of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered documentation tools in outpatient practice. Further research with larger samples and direct comparisons with traditional methods is warranted to confirm these findings and address the ethical, legal, and implementation challenges associated with AI in clinical environments.}

abstract = {Objective
To assess the ability of humans to differentiate human-authored vs artificial intelligence (AI)–generated medical manuscripts.
Methods
This is a prospective randomized survey study from October 1, 2023, to December 1, 2023, from a single academic center. Artificial intelligence–generated medical manuscripts were created using ChatGPT 3.5 and were evaluated alongside randomly selected human-authored manuscripts. Participants, who were blinded from manuscript selection and creation, were randomized to receive three manuscripts that were either human-authored or AI-generated and had to fill out a survey questionnaire after review regarding who authored the manuscript. The primary outcome was accuracy of human reviewers in differentiating manuscript authors. Secondary outcomes were to identify factors that influenced prediction accuracy.
Results
Fifty-one physicians were included in the study, including 12 post-doctorates, 19 assistant professors, and 20 associate or full professors. The overall specificity of 55.6% (95% CI, 30.8% to 78.5%), sensitivity of 31.2% (95% CI,11.0% to 58.7%), positive predictive value of 38.5% (95% CI,13.9% to 68.4%) and negative predictive value of 47.6% (95% CI, 25.7% to 70.2%). A stratified analysis of human-authored manuscripts indicated that high-impact factor manuscripts were identified with higher accuracy than low-impact factor ones (P=.037). For individual-level data, neither academic rank nor prior manuscript review experience significantly predicted the accuracy. The frequency of AI interaction was a significant factor, with occasional (odds ratio [OR], 8.20; P=.016), fairly frequent (OR, 7.13; P=.033), and very frequent (OR, 8.36; P=.030) use associated with correct identification. Further analysis revealed no significant predictors among the papers' qualities.
Conclusion
Generative AI such as ChatGPT could create medical manuscripts that could not be differentiated from human-authored manuscripts.}

The tools we highlight aim to accelerate imaging acquisition, reduce cognitive and manual burden on radiologists and others involved in the care pathway, improve diagnostic accuracy, and shorten the time to clinical action based on imaging results. Most existing studies have focused on intermediate outcomes, such as task duration or time to the next step in care. In this article, we present an examination of AI applications across the medical imaging exam workflow, review examples of real-world evidence on these tools, and summarize the relevant performance metrics by application type. Beyond the more immediately acquired measures, to demonstrate benefit to patient health and economic outcomes, a more integrated assessment is necessary, and in an iterative fashion. To evolve beyond early workflow gains, interoperable tools must be tied to measurable downstream impacts, such as reduced disease severity, lower mortality, and shorter hospital stays, while we acknowledge that current empirical evaluations are limited.}

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an intractable problem that has the potential to significantly limit advances in human health. Recently, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) High-Level Statement on AMR defined targets for addressing the impact of resistance on human, animal, and environmental health. For human health, the discovery and development of new antibiotics, antimicrobial stewardship programmes, antimicrobial surveillance, and infection control and prevention are all key areas. Artificial intelligence (AI) is ideally placed to help achieve the UNGA targets via its role in revealing patterns in data that are clinically indiscernible, and using that information to build clinical decision support systems. However, significant barriers remain in terms of necessary infrastructure, know-how, and the implementation of AI approaches. In this Series paper, we consider the potential applications of AI in combatting the AMR problem through drug discovery and development, antimicrobial stewardship, diagnostics, and surveillance, and their use in public health. We then discuss the technical, infrastructure, regulatory, ethical, and policy challenges that affect these domains.}

abstract = {Objectives
With the escalating global burden of cancer, there is an increasing imperative to adopt holistic, person-centered approaches that address the complex and evolving care needs of individuals across the cancer continuum. Integrating advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) into conventional cancer care models offers significant potential to enhance the responsiveness, inclusivity, and sustainability of cancer care delivery. This paper aimed to explore how the Caring Life Course Theory (CLCT), a comprehensive multidisciplinary framework of care, can inform and enhance the integration of AI into cancer care delivery.
Methods
A conceptual synthesis and narrative synthesis were employed to explore and understand how CLCT constructs can inform AI applications across different levels of cancer care (individual, relational/network and structural).
Results
AI technologies are being used to support personalized care planning, real-time symptom monitoring, survivorship management, and coordinated service delivery. Guided by the CLCT, these technologies offer a structured and contextually grounded approach to delivering longitudinal, life-course-informed care. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain, including ethical concerns, algorithmic bias, and implementation barriers.
Conclusions
Aligning AI technologies with the CLCT framework can promote more personalized, equitable, and relationally responsive cancer care. Future research must prioritize ethical co-design, accountability, and sustained implementation.
Implications for Nursing Practice
: The integration of CLCT and AI can support nurses in identifying care needs, facilitating remote monitoring, and coordinating personalized care. However, the integration of AI must be approached with critical attention to ethics, equity, and the preservation of fundamental nursing values.}

AI systems, particularly those employing machine and deep learning, excel in processing large datasets and comparing images from similar contexts, fulfilling radiological demands. However, the implementation of AI in radiology presents notable challenges, including concerns about data privacy, informed consent, and the potential for external interferences affecting decision-making processes. Biases represent another critical issue, often stemming from unrepresentative datasets or inadequate system training, which can lead to distorted outcomes and exacerbate healthcare inequalities. Additionally, generative AI systems may produce ‘hallucinations’ arising from their reliance on probabilistic modeling without the ability to distinguish between true and false information. Such risks raise ethical and legal questions, especially when AI-induced errors harm patient health. Concerning liability for medical errors involving AI, healthcare professionals currently retain full accountability for their decisions. AI systems remain tools to support, not replace, human expertise and judgment. Nevertheless, the “black box” nature of many AI models – wherein the reasoning behind outputs remains opaque – limits the possibility of fully informed consent. We advocate for prioritizing Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in radiology. While potentially less performant than black-box models, XAI enhances transparency, allowing patients to understand how their data is used and how AI influences clinical decisions, aligning with ethical standards.}

abstract = {Background
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into hip and knee surgery has been evolving rapidly, with significant implications for diagnostics, surgical planning, and outcome prediction. However, there has been limited literature with comprehensive overview of AI in arthroplasty surgery. This bibliometric analysis aims to identify the 50 most cited articles on AI in hip and knee surgery, highlighting key contributors, research trends, and methodological patterns.
Hypothesis
We hypothesized that AI has generated a growing body of influential research in hip and knee surgery, with specific trends in applications, geographic distribution, and methodological approaches.
Material and methods
A systematic search was performed in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) on July 14, 2025, using predefined keywords related to AI and hip/knee surgery. Original research articles were screened and ranked by citation count. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze bibliometric variables including authorship, journal impact factor, country of origin, and AI techniques.
Results
The 50 most cited articles, published between 2016 and 2023, accumulated a total of 7,140 citations (mean: 142.8; range: 59–735). The most cited article received 735 citations. The United States was the most prolific contributor, accounting for 27 articles (54.0%) and 2,772 citations (38.8%). Deep learning was the most frequently used AI technique (29 articles, 58% of articles). Knee-related topics were predominant, addressed in 32 articles (64.0%) while hip-related studies represented 18 articles (36.0%). Thematic focus was predominantly diagnostic with 31 articles (62.0%) centered on radiographic interpretation. There was no significant correlation between journal impact factor and citation count (Pearson’s r = 0.21; p = 0.28).
Discussion
This bibliometric analysis outlines the foundational literature driving AI adoption in hip and knee surgery. While the field is rapidly expanding, research remains unevenly distributed, with limited focus on hip surgery and treatment-oriented AI. Future studies should emphasize clinical validation, generalizability, and the integration of explainable AI into orthopedic practice.
