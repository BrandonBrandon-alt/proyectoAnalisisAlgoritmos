abstract = {Artificial intelligence in medical imaging has grown rapidly in the past decade, driven by advances in deep learning and widespread access to computing resources. Applications cover diverse imaging modalities, including those based on electromagnetic radiation (e.g., X-rays), subatomic particles (e.g., nuclear imaging), and acoustic waves (ultrasound). Each modality features and limitations are defined by its underlying physics. However, many artificial intelligence practitioners lack a solid understanding of the physical principles involved in medical image acquisition. This gap hinders leveraging the full potential of deep learning, as incorporating physics knowledge into artificial intelligence systems promotes trustworthiness, especially in limited data scenarios. This work reviews the fundamental physical concepts behind medical imaging and examines their influence on recent developments in artificial intelligence, particularly, generative models and reconstruction algorithms. Finally, we describe physics-informed machine learning approaches to improve feature learning in medical imaging.}

abstract = {Background
There is ample evidence that the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools into nursing practice is becoming more commonplace, but there are fewer national resources indicating to what degree prelicensure nursing programs employ these technologies and incorporate related topics into their curriculum.
Purpose
The current survey study sought to determine the prevalence of registered nurse (RN) and licensed practical nurse (LPN) education programs’ use of generative AI technologies, and the extent to which they embed AI and other digital health topics into their instructional content.
Methods
A national survey was conducted of all RN and LPN program administrators nationwide for which we had email contact information (N = 2744).
Results
Prelicensure RN programs (n = 122, 24 %) were more likely to use generative AI technology than LPN programs (n = 27, 12 %, p < 0.001), but more than three-quarters of both types of programs reported they do not use such tools or are not sure. In addition to the low usage of generative AI technology, few programs reported teaching advancements in AI and/or other digital health–related topics to their students (RN n = 87, 17 %; LPN n = 25, 11 %).
Conclusion
Nursing education programs that limit integration of AI into their curriculum risk potentially limiting students’ learning on evidence-based practice and may miss opportunities to promote critical reflection. The results of our study underscore the need to support nursing faculty to ensure prelicensure instructional content prepares nursing students for advancements in clinical practice.}

abstract = {Introduction Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA), with etiologies ranging from benign to life-threatening, necessitates rapid and accurate diagnosis, particularly for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), to initiate timely plasmapheresis preventing severe outcomes. Diagnosing TTP is challenging due to overlapping clinical features with other causes of TMA, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), compounded by that specific diagnostic tests such as biopsies or ADAMTS13 activity assays do not result immediately. This study explored GPT-4's capability in suggesting differential diagnoses for TMA patients and identifying a provisional diagnosis of TTP based on clinical presentation and basic diagnostic workup to determine the need for prompt plasmapheresis, assessing its potential as a diagnostic support tool. Method We utilized open-access case reports from PubMed Central that provided a comprehensive list of cases with diagnosis of TMA. The exclusion criteria included cases with no access, copyright permission issues, preprints, insufficient description, non-case reports, non-English language, and no established diagnosis for TMA. Each case input including only the history and physical examination (H&P) and basic diagnostic workup excluding the confirmatory diagnosis was presented to GPT-4 in three separate trials and was prompted to provide clinical reasoning that both favored or rejected the diagnosis of TTP, create a top three differential diagnoses list selected from a comprehensive list of TMA diagnoses, and determine the necessity of plasmapheresis. Generated results were subsequently compared with the confirmed case diagnosis and management provided within the case report. Result An initial PubMed Central search identified 424 cases; 326 were excluded, resulting in 98 eligible cases. The top three differential diagnoses generated for each case in all three trials exhibited relatively higher F1-scores for ITP, TTP, HUS, and HELLP syndrome, with values of 0.58, 0.59, 0.53, and 0.7, respectively. Other causes of TMA scored below 0.5. Overall performance metrics indicated a specificity of 0.85, sensitivity of 0.80, precision of 0.28, and an F1-score of 0.42. When grouped into TTP versus non-TTP cases, the sensitivity was notably high at 0.98, showing that GPT-4 could adequately rule out TTP, although the specificity was 0.76. When comparing the case diagnosis with the primary diagnosis within the top three differential diagnoses, the overall specificity was 0.96, sensitivity was 0.56, precision was 0.58, and the F1-score was 0.57. The match rate of GPT-4 suggesting plasmapheresis compared to the case report was 76%. In cases confirmed as TTP, GPT-4 demonstrated 100% accuracy in recommending plasmapheresis. For non-TTP cases, GPT-4 showed a 66% match rate compared to the case report's decision to initiate plasmapheresis, indicating a 34% reduction in suggesting plasmapheresis for these cases. Error analysis revealed that errors were primarily due to GPT-4 ignoring pertinent findings, inaccurate knowledge, and confounding symptoms or findings within the case report itself. Discussion This study demonstrated that GPT-4 could adequately assist in the diagnosis of TMA and provide suggestions for early management of TTP based on clinical presentation and basic diagnostic workup. GPT-4 appropriately recommended plasmapheresis for TTP cases and showed a comparable performance of that of a clinically commonly used tool in these settings, PLASMIC score. However, in our study, GPT-4 made errors such as ignoring pertinent findings and demonstrating incomplete knowledge, highlighting the need for pretraining and areas to improve regarding diagnosis of TMA. The study suggested that GPT-4 could be integrated as a diagnostic support tool, especially for complex, time-sensitive conditions, while emphasizing that it should complement, not replace, clinical judgment.}

abstract = {The public launch of generative AI systems in 2022 has prompted considerable popular interest in their potential to transform work and to achieve the long-sought goal of machine intelligence. While the uncanny abilities of Large Language Models to produce fluent text on almost any subject lends these ideas some plausibility, they are based on debatable, if not erroneous, claims about the capabilities of generative AI. Although rarely presented in these terms, these claims may be seen to reflect a limited, substantive conception of the agency of AI systems. Alternative conceptualisations of agency from other disciplines are presented that may offer potentially more fruitful ways of thinking about agency in relation to AI. The way that conceptions of the agency of AI systems is shaped by the language used to describe their behaviour is highlighted and opportunities for alternative conceptions of agency to inform a more critical analysis of generative AI are identified.}

This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard.}

Background: Despite the numerous benefits to including OEQs in assessment of medical knowledge1,2, only 39% of US allopathic medical schools use them3. Faculty report that the biggest barrier is the time it takes to grade student responses1,2. Natural language processing has been explored to automate scoring of clinical reasoning4, but no study has evaluated the use of generative AI to score OEQ responses in the pre-clerkship curriculum. Methods: OEQ responses from two questions administered at the Zucker School of Medicine (ZSOM) and the University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine (UCSF) were used for the current study5. Responses from 54 students per site were analyzed. Content experts scored the responses using an analytic (ZSOM) or holistic rubric (UCSF). Questions, rubrics, and student responses were fed into the GPT-4 model via the Med2Lab platform. Once finalized, scores for each student’s response were generated. Cohen’s weighted kappa (kw) was used to evaluate inter-rater reliability (IRR) between the content expert and generative AI scores, with kw scores between 0.60 and 0.80 being considered substantial6. Prompt engineering was employed for question 1 (analytic rubric) to evaluate its impact on IRR. Results: IRR between the content expert and generative AI scores was substantial using the analytic rubric (question 1: kw = 0.71; question 2: kw = 0.63) and the holistic rubric (question 1: kw = 0.66; question 2: kw = 0.68). IRR for question 1 (analytic rubric) was initially kw = 0.61 but was increased to kw = 0.71 after adjustments with prompt engineering and re-run in GPT-4. Conclusions: Generative AI can score OEQs with substantial reliability. With the potential to alleviate grading burden, AI scoring will allow medical schools to broadly implement OEQs for assessment.}

Effective integration of artificial intelligence-based tools into nursing care and science will depend on aligned integration in nursing education. Our quality improvement study documents the process and short-term outcomes of introducing a generative AI-based tool into a nursing education system. Nursing school faculty and staff at one private, southeastern university (n = 364) piloted an internally constrained chatbot system for 2 months in 2024. Data were captured to evaluate the (a) costs of implementation, (b) use cases in nursing education, and (c) projected system impact. Costs were lower than $2 per month, per user. There were 148 diverse case reports from 35 unique users. On a separate survey, 35 respondents rated technology acceptability as 5.2/7.0. Projected impact is high (6.3/7.0), but not entirely positive (5.9/7.0). Benefits and challenges were identified. Nursing will need to invest expert time and community resources to evolve education systems along with these evolving technologies.}

Despite the risks associated with generative AI (GenAI) chatbots, people increasingly use these technologies, which may seem contradictory. This study identified and explored factors and risks related to trust, perceived values, satisfaction, and sustainable use of GenAI chatbots. Relying on IS theories to build a stimulus-organism-response model, the authors tested a model using PLS-SEM with data from 393 ChatGPT users. The results show that user competence and autonomy dramatically increase a user's trust in ChatGPT, and trust improves hedonic value (HV), utilitarian value (UV), value-in-use, perceived task-technology fit (TTF), information accuracy, knowledge acquisition, perceived informativeness, and user satisfaction. In addition to trust, user satisfaction depends on HV, UV, and TTF. The sustainability use of ChatGPT depends on HV and satisfaction. However, perceived privacy concerns, perceived privacy risks, and privacy awareness do not affect consumer trust. There is a complete mediation between trust and sustainability, as well as HV and sustainability.}

We enthusiastically endorse these recommendations, but we offer (a) a caveat and (b) solutions that are not at not new in principle but which we propose can be accomplished with surprisingly novel approaches. In this chapter, we offer a brief outline of ACTr in ABA, caveats to using ACTr, and strategies for training BCBAs to the level of competence and sensitivity to scope of practice required. Specifically, we introduce the concept of programmed instruction in ACTr using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and provide examples of GenAI as it is used in medical research. Finally, we offer a list of recommendations to researchers and practitioners interested in pursuing this approach to realizing Skinner’s dream.}

In contrast to many existing artificial intelligence models, generative pretrained transformer models can perform with very limited training data. Generative pretrained transformer 3 (GPT-3) is one of the latest releases in this pipeline, demonstrating human-like logical and intellectual responses to prompts. Some examples include writing essays, answering complex questions, matching pronouns to their nouns, and conducting sentiment analyses. However, questions remain with regard to its implementation in health care, specifically in terms of operationalization and its use in clinical practice and research. In this viewpoint paper, we briefly introduce GPT-3 and its capabilities and outline considerations for its implementation and operationalization in clinical practice through a use case. The implementation considerations include (1) processing needs and information systems infrastructure, (2) operating costs, (3) model biases, and (4) evaluation metrics. In addition, we outline the following three major operational factors that drive the adoption of GPT-3 in the US health care system: (1) ensuring Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance, (2) building trust with health care providers, and (3) establishing broader access to the GPT-3 tools. This viewpoint can inform health care practitioners, developers, clinicians, and decision makers toward understanding the use of the powerful artificial intelligence tools integrated into hospital systems and health care.}

This oral presentation proposes to explain the current state of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in health care and education. We will also showcase a research project that used GAI to create radiographic images and another ongoing project exploring the potential of GAI in dental education and research.
Study Design
Research 1—A pilot study was conducted to enhance ultra-low dose cone beam computed tomographic images of dry skulls to diagnostically acceptable standards. The images were trained using a pix2pix deep generative model. Research 2—A pilot study is being conducted exploring the accuracy of case reports generated by ChatGPT. We queried ChatGPT to create hypothetical case reports and modified the queries to get the best possible output.
Results
Research 1—Preliminary results indicated that the synthesized images are comparable with images made with normal exposure. Research 2—Preliminary results indicate that ChatGPT can create a convincing and accurate case report. Limitations in use of citations were observed.
Conclusion
GAI like Open AI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard, and Microsoft's CoPilot have caused a massive shift in public knowledge of AI. GAI will have major impact in health care and education. GAI tools like ChatGPT have huge potential for use and misuse in educational and research spheres. Creating questions and explanation on complex topics can be done on these tools. Websites like MidJourney can create interesting and novel images. Radiographic images can be created using specific algorithms. We intend to demonstrate how to effectively use GAI like ChatGPT, describe ethical concerns and how to address and regulate them in academia, and identify innovative uses for AI and ChatGPT in dental care and education. GAI is a freight train with no breaks and as educators and healthcare practitioners we need to discuss and propose policies and safeguards for responsible use of AI.}

Can generative AI models provide reliable counselling to fertility patients regarding real-world clinical questions.
Design
In this cross-sectional study, 12 clinical questions were developed to reflect common, real-life dilemmas encountered during fertility workup and treatment. Responses to each question were generated by two experienced fertility specialists, ChatGPT, and Gemini. Eight leading internationally recognized fertility experts, blinded to the source of each reply, independently rated all responses on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 10 (strongly agree). Ratings were compared across all four repliers using non-parametric statistical tests.
Results
Replies authored by physicians received significantly higher overall scores than those generated by AI models (p<0.001). Median scores were highest for Doctor A (9.0), followed by Doctor B (8.0), then ChatGPT (7.0), and finally Gemini received the lowest score (4.5). The proportion of high-scoring responses (≥8) was greatest for Doctor A (70.8%), followed by Doctor B (56.3%), then ChatGPT (47.9%), and finally Gemini (35.4%) (p<0.001).
Conclusion
Experienced fertility specialists outperformed generative AI models in providing accurate responses to complex clinical questions. Despite the growing accessibility and sophistication of AI tools, their use for individualized fertility counseling remains limited. Continued refinement and clinical validation of AI tools are essential before they can be considered reliable for patient-specific guidance. At present, AI should be viewed as a complementary resource rather than a substitute for expert clinical judgment.}

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) presents new opportunities to improve clinical decision-making and operational effectiveness in this field. This structured narrative review identified and evaluated studies applying AI and ML in transfusion medicine. A search of PubMed and Scopus for articles published between January 2018 and April 2025 yielded 565 publications. Studies were included if they applied AI or ML techniques, focused on transfusion management or decision support, and were evaluated using electronic health records or expert review. Four exemplar studies were selected, each representing a distinct AI paradigm: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and generative learning. These studies were critically appraised for methodological rigor, clinical relevance, and potential for implementation in practice. The reviewed studies reflected a clear shift from traditional analytic methods toward more advanced computational approaches to improve prediction accuracy, optimize resource allocation, and support clinical decision-making. Three overarching themes emerged: the need to balance model complexity with interpretability and clinical feasibility; the impact of data quality and preprocessing on model performance and fairness; and the barriers to broader applicability and cross-institutional deployment. As technological barriers continue to decline, future challenges will increasingly center on privacy regulations, infrastructure constraints, and aligning model complexity with practical utility. Thoughtful integration of these considerations through scalable, clinical-grade, and transparent solutions will be critical in realizing the full potential of AI and ML in transfusion medicine.}

Designing new products and artifacts is one of the many fields where it is very difficult to enable computing machines replicate human creativity and innovativeness. Design processes in engineering fields as well as in arts follow methodical series of steps to create new products. Due to high demands of customized products and services, competitors tend to shorten the time-to-market periods, using advanced Computer-Aided Design programs. These programs play important roles to assist designers in digitizing blueprints and automating repetitive tasks. However, they fail to boost designer creativity by generating or suggesting new ideas or designs based on existing products or their variants. In order to boost creativity in the entertainment industry, we propose in this paper a new approach based on unsupervised learning techniques to create variants of a given artifact or product blueprints. Within the field of designing new cartoon characters, our proposed approach relies on Generative Adversarial Neural Networks [1] to create new anime or cartoon faces on their own without any human intervention. It learns features and characteristics from an image training dataset and combines them to create new features and thus builds a new image which is not present in the training dataset. This applied approach attempts to not only help artists and designers to have a preview of the possible new and unique avatars but also would prevent any copyright infringements.}

abstract = {Background
Research on the diagnosis of COVID-19 using lung images is limited by the scarcity of imaging data. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are popular for synthesis and data augmentation. GANs have been explored for data augmentation to enhance the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for the diagnosis of COVID-19 within lung computed tomography (CT) and X-ray images. However, the role of GANs in overcoming data scarcity for COVID-19 is not well understood.
Objective
This review presents a comprehensive study on the role of GANs in addressing the challenges related to COVID-19 data scarcity and diagnosis. It is the first review that summarizes different GAN methods and lung imaging data sets for COVID-19. It attempts to answer the questions related to applications of GANs, popular GAN architectures, frequently used image modalities, and the availability of source code.
Methods
A search was conducted on 5 databases, namely PubMed, IEEEXplore, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The search was conducted from October 11-13, 2021. The search was conducted using intervention keywords, such as “generative adversarial networks” and “GANs,” and application keywords, such as “COVID-19” and “coronavirus.” The review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines for systematic and scoping reviews. Only those studies were included that reported GAN-based methods for analyzing chest X-ray images, chest CT images, and chest ultrasound images. Any studies that used deep learning methods but did not use GANs were excluded. No restrictions were imposed on the country of publication, study design, or outcomes. Only those studies that were in English and were published from 2020 to 2022 were included. No studies before 2020 were included.
Results
This review included 57 full-text studies that reported the use of GANs for different applications in COVID-19 lung imaging data. Most of the studies (n=42, 74%) used GANs for data augmentation to enhance the performance of AI techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. Other popular applications of GANs were segmentation of lungs and superresolution of lung images. The cycleGAN and the conditional GAN were the most commonly used architectures, used in 9 studies each. In addition, 29 (51%) studies used chest X-ray images, while 21 (37%) studies used CT images for the training of GANs. For the majority of the studies (n=47, 82%), the experiments were conducted and results were reported using publicly available data. A secondary evaluation of the results by radiologists/clinicians was reported by only 2 (4%) studies.
Conclusions
Studies have shown that GANs have great potential to address the data scarcity challenge for lung images in COVID-19. Data synthesized with GANs have been helpful to improve the training of the convolutional neural network (CNN) models trained for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, GANs have also contributed to enhancing the CNNs’ performance through the superresolution of the images and segmentation. This review also identified key limitations of the potential transformation of GAN-based methods in clinical applications.}

abstract = {Purpose
The 2021 edition of the Artificial Intelligence Data Challenge was organized by the French Society of Radiology together with the Centre National d’Études Spatiales and CentraleSupélec with the aim to implement generative adversarial networks (GANs) techniques to provide 1000 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cases of macrotrabecular-massive (MTM) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a rare and aggressive subtype of HCC, generated from a limited number of real cases from multiple French centers.
Materials and methods
A dedicated platform was used by the seven inclusion centers to securely upload their anonymized MRI examinations including all three cross-sectional images (one late arterial and one portal-venous phase T1-weighted images and one fat-saturated T2-weighted image) in compliance with general data protection regulation. The quality of the database was checked by experts and manual delineation of the lesions was performed by the expert radiologists involved in each center. Multidisciplinary teams competed between October 11th, 2021 and February 13th, 2022.
Results
A total of 91 MTM-HCC datasets of three images each were collected from seven French academic centers. Six teams with a total of 28 individuals participated in this challenge. Each participating team was asked to generate one thousand 3-image cases. The qualitative evaluation was performed by three radiologists using the Likert scale on ten randomly selected cases generated by each participant. A quantitative evaluation was also performed using two metrics, the Frechet inception distance and a leave-one-out accuracy of a 1-Nearest Neighbor algorithm.
Conclusion
This data challenge demonstrates the ability of GANs techniques to generate a large number of images from a small sample of imaging examinations of a rare malignant tumor.}

abstract = {Summary
Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, hold promise for transforming medical education and physician training in response to increasing health-care demands and shortages in the global health-care workforce. Meanwhile, challenges remain in the effective and equitable integration of AI technology into medical education and physician training worldwide. This Viewpoint explores the opportunities and challenges of such an integration. We study the evolving role of AI in medical education, its potential to enhance high-fidelity clinical training, and its contribution to research training using real-world examples. We also highlight ethical concerns, particularly the unclear boundaries of appropriate use of AI and call for clear guidelines to govern the integration of AI into medical education and physician training. Furthermore, this Viewpoint discusses practical constraints, including human, financial, and resource constraints, in AI integration, and emphasises the need for comprehensive cost evaluations and collaborative funding models to support the sustainable implementation of AI integration. A tight collaborative network between health-care institutions and systems, medical schools and universities, industry partners, and education and health-care regulatory agencies could lead to an AI-transformed medical education and physician training scheme that ultimately supports the adoption and integration of AI into clinical medicine and potentially brings about tangible improvements in global health-care delivery.}

abstract = {Background
Resident training programs in the US use the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE) developed by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) to assess the current knowledge of their residents and to identify the residents at risk of failing the Amerian Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) examination. Optimal strategies for OITE preparation are constantly being explored. There may be a role for Large Language Models (LLMs) in orthopaedic resident education. ChatGPT, an LLM launched in late 2022 has demonstrated the ability to produce accurate, detailed answers, potentially enabling it to aid in medical education and clinical decision-making. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on Orthopaedic In-Training Examinations using Self-Assessment Exams from the AAOS database and approved literature as a proxy for the Orthopaedic Board Examination.
Methods
301 SAE questions from the AAOS database and associated AAOS literature were input into ChatGPT's interface in a question and multiple-choice format and the answers were then analyzed to determine which answer choice was selected. A new chat was used for every question. All answers were recorded, categorized, and compared to the answer given by the OITE and SAE exams, noting whether the answer was right or wrong.
Results
Of the 301 questions asked, ChatGPT was able to correctly answer 183 (60.8%) of them. The subjects with the highest percentage of correct questions were basic science (81%), oncology (72.7%, shoulder and elbow (71.9%), and sports (71.4%). The questions were further subdivided into 3 groups: those about management, diagnosis, or knowledge recall. There were 86 management questions and 47 were correct (54.7%), 45 diagnosis questions with 32 correct (71.7%), and 168 knowledge recall questions with 102 correct (60.7%).
Conclusions
ChatGPT has the potential to provide orthopedic educators and trainees with accurate clinical conclusions for the majority of board-style questions, although its reasoning should be carefully analyzed for accuracy and clinical validity. As such, its usefulness in a clinical educational context is currently limited but rapidly evolving.
Clinical relevance
ChatGPT can access a multitude of medical data and may help provide accurate answers to clinical questions.}

As a proof of concept, we proposed prompt engineering for a GPT-4 workflow pipeline to extract knowledge from 176 publications on two oleaginous yeasts (Yarrowia lipolytica and Rhodosporidium toruloides). After human intervention, the pipeline obtained a total of 2037 data instances. The structured data sets and feature selections enabled ML approaches (e.g., a random forest model) to predict Yarrowia fermentation titers with decent accuracy (R 2 of 0.86 for unseen test data). Via transfer learning, the trained model could assess the production potential of the engineered nonconventional yeast, R. toruloides, for which there are fewer published reports. This work demonstrated the potential of generative artificial intelligence to streamline information extraction from research articles, thereby facilitating fermentation predictions and biomanufacturing development.

abstract = {Aim
This study investigates the impact of generative artificial intelligence literacy (GAIL) on self-directed learning skills (SDL) among nursing and midwifery students. Additionally, it examines whether general attitudes toward artificial intelligence (GAAI) mediate this relationship.
Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to support the development of clinical decision-making and problem-solving skills in nursing and midwifery education, particularly by enhancing students’ self-directed learning abilities.
Methods
A cross-sectional, descriptive and correlational study design was used. The study was conducted in three universities in Türkiye between January and February 2025. 656 nursing and midwifery students participated, selected through cluster sampling. Data were collected using the GAIL, GAAI and SDL scales. The survey form included descriptive questions regarding participants' socio-demographic characteristics and AI usage patterns. Structural equation modeling was conducted to analyze direct and indirect relationships among variables.
Results
A significant positive effect of GAILS on GAAIS was found (β = 0.75, p < .01). GAILS also had a direct and significant effect on SDLS (β = 0.60, p < .01). However, GAAIS did not mediate the relationship between GAILS and SDLS (β = 0.02, p > .05).
Conclusions
AI literacy significantly enhances SDL in nursing and midwifery students. However, positive attitudes toward AI do not independently foster SDL, highlighting the need for structured AI education in healthcare curricula. Future studies should explore long-term AI literacy interventions to assess their impact on academic outcomes and their potential contributions to clinical reasoning and decision-making skills.}

abstract = {Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited condition that reduces life expectancy and has a profound impact on quality of life. Assessment of social media conversations in the SCD community in the UK highlighted health inequities, including issues with access to emergency care, low levels of healthcare professional empathy, and racial bias/stigmatization (Shastri O, et al. ASH 2023; abstract 1057). This emphasizes the urgent unmet need for additional education. Use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to facilitate the development of medical content, including plain language summaries (PLS) of research may increase efficiency, reduce resource cost and ultimately improve accessibility to educational information across a range of audiences. We assessed the ability of GenAI to develop a PLS of our social media listening study. Methods: We developed 3 written versions of a PLS of this study: human-written by a medical writer, AI-generated, and hybrid AI-human, where a person living with SCD edited the AI version for readability. Each was ~300-400 words and with a target reading age of 12 years. The AI PLS was developed using Pfizer's GenAI tool, MAIA (Medical AI assistant). A video version of each written PLS was developed using the AI tool, Synthesia. People with SCD and their carers (≥18 years of age) were recruited via telephone to complete an online survey to assess the understandability of the 3 written PLS and preference for written versus video PLS. Participants were presented with 1 of the 3 written PLS at random and asked to assess how easily they understood it on a 5-point scale (1=very difficult; 2=difficult; 3=neither difficult nor easy; 4=easy; 5=very easy). They were then asked 3 multiple-choice questions to gauge their understanding. Participants then rated the other 2 written PLS and were asked to rank all 3 in order of most easily understood. Finally, participants watched the video version of their top-rated written PLS and stated which format they preferred. Participants were blinded to PLS source. The Flesch-Kincaid calculator (https://goodcalculators.com/flesch-kincaid-calculator/) was used to provide an objective measure of readability for each PLS. Results: Of 93 participants, there were 88 living with SCD and 5 caring for someone with SCD. The AI versions of the PLS achieved similar scores for understandability to the human-written version: mean ± standard deviation understandability scores were 4.1 ± 0.9 (human), 4.0 ± 0.9 (AI), and 3.9 ± 0.8 (AI-hybrid). Overall, 81% of participants identified the human PLS as easy or very easy to read, similar to 76% for the AI PLS, and 74% for the AI-hybrid PLS. Overall, 41 participants (44%) ranked the human PLS in first place for understandability, 31 (33%) the AI PLS, and 21 (23%) the AI-hybrid PLS. For the multiple-choice questions, results were similar regardless of which PLS participants saw first, with over 85% correctly identifying the main findings of the study and the conclusions of the author; however, 63% incorrectly thought the data on which the PLS was based were obtained from interviewing people affected by SCD rather than social media listening. Fifty-four participants (58%) preferred the video PLS over the written PLS, 27 participants (29%) preferred the written PLS and 12 (13%) had no preference. Flesch-Kincaid scores for the three PLS were as follows: human (reading ease score, 62; reading level, 8th to 9th grade); AI (reading ease score, 58; reading level, 10th to 12th grade); AI-hybrid (reading ease score, 63; reading level, 8th to 9th grade). Conclusion: There is a clear need for additional resources and education in SCD, which may be supported by the development of PLS. The limited studies that have assessed the capabilities of AI to generate PLS to date have focussed on clinical research. We have now expanded this to assess use of AI to develop PLS from a social media listening study that evaluated real-world experiences of the UK SCD community. Our study suggests that GenAI can generate PLS that are as informative as conventional, human-written PLS, and achieve similar readability scores as judged by people living with SCD in the UK (mean 4.1 for human-written, 4.0 for AI and 3.9 for AI-hybrid). We propose that GenAI may offer an alternative to conventional human-written PLS, providing a time- and resource-efficient solution to increase accessibility to educational resources.}

Although the diagnostic accuracy of LLMs in forming differential diagnoses has been reviewed in general internal medicine applications, much is unknown in autoinflammatory disorders. From the nature of autoinflammatory diseases, forming a differential diagnosis is challenging due to the overlapping symptoms between disorders and even more difficult without genetic screening. In this work, the diagnostic accuracy of the Generative Pre-Trained Transformer Model-4 (GPT-4), GPT-3.5, and Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMa) were evaluated in clinical vignettes of Deficiency of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (DIRA) and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). We then compared these models to a control group including one internal medicine physician. It was found that GPT-4 did not significantly differ in correctly identifying DIRA and FMF patients compared to the internist. However, the physician maintained a significantly higher accuracy than GPT-3.5 and LLaMa 2 for either disease. Overall, we explore and discuss the unique potential of LLMs in diagnostics for autoimmune diseases.}

abstract = {Background
Despite recent significant strides toward acceptance, inclusion, and equality, members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community still face alarming mental health disparities, being almost 3 times more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts than their heterosexual counterparts. These unique psychological challenges are due to discrimination, stigmatization, and identity-related struggles and can potentially benefit from generative conversational artificial intelligence (AI). As the latest advancement in AI, conversational agents and chatbots can imitate human conversation and support mental health, fostering diversity and inclusivity, combating stigma, and countering discrimination. In contrast, if not properly designed, they can perpetuate exclusion and inequities.
Objective
This study aims to examine the impact of generative conversational AI on the LGBTQ community.
Methods
This study was designed as a scoping review. Four electronic scholarly databases (Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and MEDLINE via PubMed) and gray literature (Google Scholar) were consulted from inception without any language restrictions. Original studies focusing on the LGBTQ community or counselors working with this community exposed to chatbots and AI-enhanced internet-based platforms and exploring the feasibility, acceptance, or effectiveness of AI-enhanced tools were deemed eligible. The findings were reported in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews).
Results
Seven applications (HIVST-Chatbot, TelePrEP Navigator, Amanda Selfie, Crisis Contact Simulator, REALbot, Tough Talks, and Queer AI) were included and reviewed. The chatbots and internet-based assistants identified served various purposes: (1) to identify LGBTQ individuals at risk of suicide or contracting HIV or other sexually transmitted infections, (2) to provide resources to LGBTQ youth from underserved areas, (3) facilitate HIV status disclosure to sex partners, and (4) develop training role-play personas encompassing the diverse experiences and intersecting identities of LGBTQ youth to educate counselors. The use of generative conversational AI for the LGBTQ community is still in its early stages. Initial studies have found that deploying chatbots is feasible and well received, with high ratings for usability and user satisfaction. However, there is room for improvement in terms of the content provided and making conversations more engaging and interactive. Many of these studies used small sample sizes and short-term interventions measuring limited outcomes.
Conclusions
Generative conversational AI holds promise, but further development and formal evaluation are needed, including studies with larger samples, longer interventions, and randomized trials to compare different content, delivery methods, and dissemination platforms. In addition, a focus on engagement with behavioral objectives is essential to advance this field. The findings have broad practical implications, highlighting that AI’s impact spans various aspects of people’s lives. Assessing AI’s impact on diverse communities and adopting diversity-aware and intersectional approaches can help shape AI’s positive impact on society as a whole.}

This study examines consumers' evaluations of product consumption values, purchase intentions and willingness to pay for fashion products designed using generative adversarial network (GAN), an artificial intelligence technology. This research investigates differences between consumers' evaluations of a GAN-generated product and a non-GAN-generated product and tests whether disclosing the use of GAN technology affects consumers' evaluations.
Design/methodology/approach
Sample products were developed as experimental stimuli using cycleGAN. Data were collected from 163 members of Generation Y. Participants were assigned to one of the three experimental conditions (i.e. non-GAN-generated images, GAN-generated images with disclosure and GAN-generated images without disclosure). Regression analysis and ANOVA were used to test the hypotheses.
Findings
Functional, social and epistemic consumption values positively affect willingness to pay in the GAN-generated products. Relative to non-GAN-generated products, willingness to pay is significantly higher for GAN-generated products. Moreover, evaluations of functional value, emotional value and willingness to pay are highest when GAN technology is used, but not disclosed.
Originality/value
This study evaluates the utility of GANs from consumers' perspective based on the perceived value of GAN-generated product designs. Findings have practical implications for firms that are considering using GANs to develop products for the retail fashion market.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a colossal buzzword, a confusing subject matter, but also an inevitable reality. Generative and nongenerative AI are the 2 core subtypes of AI. Generative AI uses current data to understand patterns and generate new information, and it is especially valuable in producing synthetic medical images, enhancing surgical simulations, and expanding training datasets. Techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), large language models (LLMs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs) allow for the creation of realistic simulations, text, and models that can be used for perioperative communication and planning. Conversely, nongenerative AI is centered on the examination and categorization of pre-existing data to formulate predictions or decisions—the most popular denomination namely machine learning. This approach is instrumental in tasks such as forecasting surgical outcomes, segmenting medical images, and determining patient risk profiles. Models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), random forests, and support vector machines (SVMs) are widely used for these purposes, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability in clinical decision making. Although generative AI offers innovative tools for creating new data and simulations, nongenerative AI excels in analyzing existing data to inform patient care. Both approaches have the potential of supporting clinical workflows to automate redundancies and improve efficiencies. However, there are also limitations in the application of AI in orthopaedics, including the potential for bias in models, the challenge of interpreting AI-driven insights, and the ethics of oversight. As the integration of AI in orthopaedics continues to grow, it is essential for practitioners to understand these technologies' capabilities and limitations to harness their full potential and establish appropriate governance.}

Introduction: Precision medicine aims to tailor healthcare decisions and interventions to the unique biological and clinical characteristics of each patient. The recent convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) with advances in digital health, omics, and big data analytics has accelerated progress toward this goal. AI technologies - particularly machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing and generative large language models - enable the rapid and meaningful analysis of complex biomedical datasets, supporting more individualized care. Purpose of review: In this narrative review, we provide an accessible overview of the core principles of AI for healthcare professionals and explore its practical applications across the spectrum of precision medicine. Real-world examples highlight how AI is being used to enhance early diagnosis, guide treatment selection, support disease prevention, and even contribute directly to therapeutic interventions. Alongside these advances, we discuss critical limitations and challenges, including ethical considerations, algorithmic bias, data privacy concerns, environmental impact, and practical barriers to clinical implementation. Conclusion: This review offers both an introduction to AI and a practical overview of how it is being used, and where its limitations lie, in precision medicine, with the goal of helping healthcare professionals understand these evolving tools and use them efficiently and responsibly in clinical practice.}

abstract = {Purpose
We compare human intelligence to artificial intelligence (AI) in the choice of appropriate Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) codes for research papers in economics.
Design/methodology/approach
We compare the JEL code choices related to articles published in the recent issues of the Journal of Economic Literature and the American Economic Review and compare these to the original JEL code choices of the authors in earlier working paper versions and JEL codes recommended by various generative AI systems (OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, Google’s Gemini) based on the abstracts of the articles.
Findings
There are significant discrepancies and often limited overlap between authors’ choices of JEL codes, editors’ choices as well as the choices by contemporary widely used AI systems. However, the observations suggest that generative AI can augment human intelligence in the micro-task of choosing the JEL codes and, thus, save researchers time.
Research limitations/implications
Rapid development of AI systems makes the findings quickly obsolete.
Practical implications
AI systems may economize on classification costs and (semi-)automate the choice of JEL codes by recommending the most appropriate ones. Future studies may apply the presented approach to analyze whether the JEL code choices between authors, editors and AI systems converge and become more consistent as humans increasingly interact with AI systems.
Originality/value
We assume that the choice of JEL codes is a micro-task in which boundedly rational decision-makers rather satisfice than optimize. This exploratory experiment is among the first to compare human intelligence and generative AI in choosing and justifying the choice of optimal JEL codes.}

abstract = {The prevailing data-driven paradigm in AI has largely neglected the generative nature of data. All data, whether observational or experimental, are produced under specific conditions, yet current approaches treat them as context-free artifacts. This neglect results in uneven data quality, limited interpretability, and fragility when models face novel scenarios. Evaluatology reframes evaluation as the process of inferring the influence of an evaluated object on the affected factors and attributing the evaluation outcome to specific ones. Among these factors, a minimal set of indispensable elements determines how changes in conditions propagate to outcomes. This essential set constitutes the evaluation conditions. Together, the evaluated object and its evaluation conditions form a self-contained evaluation system — a structured unit that anchors evaluation to its essential context. We propose an evaluatology-based paradigm, which spans the entire AI lifecycle — from data generation to training and evaluation. Within each self-contained evaluation system, data are generated and distilled into their invariant informational structures. These distilled forms are abstracted into reusable causal-chain schemas, which can be instantiated as training examples. By explicitly situating every learning instance within such condition-aware systems, evaluation is transformed from a passive, post-hoc procedure into an active driver of model development. This evaluation-based paradigm enables the construction of causal training data that are interpretable, traceable, and reusable, while reducing reliance on large-scale, unstructured datasets. This paves the way toward scalable, transparent, and epistemically grounded AI.}

abstract = {Data sharing is often hindered by concerns of patient privacy, regulatory aspects, and proprietary interests thereby impeding scientific progress and establishing a gatekeeping mechanism in clinical medicine since obtaining large data sets is costly and time-consuming. We employed two different generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies: CTAB-GAN+ and Normalizing Flows (NFlow) to synthesize clinical trial data based on pooled patient data from four previous multicenter clinical trials of the German Study Alliance Leukemia (AML96, AML2003, AML60+, SORAML) that enrolled adult patients (n=1606) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who received intensive induction therapy. As a generative adversarial network (GAN), CTAB-GAN+ consists of two adversarial networks: a generator producing synthetic samples from random noise and a discriminator aiming to distinguish between real and synthetic samples. The model converges as the discriminator can no longer reliably differentiate between real or synthetic data. Contrastingly, NFlow consists of a sequence of invertible transformations (flows) starting from a simple base distribution and gradually adding complexity to better mirror the training data. Both models were trained on tabular data including demographic, laboratory, molecular genetic and cytogenetic patient variables. Detection of molecular alterations in the original cohort was performed via next-generation sequencing (NGS) using the TruSight Myeloid Sequencing Panel (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with a 5% variant-allele frequency (VAF) mutation calling cut-off. For cytogenetics, standard techniques for chromosome banding and fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (FISH) were used. Hyperparameter tuning of generative models was conducted using the Optuna Framework. For each model, we used a total of 70 optimization trials to optimize a custom score inspired by TabSynDex which assesses both the resemblance of the synthetic data to real training data and its utility. Pairwise analyses were conducted between the original and both synthetic data sets, respectively. All tests were carried out as two-sided tests using a significance level α of 0.05. Table 1 summarizes baseline patient characteristics and outcome for both synthetic cohorts compared to the original cohort. Firstly, we found both models to adequately represent patient features, albeit that some individual variables showed a statistically significant deviation from the original cohort. It is important to note that for such a large sample size (n=1606 for each cohort), even miniscule differences can be rendered statistically significant notwithstanding any meaningful clinical difference. Interestingly, variables that deviated from the original distribution were different for both models indicating model architecture to play a vital role in sample representation: While CTAB-GAN+ showed significant deviations for both age and sex, NFlow showed significant deviations for AML status. Complete remission rate was similar between original (70.7%, odds ratio [OR]: 2.41) and CTAB-GAN+ (73.7%, OR: 2.81, p=0.059) and NFlow (69.1%, OR: 2.24, p=0.356). For event-free survival (EFS), which was not included as a target in hyperparameter tuning, both networks deviated significantly from the original cohort (original: median 7.2 months, HR: 1.36; CTAB-GAN+: median 12.8 months, HR 0.74, p<0.001; NFlow: median 9.0 months, HR: 0.87, p=0.001). Overall survival (OS) was well represented by NFlow compared to the original cohort, while CTAB-GAN+ showed a significant deviation (original: median 17.5 months, HR: 1.14; CTAB-GAN+: median 19.5 months, HR 0.88, p<0.001; NFlow: median 16.2 months, HR: 1.00, p=0.055). Both models showed an adequate graph representation in Kaplan-Meier analysis (Figure 1). Here, we demonstrate using two different generative AI technologies that synthetic data generation provides an attractive solution to circumvent issues in current standards of data collection and sharing. It effectively allows for bypassing logistical, organizational, and financial burdens, as well as regulatory and ethical concerns. Ultimately, this enables explorative research inquiries into previously inaccessible data sets and offers the prospect of fully synthetic control arms in prospective clinical trials.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing antimicrobial drug discovery by delivering major improvements in precision, innovation, and efficiency for combating bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. Traditional approaches to developing treatments for microbial infections are often hampered by high costs, lengthy timelines, and frequent failures. Modern AI technologies, particularly deep learning, machine learning, computational biology, and big data analytics, provide robust solutions to these challenges by analyzing large-scale biological datasets to predict molecular interactions, identify promising treatment candidates, and expedite both preclinical and clinical development. Innovative techniques such as generative adversarial networks for novel compound discovery, reinforcement learning for optimizing antimicrobial candidates, and natural language processing for extracting knowledge from biomedical literature are now vital to infectious disease research. These approaches facilitate early toxicity prediction, microbial target identification, virtual screening, and the development of more individualized therapies. Notwithstanding these advances, challenges remain, including inconsistent data quality, limited interpretability, and unresolved ethical or legal concerns. This review examines recent advancements in AI applications for microbial drug discovery, with a focus on de novo molecular design, ligand- and structure-based screening, and AI-enabled biomarker identification. Remaining application barriers and promising future directions in AI-driven antimicrobial drug development are also elucidated. Collectively, these innovations are poised to accelerate the discovery of new therapies, reduce costs, and enhance patient outcomes in the fight against infectious diseases.}

abstract = {The enormous amount of data and the substantial computational resources are crucial inputs of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, enabling the development and training of AI models. Incumbent firms in adjacent technology markets hold significant advantages in AI development, due to their established large user bases and substantial financial resources. These advantages facilitate the accumulation of enormous amounts of data, and the establishment of computational infrastructure necessary for sufficient data processing and high-performance computing. By controlling data and computational resources, incumbents raise entry barriers, leverage advantages to favour their own AI services, and drive significant vertical integration across the AI supply chain, thereby entrenching their market dominance and shielding themselves from competition. This article examines regulatory responses to these antitrust risks in the European Union (EU), the United States (US), and China, given their leadership in digital regulation and AI development. It demonstrates that the EU’s Digital Markets Act, and China’s Interim Measures for the Management of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services introduce broadly framed yet applicable rules to address challenges related to data and computational resources in AI markets. Conversely, the US lacks both AI regulations and digital-specific competition laws, instead adopting innovation-centric policies aimed at ensuring its AI dominance globally. Given the strategic importance of AI development, all three jurisdictions have adopted a cautious approach in investigating potential abusive practices.}
