AI data-driven methodologies have transformative potential for decision-making and policymaking in urban governance. However, a gap exists between AI’s theoretical promises and its practical integration into governance frameworks. While smart cities highlight technological advancements, they also expose socio-political challenges such as inclusivity, ethics, and public trust. This study systematically reviews literature on AI adoption in urban planning and governance, examining decision-making advancements and the socio-political dimensions of AI integration. Unlike previous studies, our review connects technological innovation with governance contexts, offering a nuanced analysis of AI’s role in urban systems. The findings show that AI research in urban governance is concentrated in Europe, North America, and Asia, with Africa and Central America being underrepresented. Since 2020, AI research has surged due to smart city initiatives but remains mostly theoretical with limited practical applications in urban governance. Additionally, AI’s integration with public administration and urban studies is minimal, raising concerns about equity and transparency in algorithmic decision-making. By identifying these gaps and challenges, this study provides actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and researchers. Inclusive governance frameworks that balance technological innovation with ethical and sociopolitical considerations are recommended, to ensure that AI-driven urban development promotes equitable, efficient, and sustainable outcomes.}

Hyperlipidemic lesions and occlusions to the vessels supplying the retina result in permanent blindness, necessitating prompt detection and treatment. Retinal vascular occlusion is diagnosed using different imaging modalities, including optical coherence tomography angiography. These diagnostic techniques obtain images representing the blood flow through the retinal vessels, providing an opportunity for AI to utilize image recognition to detect blockages and abnormalities before patients present with symptoms. AI is already being used as a non-invasive method to detect retinal vascular occlusions and other vascular pathology, as well as predict treatment outcomes. As providers see an increase in patients presenting with new retinal vascular occlusions, the use of AI to detect and treat these conditions has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce the financial burden on the healthcare system. This article comprehends the implications of AI in the current management strategies of retinal vascular occlusion (RVO) in hyperlipidemia and the recent developments of AI technology in the management of ocular diseases.}

The emergence of protein-protein interaction network studies in 2001 marked a turning point and promoted a holistic approach that considers the human body as an interconnected system. This is particularly evident in the study of bidirectional interactions between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral organs, which are critical for understanding health and disease. Understanding these complex interactions requires integrating multi-scale, heterogeneous data from molecular to organ levels, encompassing both omics (e.g., genomics, proteomics, microbiomics) and non-omics data (e.g., imaging, clinical phenotypes). Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly multi-modal models, has demonstrated significant potential in analyzing CNS-peripheral organ interactions by processing vast, heterogeneous datasets. Specifically, AI facilitates the identification of biomarkers, prediction of therapeutic targets, and simulation of drug effects on multi-organ systems, thereby paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies. This review highlights AI's transformative role in CNS-peripheral interaction research, focusing on its applications in unraveling disease mechanisms, discovering drug targets, and optimizing clinical trials through patient stratification and adaptive trial design.}

The literature is disparate and lacks cohesion, clarity, and, in some cases, depth. Subsequently, this scoping review aims to synthesize and critically reflect on the research on responsible AI. Based on this synthesis, we developed a conceptual framework for responsible AI governance (defined through structural, relational, and procedural practices), its antecedents, and its effects. The framework serves as the foundation for developing an agenda for future research and critically reflects on the notion of responsible AI governance.}

This shapes the reform trajectory of equity structures in State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), offering SOEs—typically viewed as weaker innovators—an opportunity to keep pace in the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we investigate the role of equity diversification in shaping SOEs’ AI innovation performance. Using the patent and equity structure data of Chinese listed SOEs during 2007–2023, we find that a 1% increase in equity diversification is associated with a 0.05% boost in AI patent applications filed by SOEs in the next year. This positive effect is achieved through: (i) reducing managerial short-termism and encouraging long-term strategic investments, (ii) directing managerial attention to emerging technologies like AI, and (iii) facilitating external learning and improving innovation efficiency. SOEs in the growth or maturity stage, operating in high-tech or competitive industries, and characterized by financial adequacy and commercial orientations benefit more from equity diversification. Additionally, this benefit is limited to AI innovation output, without affecting its quality or traditional innovation.}

The increasing availability of digital medical data, such as images, omics data, biosignals, and electronic health records, combined with advances in computing, has enabled AI models to approach expert-level performance. However, widespread clinical adoption remains limited, primarily due to challenges beyond technical performance, including ethical concerns, regulatory barriers, and lack of trust. To address these issues, medical AI systems must align with the principles of Trustworthy AI (TAI), which emphasize human agency and oversight, algorithmic robustness, privacy and data governance, transparency, bias and discrimination avoidance, and accountability. Yet, the complexity of healthcare processes (e.g., screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment) and the diversity of stakeholders (clinicians, patients, providers, regulators) complicate the integration of TAI principles. To bridge the gap between TAI theory and practical implementation, this paper proposes a design framework to support developers in embedding TAI principles into medical AI systems. Thus, for each stakeholder identified across various healthcare processes, we propose a disease-agnostic collection of requirements that medical AI systems should incorporate to adhere to the principles of TAI. Additionally, we examine the challenges and tradeoffs that may arise when applying these principles in practice. To illustrate the discussion, we focus on cardiovascular diseases, which is a field marked by both high prevalence and active AI innovation, and demonstrate how TAI principles have been applied and where key obstacles persist.}

The effectiveness of this framework is verified through two classical composite design cases: isotropic and homogeneous laminates. The laminating rules proposed by the data-driven framework are proven to be reasonable and consistent with those in common laminate practices. This work demonstrates the great potential of artificial intelligence not only in guiding laminate design but also in providing new perspectives on discovering composite theory.}

This paper argues that GenAI represents a qualitative shift that necessitates a fundamental reassessment of AI's role in management and organizations. By identifying and analyzing four critical dimensions (i) GenAI's broad applicability as a general-purpose technology; (ii) its ability to catalyze exploratory and combinatorial innovation; (iii) its capacity to enhance cognitive diversity and decision-making; and (iv) its democratizing effect on AI adoption and value creation the paper highlights GenAI's potential to augment and scale human creativity, learning, and innovation. Building on insights from the AI and management literature, as well as on theory of human-AI agency, the paper develops a novel perspective that challenges the dominant efficiency-oriented narrative. It proposes that a human-complementary approach to GenAI development and implementation, leveraging it as a generative catalyst for exploration, can enable radically increased creativity, innovation, and growth. GenAI's democratizing aspects can amplify these mechanisms, promoting widely shared growth when combined with appropriate policy and managerial choices. Implications for theory, practice, and future research directions are discussed, drawing attention to the need for approaches in GenAI development and deployment that are complementary rather than competitive to human beings. The paper concludes by discussing the theoretical, practical, and policy implications of this transformative technology. It outlines future research directions, emphasizing the critical role of human agency in determining the organizational, societal, and ethical outcomes associated with AI adoption and implementation.}

Most recently, during the first 3–4 years of public access to Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), many authors have bought into the bullish atmosphere, replaying consultancies' predictions about gold mines of process efficiency and innovation. A more balanced approach to the technology is needed. Instances of apparently positive results need calm analysis, firstly to distinguish mirages from genuine contributions; secondly, to identify ways to effectively exploit the new capabilities; and thirdly, to formulate guidance for the avoidance and mitigation of negative consequences. This article's first contribution is to ground the evaluation of GenAI's pathway, applications, impacts, implications and risks in a sufficiently deep appreciation of the technology's nature and key features. A wide range of sources is drawn on, in order to present descriptions of the processes involved in text-based GenAI. From those processes, 20 key characteristics are abstracted that together give rise to the promise and the threats GenAI embodies. The effects of GenAI derive not from the technological features alone, but also from the patterns within which it is put to use. By mapping usage patterns across to domains of application, the phenomenon's impacts and implications can be more reliably delineated. The analysis provides a platform whereby the article's final contribution can be made. Previously-formulated principles for the responsible application of AI of all kinds are applied in the particular context of GenAI.}

In the past two decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized data analytics, and cancer therapeutics is no exception. The application of AI in theranostics has attracted much attention in the past decade and is showing its capabilities in assisting the healthcare professionals in interpretation of intricate data. The current chapter highlights the role of AI in detection of cancer on different scales ranging from biomolecular to macromolecular. Among these, strategies at the macromolecular scale such as imaging techniques, are able to provide the requisite data in a more timely and cost-effective manner. AI for image analysis has provided extremely valuable information liable to escape the manual investigation. Herein lies the greatest advantage of AI that can play a critical role in cancer diagnostics and care. Consequently, the applications of AI in different aspects of cancer diagnostic such as pathology, treatment, and prognosis is discussed. However, the use of AI comes with certain limitations, which have also been deliberated. In summary, despite its limitations, AI has exhibited its potential to transform cancer theranostics and is poised to revolutionize cancer therapeutics in not a very distant future.}

abstract = {Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a widespread neurodevelopmental condition that significantly impacts many children. This review systematically explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), in diagnosing ADHD and predicting treatment responses from clinical data (demographics, questionnaires, cognitive tests, and biological variables) and neuroimaging modalities including electroencephalogram (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI), magnetoencephalogram (MEG), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and positron emission tomography (PET). We searched papers published until October 2024 via Scopus, Web of Science (WOS), and PubMed and reviewed 147 studies on ADHD diagnosis and treatment response prediction. This study’s primary contribution is the broad integration of its studies on both diagnosis and response prediction of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments in ADHD using AI methods, relying on feature extraction/selection methods and biomarkers rather than focusing on just one part. Furthermore, it is the first review to specifically evaluate the application of AI in predicting response to ADHD treatment. To have a better view, we investigated the data in clinical/demographic categories, neuroimaging techniques, and using neuroimaging/clinical biomarkers for ADHD diagnosis and predicting response to treatment. Our findings emphasize the widespread application of AI in ADHD detection and show promising results with EEG signals (accuracy up to 99.95 %) and MRI modalities (accuracy up to 92.8 % with a combination of sMRI and fMRI) data while highlighting the limited application of AI in predicting treatment responses. Support vector machines (SVMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) methods have been used more among AI methods. Also, extracting and selecting features from EEG signals is more prevalent than other neuroimaging techniques, and functional connectivity biomarkers in fMRI showed superior performance. Future research should aim to develop integrated AI models that can accurately diagnose and predict personalized treatment responses.}

In this paper, I synthesize and summarize the literature on artificial intelligence and compensation management and describe four key challenges that companies face in using AI to manage compensation strategically. The first challenge is when and how to use AI to automate and augment compensation tasks and decisions. The second challenge is how to use AI effectively to improve fairness and equity in compensation practices. The third challenge is explaining how AI recommended changes in compensation practices are derived. The fourth challenge is how to actually be strategic using AI solutions.

Utilizing this abundant multi-banded optical satellite data for floating debris monitoring, many artificial intelligence-based approaches were proposed. These approaches face various challenges due to the multidimensional nature of the earth observation data visualized on a reduced scale. This work identifies various stages of AI deployment for floating debris identification, classification, segmentation, density estimation, and/or temporal study. The challenges during each stage along with some potential solutions applied in this field or elsewhere have been identified. Since AI approaches are data-driven, the limitation of labeled data with real-time diversity of shape, color, texture, size, and composition of floating debris placed against different backgrounds is most acute. The work proposes the utilization of some recent AI-based systems, like continuous learning, transfer learning, attention-based transformers, explainable AI, etc., to resolve these identified challenges. The work calls for further research into the application of pre-trained models, semi-supervised learning, and multi-modal data fusion for overcoming the labeled data deficiency. Additionally, harmful debris density estimation and factors leading to a change in the estimated density need further research.}

abstract = {Introduction
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone cancer particularly in individuals aged 0–19, classified into different stages. Early diagnosis improves survival, Determination of prognosis and treatment based on it, and enables limb-sparing surgery. AI, in particular machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), helps analyze large datasets, identify biomarkers, predict prognosis, and personalize treatments by assessing the aforementioned features. AI has the potential to improve evaluation procedures, such as imaging and pathology approaches used in OS diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. This study systematically examines AI's synergistic role with conventional evaluating techniques in OS treatment, improving prognostication, predicting therapy responses, and developing personalized treatment strategies.
Method
We performed an extensive search via several databases until April 23, 2024. Machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) as the main branches of AI are often utilized in the medical sciences were searched for detection classification, and prognostication of osteosarcoma. RAYYAN.ai was used to screen the articles through the titles and abstracts. We conducted data extraction on the included articles and employed Cochrane and QUIPS tools to assess potential bias in the included non-prognosis and prognosis studies to evaluate their quality, respectively.
Results
There were 8129 articles obtained from the four databases following a thorough search. Of them 8050 ones were excluded and the remaining 78 articles published from 2013 to 2024 were reviewed. A large number of the articles indicated moderate and low risk of bias as a result of the risk of bias assessment. The majority of the articles that were reviewed (n = 48) concerned the clinical aspects of osteosarcoma; of these, 23 and 25 studies assessed diagnosis and prognoses, respectively. Furthermore, 20 articles examined image analysis specifically, 4 examined image segmentation methods, and 16 introduced classifiers to identify osteosarcoma from other diseases.
Conclusion
AI improves biomarker identification, diagnostics, and prognosis of osteosarcoma through medical imaging and data integration. Models like ResNet50 and CNN show high performance but face real-world limitations due to data heterogeneity and overfitting. This study explores AI's role in osteosarcoma diagnosis, emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration, external validation, and real-world application challenges.}

Regarding LCA/AI models, the results show that AI can anticipate environmental impacts but model performance depends on the amount of data available. LCA/AI models can be used for eco-design and decision-making. However, it is necessary to develop standardised methodologies to evaluate AI environmental impacts. Regarding AI and photovoltaics, AI provides remarkably interesting applications: design, optimisation and prediction of parameters related to different kinds of photovoltaics (concentrating, building-integrated, etc.). As for AI and smart grids, AI offers advantages such as integration of intermittent renewable energy sources and decentralised-grid management. With respect to AI and small-island economies, factors such as effective energy storage, energy plans and estimation of the degree of susceptibility to disasters are important.

abstract = {Chemical process control is traditionally one of the most mathematically demanding courses in the chemical engineering curriculum. Students need to master ordinary differential equations (ODEs), Laplace transforms, transfer functions and proportional‑integral‑derivative (PID) controller design. At Villanova University we developed a pilot project to integrate artificial‑intelligence assistance throughout the process‑control pipeline. Three modules were created: (1) Python coding for ODE simulation, (2) Laplace and inverse Laplace transforms with transfer‑function parameter estimation, and (3) PID controller tuning. For each module, pre-class videos and handouts introduced theoretical concepts and demonstrated example code. Students reviewed these materials before class, and class time was used primarily for answering questions and clarifying concepts. Most project work was completed independently outside of class. Students were instructed to ask a large‑language‑model chatbot (ChatGPT) to explain equations, generate and debug Python code, and interpret the physical meaning of models. Pre‑class handouts and videos prepared students for both in-class and independent practice, and anonymous surveys measured learning impact and students’ overall experience. Fifty-nine students completed all three modules and responded to a 15-question survey, which included 13 multiple-choice rating questions and 2 open-ended questions. The rating questions were grouped into categories measuring students’ confidence in Python coding, understanding of ODE modeling and process control concepts, ability to use AI tools effectively, and perceived applicability of the skills to real-world problems. Responses were scored on a five-point scale, where a rating of 5 indicated the most positive feedback. Statistical analysis showed mean ratings ranging from 3.28 to 4.36, with the highest confidence gain reported in the category assessing the ability to apply the learned skills to real-world problems. Qualitative comments reveal that students valued the novelty of using AI tools but desired clearer instructions and more coding guidance. This study demonstrates a fully integrated approach to AI-assisted education in chemical process control, spanning ODE modeling, Laplace transform, transfer functions, and controller tuning within a single coherent framework. By combining Python-based coding in Google Colab with structured AI interaction strategies, the work bridges theoretical concepts and practical applications across the entire modeling–control pipeline. This project offers an example for AI-based control and engineering education studies.}

In this study, the AIOps for wind turbines based on SCADA data considering anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and incremental training is proposed and researched. A long short-term memory-based asymmetric variational autoencoding Gaussian mixture model (LSTM-AVAGMM) was established and used to detect early anomalies, and the threshold was set with a 99.7% confidence interval for the distribution curve fitted by kernel density estimation (KDE). Moreover, to provide guidance on O&M once an anomaly warning signal is issued, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was introduced to conduct root cause analysis by assigning each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Finally, a novel incremental training strategy based on deep generative replay and fine-tuning was demonstrated to improve model adaptability in complex environments. Two real cases from a wind farm located in northeast China were presented. Comparative studies showed the robustness and competitiveness of the proposed methods in predicting failures, locating anomalies, and adaptively updating wind turbines, and the effects of various applied parameters were also described.}

Social sustainability (SS) is essential to create just and inclusive societies where people's basic needs are satisfied, human rights are protected, and social cohesion and fairness exist. To achieve holistic, sustainable development, policymakers and management must consider SS and environmental and economic considerations. Employees' social and behavioral interactions impact SS and business ethics. Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) can learn from artificial intelligence (AI) for better decision-making, operational optimization, increased employability, and employee empowerment. Therefore, this research aims to assess how artificial intelligence technology affects SS and business ethics in the MSMEs. We studied the artificial intelligence (AI) readiness among MSME companies in developing nations. We analyzed AI readiness using the theory of technology-organization-environment (TOE). Further, we also studied AI readiness and its influence on business ethics and SS, which we measured through skill development, work conditions, environment, and safety among MSMEs. We collected the data from 236 MSME employees. We used Structural Equation Modeling using SmartPLS software for data analysis. The research findings indicated that AI readiness directly impacts SS. We also found that the findings directly impact employees' social and ethical behavior. We also observed that business ethics significantly affects SS, indicating partial mediation. This study has substantial theoretical and managerial implications as policymakers and MSME leadership need to consider SS an essential component of sustainable development.}

However, a significant gap exists in understanding how AI-based learning in higher education curricula influences graduates' readiness and commitment to be accountants. Addressing this gap, this study aims to answer two pivotal questions: how do AI learning experiences affect AI self-efficacy and career commitment, and how do literacy, motivations, and competency factors mediate this relationship? This study grounds in Self-determination Theory (SDT) and Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) to answer the questions and utilizes a multiple mediation model with partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze survey data gathered from 698 fresh graduates in accounting and finance program across the country (Indonesia). The finding confirms that AI-based learning experiences in higher education influence fresh graduates’ AI self-efficacy and career commitment through the mediating role of AI literacy, competency, and motivations. This study demonstrates that AI-based learning enhances students' literacy and competencies in AI/accounting software while boosting intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to master AI skills for future career benefits. Ultimately, increased motivation, literacy, and competencies strengthen graduates' self-efficacy and confidence, supporting their commitment to a career in accounting. This study, therefore, contributes a novel insight by providing empirical considerations for higher education and the accounting industry to strengthen AI-based curricula for future workforce supply.}

The multifactorial nature of AD, shaped by genetic, environmental, and biological factors, complicates both research and clinical management. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and multi-omics technologies provide new opportunities to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of AD and identify early biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. AI-driven approaches such as machine learning, deep learning, and network-based models have enabled the integration of large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and microbiomic datasets. These efforts have facilitated the discovery of novel molecular signatures and therapeutic targets. Methods including deep belief networks and joint deep semi-non-negative matrix factorization have contributed to improvements in disease classification and patient stratification. However, ongoing challenges remain. These include data heterogeneity, limited interpretability of complex models, a lack of large and diverse datasets, and insufficient clinical validation. The absence of standardized multi-omics data processing methods further restricts progress. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in AI-driven multi-omics research in AD, highlighting achievements in early diagnosis and biomarker discovery while discussing limitations and future directions needed to advance these approaches toward clinical application.}

This review explores the role artificial intelligence has had on cardiac imaging, electrophysiology, interventional procedures, and intensive care monitoring as it relates to children and adults with congenital heart disease. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have enhanced not only imaging segmentation and processing but also diagnostic accuracy namely reducing interobserver variability. This has a meaningful impact in complex congenital heart disease improving anatomic diagnosis, assessment of cardiac function, and predicting long-term outcomes. Image processing has benefited procedural planning for interventional cardiology, allowing for a higher quality and density of information to be extracted from the same imaging modalities. In electrophysiology, deep learning models have enhanced the diagnostic potential of electrocardiograms, detecting subtle yet meaningful variation in signals that enable early diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction, risk stratification of mortality, and more accurate diagnosis and prediction of arrhythmias. In the congenital heart disease population, this has the potential for meaningful prolongation of life. Postoperative care in the cardiac intensive care unit is a data-rich environment that is often overwhelming. Detection of subtle data trends in this environment for early detection of morbidity is a ripe avenue for artificial intelligence algorithms to be used. Examples like early detection of catheter-induced thrombosis have already been published. Despite their great promise, artificial intelligence algorithms are still limited by hurdles such as data standardization, algorithm validation, drift, and explainability.}

abstract = {Background
Recent years have witnessed an explosive surge in dental research related to artificial intelligence (AI). These applications have optimised dental workflows, demonstrating significant clinical importance. Understanding the current landscape and trends of this topic is crucial for both clinicians and researchers to utilise and advance this technology. However, a comprehensive scientometric study regarding this field had yet to be performed.
Methods
A literature search was conducted in the Web of Science Core Collection database to identify eligible “research articles” and “reviews.” Literature screening and exclusion were performed by 2 investigators. Thereafter, VOSviewer was utilised in co-occurrence analysis and CiteSpace in co-citation analysis. R package Bibliometrix was employed to automatically calculate scientific impacts, determining the core authors and journals. Altmetric data were described narratively and supplemented with Spearman correlation analysis.
Results
A total of 1558 research publications were included. During the past 5 years, AI-related dental publications drastically increased in number, from 36 to 581. Diagnostics and Scientific Reports published the most articles, whereas Journal of Dental Research received the highest number of citations per article. China, the US, and South Korea emerged as the most prolific countries, whilst Germany received the highest number of citations per article (23.29). Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin was the institution with the highest number of publications and citations per article (29.16). Altmetric Attention Score was correlated with News Mentions (P < .001), and significant associations were observed amongst Dimension Citations, Mendeley Readers, and Web of Science Citations (P < .001).
Conclusions
The publication numbers regarding AI-related dental research have been rising rapidly and may continue their upwards trend. China, the US, South Korea, and Germany had promoted the progress of AI-related dental research. Disease diagnosis, orthodontic applications, and morphology segmentation were current hotspots. Attention mechanism, explainable AI, multimodal data fusion, and AI-generated text assistants necessitate future research and exploration.}

abstract = {Introduction
This study evaluates the performance of ChatGPT, particularly its versions 4 and 4o, in answering questions from the French orthopedic and trauma surgery exam (Diplôme d’Études Spécialisées, DES), compared to the results of French orthopedic surgery residents. Previous research has examined ChatGPT's capabilities across various medical specialties and exams, with mixed results, especially in the interpretation of complex radiological images.
Hypothesis
ChatGPT version 4o was capable of achieving a score equal to or higher (not lower) than that of residents for the DES exam.
Methods
The response capabilities of the ChatGPT model, versions 4 and 4o, were evaluated and compared to the results of residents for 250 questions taken from the DES exams from 2020 to 2024. A secondary analysis focused on the differences in the AI's performance based on the type of data being analyzed (text or images) and the topic of the questions.
Results
The score achieved by ChatGPT-4o was equivalent to that of residents over the past five years: 74.8% for ChatGPT-4o vs. 70.8% for residents (p = 0.32). The accuracy rate of ChatGPT was significantly higher in its latest version 4o compared to version 4 (58.8%, p = 0.0001). Secondary subgroup analysis revealed a performance deficiency of the AI in analyzing graphical images (success rates of 48% and 65% for ChatGPT-4 and 4o, respectively). ChatGPT-4o showed superior performance to version 4 when the topics involved the spine, pediatrics, and lower limb.
Conclusion
The performance of ChatGPT-4o is equivalent to that of French students in answering questions from the DES in orthopedic and trauma surgery. Significant progress has been observed between versions 4 and 4o. The analysis of questions involving iconography remains a notable challenge for the current versions of ChatGPT, with a tendency for the AI to perform less effectively compared to questions requiring only text analysis.

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have transformed health care with applications in various specialized fields. Neurosurgery can benefit from artificial intelligence in surgical planning, predicting patient outcomes, and analyzing neuroimaging data. GPT-4, an updated language model with additional training parameters, has exhibited exceptional performance on standardized exams. This study examines GPT-4’s competence on neurosurgical board-style questions, comparing its performance with medical students and residents, to explore its potential in medical education and clinical decision-making.
Methods
GPT-4’s performance was examined on 643 Congress of Neurological Surgeons Self-Assessment Neurosurgery Exam (SANS) board-style questions from various neurosurgery subspecialties. Of these, 477 were text-based and 166 contained images. GPT-4 refused to answer 52 questions that contained no text. The remaining 591 questions were inputted into GPT-4, and its performance was evaluated based on first-time responses. Raw scores were analyzed across subspecialties and question types, and then compared to previous findings on Chat Generative pre-trained transformer performance against SANS users, medical students, and neurosurgery residents.
Results
GPT-4 attempted 91.9% of Congress of Neurological Surgeons SANS questions and achieved 76.6% accuracy. The model’s accuracy increased to 79.0% for text-only questions. GPT-4 outperformed Chat Generative pre-trained transformer (P < 0.001) and scored highest in pain/peripheral nerve (84%) and lowest in spine (73%) categories. It exceeded the performance of medical students (26.3%), neurosurgery residents (61.5%), and the national average of SANS users (69.3%) across all categories.
Conclusions
GPT-4 significantly outperformed medical students, neurosurgery residents, and the national average of SANS users. The mode’s accuracy suggests potential applications in educational settings and clinical decision-making, enhancing provider efficiency, and improving patient care.}

The traditional consent process, reliant on face-to-face interactions and paper-based documentation, is increasingly being supplemented by digital solutions that offer remote consultations, personalized patient information, and electronic consent forms. These digital pathways not only improve accessibility and patient comprehension but also streamline documentation, reducing errors and administrative burdens. AI technologies, including ambient digital scribes and large language models (LLMs), could further augment this process by generating personalized risk assessments, simplifying complex medical information, and facilitating multilingual communication. However, success will also depend on addressing ethical concerns, ensuring equitable access, and preserving the irreplaceable human connection between patients and clinicians.

An integrated assessment of technological options is required for the effective deployment of CCUS large-scale infrastructure between CO2 production and utilization/sequestration nodes. However, developing cost-effective strategies from engineering and operation perspectives to implement CCUS is challenging. This is due to the diversity of upstream emitting processes located in different geographical areas, available downstream utilization technologies, storage sites capacity/location, and current/future energy/emissions/economic conditions. This paper identifies the need to achieve a robust hybrid assessment tool for CCUS modeling, simulation, and optimization based mainly on artificial intelligence (AI) combined with mechanistic methods. Thus, a critical literature review is conducted to assess CCUS technologies and their related process modeling/simulation/optimization techniques, while evaluating the needs for improvements or new developments to reduce overall CCUS systems design and operation costs. These techniques include first principles- based and data-driven ones, i.e. AI and related machine learning (ML) methods. Besides, the paper gives an overview on the role of life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate CCUS systems where the combined LCA-AI approach is assessed. Other advanced methods based on the AI/ML capabilities/algorithms can be developed to optimize the whole CCUS value chain. Interpretable ML combined with explainable AI can accelerate optimum materials selection by giving strong rules which accelerates the design of capture/utilization plants afterwards. Besides, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) coupled with process simulations will accelerate process design/operation optimization through considering simultaneous optimization of equipment sizing and operating conditions. Moreover, generative deep learning (GDL) is a key solution to optimum capture/utilization materials design/discovery. The developed AI methods can be generalizable where the extracted knowledge can be transferred to future works to help cutting the costs of CCUS value chain.}

Background
The internet is a common source of health information for patients. Interactive online artificial intelligence (AI) may be a more reliable source of health-related information than traditional search engines. This study aimed to assess the quality and perceived utility of chat-based AI responses related to 3 common gastrointestinal (GI) surgical procedures.
Methods
A survey of 24 questions covering general perioperative information on cholecystectomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), and colectomy was created. Each question was posed to Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) in June 2023, and the generated responses were recorded. The quality and perceived utility of responses were independently and subjectively graded by expert respondents specific to each surgical field. Grades were classified as “poor,” “fair,” “good,” “very good,” or “excellent.”
Results
Among the 45 respondents (general surgeon [n = 13], surgical oncologist [n = 18], colorectal surgeon [n = 13], and transplant surgeon [n = 1]), most practiced at an academic facility (95.6%). Respondents had been in practice for a mean of 12.3 years (general surgeon, 14.5 ± 7.2; surgical oncologist, 12.1 ± 8.2; colorectal surgeon, 10.2 ± 8.0) and performed a mean 53 index operations annually (cholecystectomy, 47 ± 28; PD, 28 ± 27; colectomy, 81 ± 44). Overall, the most commonly assigned quality grade was “fair” or “good” for most responses (n = 622/1080, 57.6%). Most of the 1080 total utility grades were “fair” (n = 279, 25.8%) or “good” (n = 344, 31.9%), whereas only 129 utility grades (11.9%) were “poor.” Of note, ChatGPT responses related to cholecystectomy (45.3% [“very good”/“excellent”] vs 18.1% [“poor”/“fair”]) were deemed to be better quality than AI responses about PD (18.9% [“very good”/“excellent”] vs 46.9% [“poor”/“fair”]) or colectomy (31.4% [“very good”/“excellent”] vs 38.3% [“poor”/“fair”]). Overall, only 20.0% of the experts deemed ChatGPT to be an accurate source of information, whereas 15.6% of the experts found it unreliable. Moreover, 1 in 3 surgeons deemed ChatGPT responses as not likely to reduce patient-physician correspondence (31.1%) or not comparable to in-person surgeon responses (35.6%).
Conclusions
Although a potential resource for patient education, ChatGPT responses to common GI perioperative questions were deemed to be of only modest quality and utility to patients. In addition, the relative quality of AI responses varied markedly on the basis of procedure type.}

Risk stratification has traditionally been performed using epidemiological studies and genetic analyses, through which key risk factors, including smoking, diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, and inherited predispositions, have been identified. However, the multifactorial nature of PDAC has often been insufficiently addressed by these methods, leading to limited precision in individualized risk assessments. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have been proposed as a transformative approach, allowing the integration of diverse datasets—spanning genetic, clinical, lifestyle, and imaging data into dynamic models capable of uncovering novel interactions and risk profiles. In this review, the evolution of PDAC risk stratification is explored, with classical epidemiological frameworks compared to AI-driven methodologies. Genetic insights, including genome-wide association studies and polygenic risk scores, are discussed, alongside AI models such as machine learning, radiomics, and deep learning. Strengths and limitations of these approaches are evaluated, with challenges in clinical translation, such as data scarcity, model interpretability, and external validation, addressed. Finally, future directions are proposed for combining classical and AI-driven methodologies to develop scalable, personalized predictive tools for PDAC, with the goal of improving early detection and patient outcomes.}

Conventional ED faces challenges such as low ion selectivity and membrane fouling, while Bipolar Membrane ED offers enhanced pH control and lithium recovery but is hindered by high energy consumption and membrane instability. Selective ED improves lithium selectivity using monovalent ion-selective membranes but is limited by high costs, scaling and batch operation. Redox-Couple ED, still in its early stages, requires further development for industrial scalability. The review highlights the importance of optimizing operational parameters, including voltage, current density, pH, flow rate and temperature to enhance ion migration and minimize inefficiencies. A techno-economic analysis shows the potential of ED-based lithium production to be cost-effective, though large-scale viability remains uncertain. Membrane fouling, caused by scale-forming ions, can be mitigated through pretreatment and cleaning methods, but further research is necessary to improve membrane durability and performance. Despite ED's environmental advantages, innovations such as introducing CO2 into the ED catholyte to produce Li2CO3, thereby eliminating the need for sodium carbonate as a precipitator show promise for reducing energy consumption. Finally, research directions on artificial intelligence (AI) for extracting lithium using ED are provided.}

This paper will view the rise of the e-patient, who is “equipped, enabled, empowered, and engaged” through the lens of the evolution of successive digital technology innovations, each building on its predecessors, creating new tools for patient empowerment. We begin with the dawn of the web and the proliferation of health websites and discuss the use of digital communication tools. We then discuss the adoption of electronic health records, which enabled the rise of patient portals. This digitization of health data, along with the rapid adoption of mobile internet access and the proliferation of health-related smartphone apps, in turn, provided a platform for patients to coproduce health care by contributing their own health data to their self-care and health care. The exchange of health information between patients and providers has also been facilitated by telehealth or telemedicine technology, which enables direct care delivery. The use of social networks in health, in use since the early days of the web, has expanded since COVID-19, when public health authorities worldwide, as well as patients, sought the use of social media channels to get connected and share information. Most recently, artificial intelligence and large language models have emerged with yet untapped potential to provide patients with the information that could improve their understanding of their conditions and treatment options. We conclude that innovations in digital health technology have symbiotically evolved with the ascendance of the e-patient, enabling improved communication, collaboration, and coordination between patients and clinicians and forging a health care system that is safer and more responsive to patient needs.}

abstract = {Background
The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system is a widely used tool to assess preoperative risk. However, variability in assigning ASA scores due to subjectivity among healthcare workers remains an issue. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) present an opportunity to improve the consistency of ASA classifications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), to assign ASA scores in pediatric surgical patients. The authors hypothesized that ChatGPT's classifications would correlate with anesthesiologist-determined ASA scores.
Methods
This retrospective cross-sectional pilot study was conducted at a tertiary pediatric hospital, including 203 pediatric patients who underwent surgery between June 4–7, 2023. Summaries of each patient's medical history and surgery details were created and reviewed by a board-certified anesthesiologist. These summaries were presented to both a study anesthesiologist and entered into ChatGPT (x2) for ASA classification. The ASA classifications by ChatGPT were compared to those provided by both the study anesthesiologist and the day-of-surgery (DOS) anesthesiologist. Cohen's kappa with linear weighting was used to assess inter-rater agreement between ChatGPT and anesthesiologists and to measure intra-rater reliability between different ChatGPT outputs.
Results
A total of 203 pediatric cases were analyzed. The agreement between repeated ASA classifications from ChatGPT was significant (κ=0.61, 95% CI 0.52–0.69) with 66% exact match in classifications. The agreement between the first ChatGPT output and the study anesthesiologist showed statistical agreement (κ=0.60, 95% CI 0.51–0.69), with a 66% match. Similarly, the second ChatGPT output had agreement with the study anesthesiologist (κ=0.59, 95% CI 0.50–0.68), with a 67% match. The highest agreement (κ=0.72, 95% CI 0.62–0.81) was observed between the DOS anesthesiologist and the study anesthesiologist, with a 75% match.
Conclusions
The correlation between ChatGPT's ASA scores and those assigned by the pilot study anesthesiologist was found to be 66–67%. These findings indicate that AI has the potential to support pediatric anesthesiologists in determining patient ASA classifications.}

abstract = {The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in digital pathology is limited by technical inconsistencies in the production of whole slide images (WSIs). This causes degraded AI performance and poses a challenge for widespread clinical application, as fine-tuning algorithms for each site is impractical. Changes in the imaging workflow can also compromise diagnostic accuracy and patient safety. Physical color calibration of scanners, relying on a biomaterial-based calibrant slide and a spectrophotometric reference measurement, has been proposed for standardizing WSI appearance, but its impact on AI performance has not been investigated. We evaluated whether physical color calibration can enable robust AI performance. We trained fully supervised and foundation model–based AI systems for detecting and Gleason grading prostate cancer using WSIs of prostate biopsies from the STHLM3 clinical trial (n = 3651) and evaluated their performance in 3 external cohorts (n = 1161) with and without calibration. With physical color calibration, the fully supervised system’s concordance with pathologists’ grading (Cohen linearly weighted κ) improved from 0.439 to 0.619 in the Stavanger University Hospital cohort (n = 860), from 0.354 to 0.738 in the Karolinska University Hospital cohort (n = 229), and from 0.423 to 0.452 in the Aarhus University Hospital cohort (n = 72). The foundation model’s concordance improved as follows: from 0.739 to 0.760 (Karolinska), from 0.424 to 0.459 (Aarhus), and from 0.547 to 0.670 (Stavanger). This study demonstrated that physical color calibration provides a potential solution to the variation introduced by different scanners, making AI-based cancer diagnostics more reliable and applicable in diverse clinical settings.}

User-friendly artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are increasingly being explored to assist healthcare teams in their decision-making processes. As accurate diagnosis in all medical fields is vital in treatment planning, this research seeks to explore the function of two specific AI chatbots, ChatGPT and Perplexity AI, in distinguishing the various types of dysphonia (organic, functional, and neurological).
Material and methods
In experiment 1, a script combining voice self-assessments plus the acoustic analysis, and in experiment 2, only the acoustic analysis of 37 dysphonic patients was fed into the ChatGPT and Perplexity AI chatbots specifying the type and asked to develop a complex AI-based model to determine dysphonia type. Then, the same process was redone with data from a sample of 27 other patients as a test.
Results
Although ChatGPT could not analyze the data and only provided guidance, the Cohen's Kappa agreement between experts’ diagnoses and Perplexity AI diagnoses in experiment 1 (P=0.773) and experiment 2 (P=0.067) lacked statistically significance.
Conclusion
Regarding the preliminary poor performance of AI chatbots in differential diagnosis of dysphonia type, it is not currently recommended to use them in clinical settings. However, modifications in AI chatbots in the future might provide more promising results in determining the dysphonia type. Further research is needed to shed light on AI chatbots ability in voice clinics.}

Traditional regional climate models often struggle to accurately represent the atmospheric behavior in such areas.

This study presents the results of atmospheric data generated using a new type of artificial intelligence (AI) models, aimed to reduce the computational cost of generating downscaled climate data using climate regional models like the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model over the Andes. The WRF model was selected for this comparison due to its frequent use in simulating atmospheric variables in the Andes. Our results demonstrate a higher downscaling performance for the four target weather variables studied (temperature, relative humidity, zonal and meridional wind) over coastal, mountain, and jungle regions.

This systematic review aims to evaluate the integration of AI models with wearable IMUs in health care, identifying current applications, challenges, and future opportunities. The focus will be on the types of models used, the characteristics of the datasets, and the potential for expanding and enhancing the use of this technology to improve patient care and advance medical research.
Methods
This study examines this synergy of AI models and IMU data by using a systematic methodology, following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, to explore 3 core questions: (1) Which medical fields are most actively researching AI and IMU data? (2) Which models are being used in the analysis of IMU data within these medical fields? (3) What are the characteristics of the datasets used for in this fields?
Results
The median dataset size is of 50 participants, which poses significant limitations for AI models given their dependency on large datasets for effective training and generalization. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the current dominance of machine learning models in 76% on the surveyed studies, suggesting a preference for traditional models like linear regression, support vector machine, and random forest, but also indicating significant growth potential for deep learning models in this area. Impressively, 93% of the studies used supervised learning, revealing an underuse of unsupervised learning, and indicating an important area for future exploration on discovering hidden patterns and insights without predefined labels or outcomes. In addition, there was a preference for conducting studies in clinical settings (77%), rather than in real-life scenarios, a choice that, along with the underapplication of the full potential of wearable IMUs, is recognized as a limitation in terms of practical applicability. Furthermore, the focus of 65% of the studies on neurological issues suggests an opportunity to broaden research scope to other clinical areas such as musculoskeletal applications, where AI could have significant impacts.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the review calls for a collaborative effort to address the highlighted challenges, including improvements in data collection, increasing dataset sizes, a move that inherently pushes the field toward the adoption of more complex deep learning models, and the expansion of the application of AI models on IMU data methodologies across various medical fields. This approach aims to enhance the reliability, generalizability, and clinical applicability of research findings, ultimately improving patient outcomes and advancing medical research.}

abstract = {The increasing knowledge in the molecular pathophysiology of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) allowed early identification of druggable targets; however, the advanced disease remains incurable mainly due to drug resistance. Therefore, it is essential to explore new methodological approaches for pharmacological strategies based on longitudinal molecular and imaging monitoring of NSCLC evolution, which can support decision-making for personalized treatments in clinical practice and provide new insight for the design of innovative clinical trials. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) presents an extraordinary opportunity to develop algorithms capable of decoding the complex, multifaceted patterns of NSCLC progression. AI needs input information from biomarker analyses on liquid biopsies, radiomic data, actionable targets involved in cancer drug resistance, and clinically relevant information for choosing personalized next-line therapies, including existing drugs that could target previously unconsidered resistance pathways (drug repurposing), and selecting sequential or combinatorial therapeutic approaches as a fundamental part of precision medicine. This narrative review explores the opportunity of integrating AI-based multiparametric models into reactive and proactive algorithms to offer patients new therapeutic options for long-term quality-adjusted survival.}

Traditionally reliant on histological methods and clinical correlations, neuropathology is now experiencing a revolution due to the development of AI technologies like machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). These technologies enhance diagnostic accuracy, optimize workflows, and enable personalized treatment strategies. AI algorithms excel at analyzing histopathological images, often revealing subtle morphological changes missed by conventional methods. For example, deep learning models applied to digital pathology can effectively differentiate tumor grades and detect rare pathologies, leading to earlier and more precise diagnoses. Progress in neuroimaging is another helpful tool of AI, as enhanced analysis of MRI and CT scans supports early detection of neurodegenerative diseases. By identifying biomarkers and progression patterns, AI aids in timely therapeutic interventions, potentially slowing disease progression. In molecular pathology, AI’s ability to analyze complex genomic data helps uncover the genetic and molecular basis of neuropathological conditions, facilitating personalized treatment plans. AI-driven automation streamlines routine diagnostic tasks, allowing pathologists to focus on complex cases, especially in settings with limited resources. This review explores AI's integration into neuropathology, highlighting its current applications, benefits, challenges, and future directions.}

Currently available cloud-based AI platforms are mostly commercial – e.g. Amazon Web Services (AWS) –, requiring subscriptions that are not affordable for small to medium-scale farmers. Therefore, in this position paper, an AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) platform supporting multiple AI tasks with modern open-source tools integrable with PA systems is proposed, with the goal of enabling a cost-effective dissemination through farmers community and related professionals. This platform has already some fully functional modules that will be demonstrated on a PA sourced grapevines imagery, encompassing classification and segmentation tasks.}

We demonstrate that the decision to introduce AI is influenced by the retailer’s estimation of the consumers’ green preference (CGP) without AI as well as the unit adoption cost of AI. Specifically, irrespective of whether the retailer underestimates or overestimates the CGP without AI, as the estimation bias increases, the retailer becomes more inclined to adopt AI; however, an increase in the unit adoption cost will discourage adoption. Furthermore, we find that if the retailer underestimates the CGP without AI, adopting AI may negatively impact the profits of both the manufacturer and the supply chain, as well as the greenness level, while simultaneously enhancing social welfare. Conversely, if the CGP is overestimated, adopting AI can improve the manufacturer’s profit and the supply chain’s profit but decrease the greenness level and potentially harm social welfare. We extend the model by considering the prediction accuracy of AI, demonstrating that as the prediction accuracy increases, the retailer who underestimates the CGP without AI becomes more inclined to adopt AI; however, this may not hold under certain conditions if the CGP is overestimated.}

Second, this paper examines the policies and regulations on GAI from 24 countries as samples. Employing the fsQCA and NCA method, along with PMC index evaluation results, this paper explores potential pathways to enhance the governance efficiency of GAI policies and regulations. Third, the configurational pathway analysis of governance efficiency in GAI policies and regulations identifies six critical influencing factors: policy and regulatory quality, government actions, venture capital investment, AI governance capacities, public stakeholder engagement, and AI safety mechanisms. Finally, through necessity analysis, configurational analysis, and robustness testing of these six factors, the paper reveals that technology-resource driven, policy-actor coordinated, and government-resource mediated implementation configurations can effectively achieve high-level governance efficiency in GAI policies and regulations. Therefore, it provides a reference for optimizing the governance practice of GAI policies and regulations.}

abstract = {Among various clinical skills, critical thinking (CT) is foundational for quality patient care. However, existing literature suggests deficiencies in applying analytical reasoning skills in healthcare education. As CT integration gains momentum in dentistry, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies introduces new dynamics. This article explores the potential impacts of emerging technologies of AI on the development and application of CT in the dental profession.
Methods
A narrative literature review of English-language publications was conducted using sources such as PubMed, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Wiley-Online-Library, and Oral-Health-Group. Our review focused on relevant articles published up to June 30,2024, representing a peak period of CT awareness. The search terms used included: “Critical thinking,” “healthcare,” “rubric,” “dental education,” and “Artificial intelligence.” No inclusion or exclusion criteria were applied. The search strategies aimed to synthesize collective healthcare experience in implementing CT in education, providing a cohesive understanding of the current state of CT and highlighting gaps in its integration in education.
Results
Strategies for incorporating CT into dental education are still developing. Although dental educators recognize the importance of CT-based curricula, barriers hinder effective implementation. Additionally, the rise of advanced technologies with human-like cognitive and non-cognitive capabilities necessitates agile, adaptable strategies to integrate CT in dental education. A simplified model is proposed for integrating AI into the development of CT skills at multiple levels in dental education. Furthermore, a rubric for assessing CT skills in problem-based learning is presented.
Conclusion
This review emphasizes the urgent need to strategically prioritize CT integration in dental education. Inadequate application of CT may increase the risk of AI misuse, and overreliance on AI could potentially undermine clinical decision-making. We propose that emerging technologies should be embraced as tools to enhance the development of CT skills while mitigating potential negative impacts. Plausible approaches to addressing this challenge are outlined.}

abstract = {Background
Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has demonstrated the feasibility of using HAP-water to respond to BMD changes without requiring dedicated software or calibration. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been utilized for diagnosising osteoporosis in routine CT scans but has rarely been used in DECT. This study investigated the diagnostic performance of an AI system for osteoporosis screening using DECT images with reference quantitative CT (QCT).
Methods
This prospective study included 120 patients who underwent DECT and QCT scans from August to December 2023. Two convolutional neural networks, 3D RetinaNet and U-Net, were employed for automated vertebral body segmentation. The accuracy of the bone mineral density (BMD) measurement was assessed with relative measurement error (RME%). Linear regression and Bland–Altman analyses were performed to compare the BMD values between the AI and manual systems with those of the QCT. The diagnostic performance of the AI and manual systems for osteoporosis and low BMD was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.
Results
The overall mean RME% for the AI and manual systems were − 15.93 ± 12.05 % and − 25.47 ± 14.83 %, respectively. BMD measurements using the AI system achieved greater agreement with the QCT results than those using the manual system (R2 = 0.973, 0.948, p < 0.001; mean errors, 23.27, 35.71 mg/cm3; 95 % LoA, −9.72 to 56.26, −11.45 to 82.87 mg/cm3). The areas under the curve for the AI and manual systems were 0.979 and 0.933 for detecting osteoporosis and 0.980 and 0.991 for low BMD.
Conclusion
This AI system could achieve relatively high accuracy for automated BMD measurement on DECT scans, providing great potential for the follow-up of BMD in osteoporosis screening.}
