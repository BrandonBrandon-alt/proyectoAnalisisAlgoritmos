abstract = {This article introduces a framework for optimizing managerial decisions through a process/flow thinking approach, incorporating the impact of AI-human socialization in a tourism organizational context. It reflects the transformative nature of hybrid interactions shaped by human-AI socialization process. Despite AI's expansion across industries, research on its social integration in tourism remains limited. This study critically reviews sociotechnical systems theory and applies a continuous socio-technological transformation approach to tourism organizations. The proposed framework conceptualizes decision-making in a human-agentic AI hybrid system via implementation of Intelligent Choice Architectures, emphasizing teamwork, trust-building, and legitimacy. An example case on pricing optimization illustrates the framework's applicability, demonstrating how AI can enhance decision-making in tourism, while streamlining allocation of resources across the human-AI hybrid system.}

The objective is to enhance the predictive accuracy of market behavior through improved understanding of investor sentiment. The proposed sentiment analysis framework leverages six domain-specific datasets: Social Sentiment Indices (X-Scores), Fin-SoMe, SemEval-2017 Task 5, Fin-Lin, Sanders, and Taborda. These datasets, primarily sourced from social media, reflect diverse investor perspectives. Generative AI models, like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, are used to create more data, and the meaning of words is enhanced using techniques like BERT and Word2Vec. The model is trained with a cross-entropy loss function and fine-tuned using Few-shot Learning, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, and ReAct strategies, ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results show consistent improvements across all datasets in accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score. The use of generative AI and transformer architectures makes the model stronger and better at understanding how investors feel in real financial situations. This research contributes to the field of explicable AI in finance by demonstrating the impact of domain-adapted models and generative techniques in advancing sentiment analysis. The findings offer practical value for investors and analysts seeking data-driven insights into market dynamics and decision-making processes.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform cancer diagnosis, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.
Objective
We performed an umbrella review to summarize and critically evaluate the evidence for the AI-based imaging diagnosis of cancers.
Methods
PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, and IEEE databases were searched for relevant systematic reviews from inception to June 19, 2024. Two independent investigators abstracted data and assessed the quality of evidence, using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses. We further assessed the quality of evidence in each meta-analysis by applying the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Diagnostic performance data were synthesized narratively.
Results
In a comprehensive analysis of 158 included studies evaluating the performance of AI algorithms in noninvasive imaging diagnosis across 8 major human system cancers, the accuracy of the classifiers for central nervous system cancers varied widely (ranging from 48% to 100%). Similarities were observed in the diagnostic performance for cancers of the head and neck, respiratory system, digestive system, urinary system, female-related systems, skin, and other sites. Most meta-analyses demonstrated positive summary performance. For instance, 9 reviews meta-analyzed sensitivity and specificity for esophageal cancer, showing ranges of 90%-95% and 80%-93.8%, respectively. In the case of breast cancer detection, 8 reviews calculated the pooled sensitivity and specificity within the ranges of 75.4%-92% and 83%-90.6%, respectively. Four meta-analyses reported the ranges of sensitivity and specificity in ovarian cancer, and both were 75%-94%. Notably, in lung cancer, the pooled specificity was relatively low, primarily distributed between 65% and 80%. Furthermore, 80.4% (127/158) of the included studies were of high quality according to the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist, with the remaining studies classified as medium quality. The GRADE assessment indicated that the overall quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
Conclusions
Although AI shows great potential for achieving accelerated, accurate, and more objective diagnoses of multiple cancers, there are still hurdles to overcome before its implementation in clinical settings. The present findings highlight that a concerted effort from the research community, clinicians, and policymakers is required to overcome existing hurdles and translate this potential into improved patient outcomes and health care delivery.

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been increasingly used in urban planning to tackle complex urban population growth and socioeconomic demands. AI data-driven methodologies have transformative potential for decision-making and policymaking in urban governance. However, a gap exists between AI’s theoretical promises and its practical integration into governance frameworks. While smart cities highlight technological advancements, they also expose socio-political challenges such as inclusivity, ethics, and public trust. This study systematically reviews literature on AI adoption in urban planning and governance, examining decision-making advancements and the socio-political dimensions of AI integration. Unlike previous studies, our review connects technological innovation with governance contexts, offering a nuanced analysis of AI’s role in urban systems. The findings show that AI research in urban governance is concentrated in Europe, North America, and Asia, with Africa and Central America being underrepresented. Since 2020, AI research has surged due to smart city initiatives but remains mostly theoretical with limited practical applications in urban governance. Additionally, AI’s integration with public administration and urban studies is minimal, raising concerns about equity and transparency in algorithmic decision-making. By identifying these gaps and challenges, this study provides actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and researchers. Inclusive governance frameworks that balance technological innovation with ethical and sociopolitical considerations are recommended, to ensure that AI-driven urban development promotes equitable, efficient, and sustainable outcomes.}

Therefore, people's perspectives about this transformative change involving creativity and art must be examined. We investigated attitudes toward using AI in art from the perspective of self-determination theory. We used data from a two-wave survey of Finnish respondents aged 18–80 years (n = 828) to analyze within- and between-person effects using hybrid multilevel regression modelling. We measured positive attitudes toward using AI in (a) the art and culture field in general, (b) music, (c) visual arts, (d) detecting forged art, and (e) creating art. The main independent variables were the basic psychological needs (perceived relatedness, autonomy, and competence) in using new technologies. The results showed that participants were less positive toward using AI in the art and culture field in general compared to many other fields, such as medicine and building and real estate technology. Stronger relatedness had within- and between-person effects on positive attitudes on using AI in the art and culture field in general, as well as in music, visual arts, and creating art. Stronger autonomy had within- and between-person effects on positive attitudes on using AI in detecting forged art and creating art. The results indicate that human needs for relatedness and autonomy are important in attitudes toward using AI in art. Hence, positive personal experiences with the use of new technology are likely to affect how people perceive the introduction of AI to the art field, which has been considered the last human frontier in the technological world.}

Using a sample of 200 participants (55 % male; mean age = 25.01, SD = 4.20), the research employed a 2 × 2 between-subjects design to examine the impact of tutor type (avatar vs. audio) and tutor gender (male vs. female) on user perceptions and acceptance. Findings revealed that audio-based tutors were rated more positively in dimensions such as anthropomorphism, animation, and intention to use. Gender congruence between participants and tutors also influenced perceptions, with female participants rating female audio tutors as safer and more anthropomorphic. Regression analyses highlighted that openness to experience and personal innovativeness in technology were significant predictors of positive evaluations, particularly regarding tutor sympathy and perceived usefulness. These results underscore the challenges associated with humanoid avatars, including the “Uncanny Valley” effect, which may reduce user acceptance and engagement. The study suggests that audio-based AI interfaces may be more effective in promoting positive user experiences, emphasizing the need for tailored design strategies in AI-driven educational tools.

This shapes the reform trajectory of equity structures in State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), offering SOEs—typically viewed as weaker innovators—an opportunity to keep pace in the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we investigate the role of equity diversification in shaping SOEs’ AI innovation performance. Using the patent and equity structure data of Chinese listed SOEs during 2007–2023, we find that a 1% increase in equity diversification is associated with a 0.05% boost in AI patent applications filed by SOEs in the next year. This positive effect is achieved through: (i) reducing managerial short-termism and encouraging long-term strategic investments, (ii) directing managerial attention to emerging technologies like AI, and (iii) facilitating external learning and improving innovation efficiency. SOEs in the growth or maturity stage, operating in high-tech or competitive industries, and characterized by financial adequacy and commercial orientations benefit more from equity diversification. Additionally, this benefit is limited to AI innovation output, without affecting its quality or traditional innovation.}

abstract = {Background
The rise of high-definition imaging and robotic surgery has independently been associated with improved postoperative outcomes. However, steep learning curves and finite human cognitive ability limit the facility in imaging interpretation and interaction with the robotic surgery console interfaces. This review presents innovative ways in which artificial intelligence integrates preoperative imaging and surgery to help overcome these limitations and to further advance robotic operations.
Methods
PubMed was queried for “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning,” and “robotic surgery.” From the 182 publications in English, a further in-depth review of the cited literature was performed.
Results
Artificial intelligence boasts efficiency and proclivity for large amounts of unwieldy and unstructured data. Its wide adoption has significant practice-changing implications throughout the perioperative period. Assessment of preoperative imaging can augment preoperative surgeon knowledge by accessing pathology data that have been traditionally only available postoperatively through analysis of preoperative imaging. Intraoperatively, the interaction of artificial intelligence with augmented reality through the dynamic overlay of preoperative anatomical knowledge atop the robotic operative field can outline safe dissection planes, helping surgeons make critical real-time intraoperative decisions. Finally, semi-independent artificial intelligence–assisted robotic operations may one day be performed by artificial intelligence with limited human intervention.
Conclusion
As artificial intelligence has allowed machines to think and problem-solve like humans, it promises further advancement of existing technologies and a revolution of individualized patient care. Further research and ethical precautions are necessary before the full implementation of artificial intelligence in robotic surgery.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a revolutionary tool yet to be fully integrated into several health care sectors, including medical imaging. AI can transform how medical imaging is conducted and interpreted, especially in cardio-oncology.
Objective
This study aims to systematically review the available literature on the use of AI in cardio-oncology imaging to predict cardiotoxicity and describe the possible improvement of different imaging modalities that can be achieved if AI is successfully deployed to routine practice.
Methods
We conducted a database search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Google Scholar from inception to 2023 using the AI research assistant tool (Elicit) to search for original studies reporting AI outcomes in adult patients diagnosed with any cancer and undergoing cardiotoxicity assessment. Outcomes included incidence of cardiotoxicity, left ventricular ejection fraction, risk factors associated with cardiotoxicity, heart failure, myocardial dysfunction, signs of cancer therapy–related cardiovascular toxicity, echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Descriptive information about each study was recorded, including imaging technique, AI model, outcomes, and limitations.
Results
The systematic search resulted in 7 studies conducted between 2018 and 2023, which are included in this review. Most of these studies were conducted in the United States (71%), included patients with breast cancer (86%), and used magnetic resonance imaging as the imaging modality (57%). The quality assessment of the studies had an average of 86% compliance in all of the tool’s sections. In conclusion, this systematic review demonstrates the potential of AI to enhance cardio-oncology imaging for predicting cardiotoxicity in patients with cancer.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that AI can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cardiotoxicity assessments. However, further research through larger, multicenter trials is needed to validate these applications and refine AI technologies for routine use, paving the way for improved patient outcomes in cancer survivors at risk of cardiotoxicity.

The high mortality rate is concerning, and tumour heterogeneity at the genetic, phenotypic, and pathological levels exacerbates the problem. In this context, lack of early diagnostic techniques and therapeutic resistance to drugs, sole awareness among the public, coupled with the unavailability of these modern technologies in developing and low-income countries, negatively impact cancer management. One of the prime necessities of the world today is the enhancement of early detection of cancers. Several independent studies have shown that screening individuals for cancer can improve patient survival but are bogged down by risk classification and major problems in patient selection. Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced the field of oncology, addressing various medical challenges, particularly in cancer management. Leveraging extensive medical datasets and innovative computational technologies, AI, especially through deep learning (DL), has found applications across multiple facets of oncology research. These applications range from early cancer detection, diagnosis, classification, and grading, molecular characterization of tumours, prediction of patient outcomes and treatment responses, personalized treatment, and novel anti-cancer drug discovery. Over the past decade, AI/ML has emerged as a valuable tool in cancer prognosis, risk assessment, and treatment selection for cancer patients. Several patents have been and are being filed and granted. Some of those inventions were explored and are being explored in clinical settings as well. In this review, we will discuss the current status, recent advancements, clinical trials, challenges, and opportunities associated with AI/ML applications in cancer detection and management. We are optimistic about the potential of AI/ML in improving outcomes for cancer and the need for further research and development in this field.}

The solution showed an optimal viscosity of 330.87 mPa s, surface tension of 41.76 dyne/cm, and electrical conductivity of 10004.78 μs/cm. The electrospinning process was meticulously optimized, with a flow rate of 0.2 mL/h, a voltage of 25 kV, 40 % humidity, and a needle-to-collector distance of 15 cm. An AI model was employed to predict the nanofiber diameter, demonstrating exceptional predictive accuracy. The formulated pomegranate and collagen nanofibers mat was tested in-vivo and showed significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and tissue-regenerative properties, restoring SOD and collagen levels, reducing MMP-1, COX-2, and PGE-2 levels, and effectively attenuating NF-κB activation, highlighting the therapeutic potential of the formulated mats for managing skin aging. This study provides novel insights into the integration of QbD and AI for the development of natural product-based formulations, paving the way for their application in advanced pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical systems.}

abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (gAI) models, such as DALL-E 2, are promising tools that can generate novel images or artwork based on text input. However, caution is warranted, as these tools generate information based on historical data and are thus at risk of propagating past learned inequities. Women in medicine have routinely been underrepresented in academic and clinical medicine and the stereotype of a male physician persists.
Objective
The primary objective is to evaluate implicit bias among gAI across medical specialties.
Methods
To evaluate for potential implicit bias, 100 photographs for each medical specialty were generated using the gAI platform DALL-E2. For each specialty, DALL-E2 was queried with “An American [specialty name].” Our primary endpoint was to compare the gender distribution of gAI photos to the current distribution in the United States. Our secondary endpoint included evaluating the racial distribution. gAI photos were classified according to perceived gender and race based on a unanimous consensus among a diverse group of medical residents. The proportion of gAI women subjects was compared for each medical specialty to the most recent Association of American Medical Colleges report for physician workforce and active residents using χ2 analysis.
Results
A total of 1900 photos across 19 medical specialties were generated. Compared to physician workforce data, AI significantly overrepresented women in 7/19 specialties and underrepresented women in 6/19 specialties. Women were significantly underrepresented compared to the physician workforce by 18%, 18%, and 27% in internal medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics, respectively. Compared to current residents, AI significantly underrepresented women in 12/19 specialties, ranging from 10% to 36%. Additionally, women represented <50% of the demographic for 17/19 specialties by gAI.
Conclusions
gAI created a sample population of physicians that underrepresented women when compared to both the resident and active physician workforce. Steps must be taken to train datasets in order to represent the diversity of the incoming physician workforce.}

This study investigates the impact of an AI-supported occupational therapy program, developed using the Model of Human Occupation (MOHO), on handwriting skills in children at risk for Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD).
Method
A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 42 children aged 8–12 years, identified as being at risk for DCD using the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (DCDQ). Participants were randomized into an intervention group (n = 21) and a control group (n = 21). The intervention group received an AI-supported occupational therapy program twice weekly for 8 weeks. Handwriting performance was assessed pre- and post-intervention using the Minnesota Handwriting Assessment (MHA).
Results
Significant improvements were observed in the intervention group across all MHA subdomains, including writing speed, alignment, size, spacing, shape, and legibility (p < 0.001). The most pronounced improvements were in shape (d=2.279), alignment (d=1.893), and the total score (d=2.291). In contrast, the control group showed minimal changes, with significant improvement observed only in alignment (p = 0.006; d=0.311). Between-group comparisons demonstrated superior performance in the intervention group across all subdomains (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
This study highlights the transformative potential of AI-supported occupational therapy programs in addressing the multifaceted challenges of handwriting rehabilitation in children at risk for DCD.}

This study investigates the influential external factors that drive the acceptance of AI technologies in the building industry through a Meta-Analytic Structural Equation Modeling. The analysis reveals that perceived usefulness plays a mediating role (β = 0.812, p < 0.01) between external factors and stakeholders’ intention to adopt AI solutions. Notably, personal factors (β = 0.686, p < 0.01) significantly influence the perception of AI’s usefulness, thereby shaping stronger adoption intentions. Model fit indices also have been included to reflect the robustness of the structural relationships (CFI = 0.741; RMSEA = 0.042). The findings provide guidance for practitioners and policymakers aiming to accelerate AI integration in building environments. These are influential factors that foster user readiness, increase hedonic motivation, and reduce technology-related anxiety to support effective and sustainable AI transition.

However, delegating decisions to AI is challenging, especially in contexts that go beyond classical optimization problems. Current research has so far largely neglected to include the viewpoints of the decision-affected and of surrogate decision-makers in the discussion. To address these gaps, in this study we rely on two experimental designs and complement our findings with qualitative interview data to shed light on both sides: the perspective of those affected by the decision and that of the decision maker in surrogate and ethically complex decision contexts. Findings reveal that the individual decision-making perspective may lead to opposing perceptions. Whereas the willingness to delegate an ethically challenging decision to AI in a surrogate decision context is lower than that in a non-surrogate context (decision-maker perspective), people affected by the decision do not generally prefer humans to AI (decision-affected perspective). By these findings, we contribute to the literature on AI-enabled decision-making and decision delegation to non-human entities.}

The methodology used is based upon selection of publications and analysis. Regarding LCA/AI models, the results show that AI can anticipate environmental impacts but model performance depends on the amount of data available. LCA/AI models can be used for eco-design and decision-making. However, it is necessary to develop standardised methodologies to evaluate AI environmental impacts. Regarding AI and photovoltaics, AI provides remarkably interesting applications: design, optimisation and prediction of parameters related to different kinds of photovoltaics (concentrating, building-integrated, etc.). As for AI and smart grids, AI offers advantages such as integration of intermittent renewable energy sources and decentralised-grid management. With respect to AI and small-island economies, factors such as effective energy storage, energy plans and estimation of the degree of susceptibility to disasters are important. Generally speaking, and considering the above-mentioned issues, it can be argued that AI poses multiple challenges: machine-learning models on a large-scale basis; the internet of things; options to reduce negative environmental impacts and so on.}

abstract = {Chemical process control is traditionally one of the most mathematically demanding courses in the chemical engineering curriculum. Students need to master ordinary differential equations (ODEs), Laplace transforms, transfer functions and proportional‑integral‑derivative (PID) controller design. At Villanova University we developed a pilot project to integrate artificial‑intelligence assistance throughout the process‑control pipeline. Three modules were created: (1) Python coding for ODE simulation, (2) Laplace and inverse Laplace transforms with transfer‑function parameter estimation, and (3) PID controller tuning. For each module, pre-class videos and handouts introduced theoretical concepts and demonstrated example code. Students reviewed these materials before class, and class time was used primarily for answering questions and clarifying concepts. Most project work was completed independently outside of class. Students were instructed to ask a large‑language‑model chatbot (ChatGPT) to explain equations, generate and debug Python code, and interpret the physical meaning of models. Pre‑class handouts and videos prepared students for both in-class and independent practice, and anonymous surveys measured learning impact and students’ overall experience. Fifty-nine students completed all three modules and responded to a 15-question survey, which included 13 multiple-choice rating questions and 2 open-ended questions. The rating questions were grouped into categories measuring students’ confidence in Python coding, understanding of ODE modeling and process control concepts, ability to use AI tools effectively, and perceived applicability of the skills to real-world problems. Responses were scored on a five-point scale, where a rating of 5 indicated the most positive feedback. Statistical analysis showed mean ratings ranging from 3.28 to 4.36, with the highest confidence gain reported in the category assessing the ability to apply the learned skills to real-world problems. Qualitative comments reveal that students valued the novelty of using AI tools but desired clearer instructions and more coding guidance. This study demonstrates a fully integrated approach to AI-assisted education in chemical process control, spanning ODE modeling, Laplace transform, transfer functions, and controller tuning within a single coherent framework. By combining Python-based coding in Google Colab with structured AI interaction strategies, the work bridges theoretical concepts and practical applications across the entire modeling–control pipeline. This project offers an example for AI-based control and engineering education studies.}

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in scientific writing is rapidly increasing, raising concerns about authorship identification, content quality, and writing efficiency.
Objectives
This study investigates the real-world impact of ChatGPT, a large language model, on those aspects in a simulated publication scenario.
Methods
Forty-eight individuals representing 3 medical expertise levels (medical students, residents, and experts in allergy or dermatology) evaluated 3 blinded versions of an atopic dermatitis case report: one each human written (HUM), AI generated (AI), and combined written (COM). The survey assessed authorship, ranked their preference, and graded 13 quality criteria for each text. Time taken to generate each manuscript was also recorded.
Results
Authorship identification accuracy mirrored the odds at 33%. Expert participants (50.9%) demonstrated significantly higher accuracy compared to residents (27.7%) and students (19.6%, P < .001). Participants favored AI-assisted versions (AI and COM) over HUM (P < .001), with COM receiving the highest quality scores. COM and AI achieved 83.8% and 84.3% reduction in writing time, respectively, compared to HUM, while showing 13.9% (P < .001) and 11.1% improvement in quality (P < .001), respectively. However, experts assigned the lowest score for the references of the AI manuscript, potentially hindering its publication.
Conclusion
AI can deceptively mimic human writing, particularly for less experienced readers. Although AI-assisted writing is appealing and offers significant time savings, human oversight remains crucial to ensure accuracy, ethical considerations, and optimal quality. These findings underscore the need for transparency in AI use and highlight the potential of human-AI collaboration in the future of scientific writing.}

Further, we also studied AI readiness and its influence on business ethics and SS, which we measured through skill development, work conditions, environment, and safety among MSMEs. We collected the data from 236 MSME employees. We used Structural Equation Modeling using SmartPLS software for data analysis. The research findings indicated that AI readiness directly impacts SS. We also found that the findings directly impact employees' social and ethical behavior. We also observed that business ethics significantly affects SS, indicating partial mediation. This study has substantial theoretical and managerial implications as policymakers and MSME leadership need to consider SS an essential component of sustainable development.}

Current digital literacy frameworks lack AI-specific competencies, resulting in inconsistencies in the assessment of AI competence. This study aims to establish a standardized assessment framework for Generative AI competence by identifying key skill factors and empirically validating a structured evaluation tool called the Generative AI Competence Scale (GenAIComp). The proposed GenAIComp has five essential factors: Information and Data Literacy, Communication and Collaboration, Digital Content Creation, Safety and Ethics, and Problem-Solving. A quantitative approach was employed, incorporating expert validation, pilot testing, and extensive empirical evaluation involving 1000 participants, principally university students. The factor analysis confirmed a robust 5-factor structure with strong psychometric properties. The final model demonstrated excellent fit indices, confirming its reliability and validity in assessing Generative AI competence across the five key factors. Research demonstrates that educational background considerably impacts AI competence, with individuals from technical disciplines showing a greater aptitude for problem-solving and content generation. Gender-based disparities were noted, with males achieving marginally higher scores in several factors, but with minimal effect sizes. Correlation analysis indicated that perceived AI expertise and frequency of AI utilization significantly influenced competence, especially in data literacy and problem-solving, and exhibited less correlation with ethical awareness. GenAIComp provides a reliable tool for assessing AI competence, helping educators, industry experts, and policymakers to design AI training programs and integrate AI literacy into curricula and thereby AI technology advancement in society. Future research should explore its applicability across cultures and include performance-based assessments to enhance AI competence.}

However, a significant gap exists in understanding how AI-based learning in higher education curricula influences graduates' readiness and commitment to be accountants. Addressing this gap, this study aims to answer two pivotal questions: how do AI learning experiences affect AI self-efficacy and career commitment, and how do literacy, motivations, and competency factors mediate this relationship? This study grounds in Self-determination Theory (SDT) and Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) to answer the questions and utilizes a multiple mediation model with partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze survey data gathered from 698 fresh graduates in accounting and finance program across the country (Indonesia). The finding confirms that AI-based learning experiences in higher education influence fresh graduates’ AI self-efficacy and career commitment through the mediating role of AI literacy, competency, and motivations. This study demonstrates that AI-based learning enhances students' literacy and competencies in AI/accounting software while boosting intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to master AI skills for future career benefits. Ultimately, increased motivation, literacy, and competencies strengthen graduates' self-efficacy and confidence, supporting their commitment to a career in accounting. This study, therefore, contributes a novel insight by providing empirical considerations for higher education and the accounting industry to strengthen AI-based curricula for future workforce supply.}

The multifactorial nature of AD, shaped by genetic, environmental, and biological factors, complicates both research and clinical management. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and multi-omics technologies provide new opportunities to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of AD and identify early biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. AI-driven approaches such as machine learning, deep learning, and network-based models have enabled the integration of large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and microbiomic datasets. These efforts have facilitated the discovery of novel molecular signatures and therapeutic targets. Methods including deep belief networks and joint deep semi-non-negative matrix factorization have contributed to improvements in disease classification and patient stratification. However, ongoing challenges remain. These include data heterogeneity, limited interpretability of complex models, a lack of large and diverse datasets, and insufficient clinical validation. The absence of standardized multi-omics data processing methods further restricts progress.

This review explores the role artificial intelligence has had on cardiac imaging, electrophysiology, interventional procedures, and intensive care monitoring as it relates to children and adults with congenital heart disease. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have enhanced not only imaging segmentation and processing but also diagnostic accuracy namely reducing interobserver variability. This has a meaningful impact in complex congenital heart disease improving anatomic diagnosis, assessment of cardiac function, and predicting long-term outcomes. Image processing has benefited procedural planning for interventional cardiology, allowing for a higher quality and density of information to be extracted from the same imaging modalities. In electrophysiology, deep learning models have enhanced the diagnostic potential of electrocardiograms, detecting subtle yet meaningful variation in signals that enable early diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction, risk stratification of mortality, and more accurate diagnosis and prediction of arrhythmias. In the congenital heart disease population, this has the potential for meaningful prolongation of life. Postoperative care in the cardiac intensive care unit is a data-rich environment that is often overwhelming. Detection of subtle data trends in this environment for early detection of morbidity is a ripe avenue for artificial intelligence algorithms to be used. Examples like early detection of catheter-induced thrombosis have already been published. Despite their great promise, artificial intelligence algorithms are still limited by hurdles such as data standardization, algorithm validation, drift, and explainability.}

abstract = {During coal mining process, water inrush accidents primarily occur in the stage of roadway excavation and it accounts for approximately 70 %. At present, the most effective method is the mine transient electromagnetic advanced sounding for detecting water rich zones ahead of roadway excavation. Currently, the primary data processing technique for mine transient electromagnetic detected data is the fan shaped apparent resistivity method. However, it cannot meet the demands of coal mine geological transparency and precise mining. Besides, coal mine roadways are located in the three dimensional space and traditional transient electromagnetic 3D inversion involves massive computational quantity and it consumes a long computation time. Hence, it also cannot meet the requirement of rapid processing and real-time monitoring. Machine learning inversion algorithms can learn from large datasets and it can quickly identify target bodies. Based on coal mine hydrogeological characteristics, 1500 coal mine hydrogeological models were established to train sample data. Besides, finite volume method is employed to calculate mine transient electromagnetic responses to form sample database. During the 3D forward modeling of coal mine transient electromagnetic, three scenarios of coal mine hydrogeological geology are considered and they are disaster geological bodies located in the coal seam, floor and roof, respectively. Moreover, a 3D convolutional neural network was developed to conduct three-dimensional inversion calculations for transient electromagnetic data in coal mines. Furthermore, the comparison between the forward model and the inversion results have been done and it demonstrates the feasibility of machine learning for 3D inversion in transient electromagnetic applications within mines. Finally, machine learning inversion was conducted by field data from Huaibei coal mining and the inversion results were generally consistent with information of drilling geology. Hence, the field data inversion demonstrates its effectiveness. Additionally, the total inversion time was 485 milliseconds and it is less than one second. All in all, this high inversion speed lays the foundation for real-time processing and intelligent detection of transient electromagnetic signals in the coal mine.}

To systematically evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, educational utility, and communication potential of generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, in otolaryngology.
Data Sources
A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore identified English-language peer-reviewed studies from January 2022 to March 2025.
Review Methods
Eligible studies evaluated text-based generative AI models used in otolaryngology. Two reviewers screened and assessed studies using JBI and QUADAS-2 tools. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted on diagnostic accuracy outcomes, with subgroup analyses by task type and model version.
Results
Ninety-one studies were included; 61 reported quantitative outcomes. Of these, 43 provided diagnostic accuracy data across 59 model-task pairs. Pooled diagnostic accuracy was 72.7 % (95 % CI: 67.4–77.6 %; I² = 93.8 %). Accuracy was highest in education (83.0 %) and diagnostic imaging tasks (84.9 %), and lowest in clinical decision support (67.1 %). GPT-4 consistently outperformed GPT-3.5 across both education and CDS domains. Hallucinations and performance variability were noted in complex clinical reasoning tasks.
Conclusion
Generative AI performs well in structured otolaryngology tasks, particularly education and communication. However, its inconsistent performance in clinical reasoning tasks limits standalone use. Future research should focus on hallucination mitigation, standardized evaluation, and prospective validation to guide safe clinical integration.}

abstract = {Natural language processing, with parsing and generation, has a long tradition. Parsing has been easier to perform than a generation but with generative artificial intelligence (a.k.a Gen AI) and large language models (abbr. LLMs), this has changed. Generative artificial intelligence is a type of artificial intelligence that uses a large data set to create something in the genre of that data set. It can generate different outputs ranging from texts, audio, objects, pictures, and paintings to videos, but also synthetic data. LLMs use deep learning and deep neural networks to train on large text corpora for recognizing and generating texts. These models are based on massive data sets, collected from databases and the web. They use transformer models to detect how elements in sequences relate to each other. This provides context support. Two well-known large language models are the Generative Pre-trained Transformer, GPT, used in ChatGPT and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, BERT. Although LLMs have advantages, they have problems. This paper presents generative artificial intelligence and LLMs with benefits and drawbacks. Results from applying these models have shown that they can work well for accuracy in specificity, user personalization and human-computer communication but they may not provide acceptable, reliable and truthful results. For example, ethics, hallucinations and incorrect information, or misjudgments, are some major problems. The paper ends with future directions, research questions on LLMs, and recommendations.}

abstract = {Food security is a critical challenge of the 21st century, increasingly exacerbated by climate change, which facilitates the spread of pests on farms. The South American tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick), represents a significant global threat to tomato crops. Rising infestations have led to the extensive use of insecticides, raising concerns about pesticide resistance, human health risks, and environmental contamination. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) provides real-time, scalable, and cost-effective alternatives to traditional pest detection methods, which are labour-intensive and prone to human error. As a result, this study comprehensively assesses the potential of AI in the early detection and mitigation of Tuta absoluta-induced tomato leaf diseases. A systematic literature review was conducted across four major academic databases: ScienceDirect, Scopus, ACM, and IEEE. After a rigorous screening process, 115 studies were selected from an initial pool of 178 papers based on the relevance of their methodologies. This paper synthesises current research on AI methodologies, pest detection technologies, and their agricultural applications for the early detection, identification, and management of Tuta absoluta-induced tomato leaf diseases. Beyond tomato crops, the findings offer broader implications for managing similar pests affecting other economically significant crops. The study concludes with actionable recommendations for integrating AI-driven pest detection into precision agriculture, with the goal of enhancing food security and promoting sustainable farming practices worldwide.}

Constructing representative DCs has been widely studied with well-known methods. However, challenges remain regarding the reproducibility of results and the need for a large set of sampled trips, which can be costly and time-consuming. This work presents a novel approach to constructing DCs using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). A multi-objective training approach incorporates model-based losses represented by discriminators to capture time-series trends of speed, acceleration, and jerk, and function-based losses to ensure that the generator respects physical constraints. These losses are activated sequentially according to a convergence measure that utilizes the Characteristic Parameters (CPs) of the generated DCs for the latest activated loss. A new loss is activated if the convergence measure is lower than a threshold. An early stopping mechanism can be triggered when the threshold condition is met at the last loss. The DC generator was validated comparing the artificial trips with real trips from four cities. This comparison involved computing the Relative Difference (RD) between the CPs. The results indicate that the approach can achieve less than a 10% RD, thus providing superior results than a classical approach, a vanilla GAN, and other variations. Additionally, the threshold-based loss activation led to a reduction in training time. Transfer Learning (TL) was employed to construct DCs for other regions. This approach reduces the need for extensive data collection and ensures the reproducibility of artificial DCs.}

Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), as a representative of disruptive technological innovation, has reshaped traditional manufacturing processes and opened up a field of possibilities. This paper analyzes the practice of GAI technology in the production process and explores its interaction with product line design under two predominant distribution contracts. We focus on technological innovation factors, such as the impact of GAI technology on product popularity and the probability of a successful GAI-assisted design, and find that the effect of GAI technology on product popularity exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with both product quality and firm profit. Our work also demonstrates that a longer product line could incentivize the supplier to adopt GAI-assisted product design under both agency and wholesale contracts. We also show that GAI technology motivates the supplier to extend its product line. Finally, our extended analysis examines distribution contract choices in the presence of GAI technology and reveals that the platform favors an agency contract over a wholesale contract when the commission rate is either relatively low or high, the impact of GAI technology on product popularity is low, the probability of a successful GAI-assisted design is high, and the product line extension fee is moderate.}

From the features like vibration, temperature of the motor, pressure, and flow rate, the models categorize the state of the pump into two; normal or No Fault, and Fault Detected. This makes it possible to detect specific faults and assist in creating preventive maintenance. Post analysis, it was inferred that with an accuracy of 0.92, the SVM with a linear kernel outperformed the competing models. While the KNN performed marginally worse with an accuracy of 0.85, the SVM with RBF and polynomial kernels as well as logistic regression both attained accuracy of 0.91. These findings highlight the SVM with a linear kernel’s superior generalization skills, which make it the best option for pump system defect identification. For defect detection, giving the SVM with a linear kernel priority guarantees precise predictions, allowing for proactive maintenance and minimizing downtime. To improve operational efficiency and lower long-term maintenance costs, policy ideas include standardizing data collection techniques, investing in real-time monitoring systems, and implementing machine learning-based predictive maintenance across industries.}

abstract = {Carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) is a promising solution to decarbonize the energy and industrial sectors to mitigate climate change. An integrated assessment of technological options is required for the effective deployment of CCUS large-scale infrastructure between CO2 production and utilization/sequestration nodes. However, developing cost-effective strategies from engineering and operation perspectives to implement CCUS is challenging. This is due to the diversity of upstream emitting processes located in different geographical areas, available downstream utilization technologies, storage sites capacity/location, and current/future energy/emissions/economic conditions. This paper identifies the need to achieve a robust hybrid assessment tool for CCUS modeling, simulation, and optimization based mainly on artificial intelligence (AI) combined with mechanistic methods. Thus, a critical literature review is conducted to assess CCUS technologies and their related process modeling/simulation/optimization techniques, while evaluating the needs for improvements or new developments to reduce overall CCUS systems design and operation costs. These techniques include first principles- based and data-driven ones, i.e. AI and related machine learning (ML) methods. Besides, the paper gives an overview on the role of life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate CCUS systems where the combined LCA-AI approach is assessed. Other advanced methods based on the AI/ML capabilities/algorithms can be developed to optimize the whole CCUS value chain. Interpretable ML combined with explainable AI can accelerate optimum materials selection by giving strong rules which accelerates the design of capture/utilization plants afterwards. Besides, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) coupled with process simulations will accelerate process design/operation optimization through considering simultaneous optimization of equipment sizing and operating conditions. Moreover, generative deep learning (GDL) is a key solution to optimum capture/utilization materials design/discovery. The developed AI methods can be generalizable where the extracted knowledge can be transferred to future works to help cutting the costs of CCUS value chain.}

To address this gap, this study aims to investigate the role of the AI-assisted New Concept English App as a tool in improving EFL listening. Based on a mixed methods approach, this study invited a total of 89 Chinese university students from three groups to participate in the experiment. Data obtained from five achievement tests and post-session interviews with the participants were collected, processed, and analyzed. The findings reveal that AI-assisted application does not imply a strong advantage in terms of improving overall student achievement in listening, in spite of the fact that the majority of students surveyed advocated embracing and fully using it.}

Background
The internet is a common source of health information for patients. Interactive online artificial intelligence (AI) may be a more reliable source of health-related information than traditional search engines. This study aimed to assess the quality and perceived utility of chat-based AI responses related to 3 common gastrointestinal (GI) surgical procedures.
Methods
A survey of 24 questions covering general perioperative information on cholecystectomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), and colectomy was created. Each question was posed to Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) in June 2023, and the generated responses were recorded. The quality and perceived utility of responses were independently and subjectively graded by expert respondents specific to each surgical field. Grades were classified as “poor,” “fair,” “good,” “very good,” or “excellent.”
Results
Among the 45 respondents (general surgeon [n = 13], surgical oncologist [n = 18], colorectal surgeon [n = 13], and transplant surgeon [n = 1]), most practiced at an academic facility (95.6%). Respondents had been in practice for a mean of 12.3 years (general surgeon, 14.5 ± 7.2; surgical oncologist, 12.1 ± 8.2; colorectal surgeon, 10.2 ± 8.0) and performed a mean 53 index operations annually (cholecystectomy, 47 ± 28; PD, 28 ± 27; colectomy, 81 ± 44). Overall, the most commonly assigned quality grade was “fair” or “good” for most responses (n = 622/1080, 57.6%). Most of the 1080 total utility grades were “fair” (n = 279, 25.8%) or “good” (n = 344, 31.9%), whereas only 129 utility grades (11.9%) were “poor.” Of note, ChatGPT responses related to cholecystectomy (45.3% [“very good”/“excellent”] vs 18.1% [“poor”/“fair”]) were deemed to be better quality than AI responses about PD (18.9% [“very good”/“excellent”] vs 46.9% [“poor”/“fair”]) or colectomy (31.4% [“very good”/“excellent”] vs 38.3% [“poor”/“fair”]). Overall, only 20.0% of the experts deemed ChatGPT to be an accurate source of information, whereas 15.6% of the experts found it unreliable. Moreover, 1 in 3 surgeons deemed ChatGPT responses as not likely to reduce patient-physician correspondence (31.1%) or not comparable to in-person surgeon responses (35.6%).
Conclusions
Although a potential resource for patient education, ChatGPT responses to common GI perioperative questions were deemed to be of only modest quality and utility to patients. In addition, the relative quality of AI responses varied markedly on the basis of procedure type.}

Risk stratification has traditionally been performed using epidemiological studies and genetic analyses, through which key risk factors, including smoking, diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, and inherited predispositions, have been identified. However, the multifactorial nature of PDAC has often been insufficiently addressed by these methods, leading to limited precision in individualized risk assessments. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have been proposed as a transformative approach, allowing the integration of diverse datasets—spanning genetic, clinical, lifestyle, and imaging data into dynamic models capable of uncovering novel interactions and risk profiles. In this review, the evolution of PDAC risk stratification is explored, with classical epidemiological frameworks compared to AI-driven methodologies. Genetic insights, including genome-wide association studies and polygenic risk scores, are discussed, alongside AI models such as machine learning, radiomics, and deep learning. Strengths and limitations of these approaches are evaluated, with challenges in clinical translation, such as data scarcity, model interpretability, and external validation, addressed. Finally, future directions are proposed for combining classical and AI-driven methodologies to develop scalable, personalized predictive tools for PDAC, with the goal of improving early detection and patient outcomes.}

Conventional ED faces challenges such as low ion selectivity and membrane fouling, while Bipolar Membrane ED offers enhanced pH control and lithium recovery but is hindered by high energy consumption and membrane instability. Selective ED improves lithium selectivity using monovalent ion-selective membranes but is limited by high costs, scaling and batch operation. Redox-Couple ED, still in its early stages, requires further development for industrial scalability. The review highlights the importance of optimizing operational parameters, including voltage, current density, pH, flow rate and temperature to enhance ion migration and minimize inefficiencies. A techno-economic analysis shows the potential of ED-based lithium production to be cost-effective, though large-scale viability remains uncertain. Membrane fouling, caused by scale-forming ions, can be mitigated through pretreatment and cleaning methods, but further research is necessary to improve membrane durability and performance. Despite ED's environmental advantages, innovations such as introducing CO2 into the ED catholyte to produce Li2CO3, thereby eliminating the need for sodium carbonate as a precipitator show promise for reducing energy consumption. Finally, research directions on artificial intelligence (AI) for extracting lithium using ED are provided.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) can analyze complex data, reveal patterns, and support predictive modeling to lower costs, shorten timelines, and improve efficiency. This review aims to evaluate how AI can address these barriers by systematically synthesizing its applications in deep geothermal research. A structured Web of Science search and multi-stage screening yielded 183 peer-reviewed journal papers, classified across eight research areas: reservoir characterization, exploration and resource identification, system optimization, seismic monitoring and risk assessment, drilling optimization, hybrid energy systems, environmental impact and sustainability, and techno-economic analysis. Our analysis shows that since 2020, AI applications in geothermal energy have expanded exponentially, surpassing overall AI growth rates. China and the United States dominate research output, followed by Germany, Turkey, Canada, and India. Advanced algorithms are increasingly preferred: convolutional neural networks for spatial modeling and image interpretation, recurrent neural networks for time-series forecasting, physics-informed AI, Bayesian frameworks, and autoencoders advance uncertainty quantification and data reconstruction. The novelty of this review lies in its comprehensive cross-domain synthesis of AI applications in deep geothermal energy, using a unified algorithm–input–output–performance lens. This structured mapping enables comparisons not possible in earlier overviews, reveals methodological strengths, identifies effective approaches for different geothermal tasks, and uncovers underexplored areas such as environmental assessment and techno-economic analysis.}

Grounded in the Knowledge-Based View, we differentiate between AI application innovation and AI method innovation, analyzing their distinct environmental outcomes using data from Chinese-listed enterprises (2016–2021). Our findings reveal that AI application innovation follows a U-shaped relationship with environmental performance: early stages may lead to increased resource consumption and pollution, while positive effects emerge as adoption scales up. In contrast, AI method innovation consistently enhances environmental performance. The study further identifies the moderating role of enterprise size, showing that larger enterprises experience stronger positive effects from AI method innovation, while the U-shaped relationship of AI application innovation becomes flatter as enterprise size increases. These insights provide a nuanced understanding of AII's environmental implications, contributing to the literature by clarifying both linear and nonlinear effects. The findings offer practical guidance for enterprises to optimize AI strategies and advise policymakers on tailoring support measures to promote sustainable AI adoption across various organizational contexts.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into health care, including psychiatry and psychology. In educational contexts, AI offers new possibilities for enhancing clinical reasoning, personalizing content delivery, and supporting professional development. Despite this emerging interest, a comprehensive understanding of how AI is currently used in mental health education, and the challenges associated with its adoption, remains limited.
Objective
This scoping review aimed to identify and characterize current applications of AI in the teaching and learning of psychiatry and psychology. It also sought to document reported facilitators of and barriers to the integration of AI within educational contexts.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted across 6 electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, EBM Reviews, and Google Scholar) from inception to October 2024. The review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Studies were included if they focused on psychiatry or psychology, described the use of an AI tool, and discussed at least 1 facilitator of or barrier to its use in education. Data were extracted on study characteristics, population, AI application, educational outcomes, facilitators, and barriers. Study quality was appraised using several design-appropriate tools.
Results
From 6219 records, 10 (0.2%) studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight categories of AI applications were identified: clinical decision support, educational content creation, therapeutic tools and mental health monitoring, administrative and research assistance, natural language processing (NLP), program/policy development, students’ study aid, and professional development. Key facilitators included the availability of AI tools, positive learner attitudes, digital infrastructure, and time-saving features. Barriers included limited AI training, ethical concerns, lack of digital literacy, algorithmic opacity, and insufficient curricular integration. The overall methodological quality of included studies was moderate to high.
Conclusions
AI is being used across a range of educational functions in psychiatry and psychology, from clinical training to assessment and administrative support. Although the potential for enhancing learning outcomes is clear, its successful integration requires addressing ethical, technical, and pedagogical barriers. Future efforts should focus on AI literacy, faculty development, and institutional policies to guide responsible and effective use. This review underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure the safe, equitable, and meaningful adoption of AI in mental health education.}

This paper will view the rise of the e-patient, who is “equipped, enabled, empowered, and engaged” through the lens of the evolution of successive digital technology innovations, each building on its predecessors, creating new tools for patient empowerment. We begin with the dawn of the web and the proliferation of health websites and discuss the use of digital communication tools. We then discuss the adoption of electronic health records, which enabled the rise of patient portals. This digitization of health data, along with the rapid adoption of mobile internet access and the proliferation of health-related smartphone apps, in turn, provided a platform for patients to coproduce health care by contributing their own health data to their self-care and health care. The exchange of health information between patients and providers has also been facilitated by telehealth or telemedicine technology, which enables direct care delivery. The use of social networks in health, in use since the early days of the web, has expanded since COVID-19, when public health authorities worldwide, as well as patients, sought the use of social media channels to get connected and share information. Most recently, artificial intelligence and large language models have emerged with yet untapped potential to provide patients with the information that could improve their understanding of their conditions and treatment options. We conclude that innovations in digital health technology have symbiotically evolved with the ascendance of the e-patient, enabling improved communication, collaboration, and coordination between patients and clinicians and forging a health care system that is safer and more responsive to patient needs.}

The research adopts the full and sub sample methodologies to identify the interrelation of artificial intelligence index (AII) and renewable energy indicator (REI) in China. From the quantitative discussions, it is shown that there are favourable and negative impacts from AII to REI, and the positive ones indicate that artificial intelligence plays an incentive role in developing renewable energy. However, this incentive role cannot permanently be established if AII's effect on REI is negative, which is mainly caused by non-renewable energy with less costs. In turn, there is a favourable influence from REI to AII during COVID-19, highlighting that the downturn in renewable energy and stock markets caused by this epidemic impedes the progress of artificial intelligence in China. In the context of a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, the research would offer meaningful recommendations to facilitate the development of artificial intelligence, accelerate the application and promotion of artificial intelligence technology in the field of renewable energy, and build efficient models, processors and data centres through shifting to renewable energy.}

Generative AI offers a potential solution by augmenting image datasets, enabling more robust construction hazard detection. This paper investigates the use of generative AI for augmenting image data to improve hazard detection performance. Various combinations of generative AI tools and prompting strategies are tested. The results show that the combination of image-guided structured prompting with Stable Diffusion achieves the highest detection performance (mAP@50 of 92.5 %) using 150 augmented images.

keywords = {Artificial intelligence, embryo selection, in vitro fertilization, model robustness},
abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the stability and reliability of artificial intelligence (AI) models and approaches in embryo selection and rank ordering for in vitro fertilization (IVF).
Design
A laboratory-based study evaluating the stability and consistency of single instance learning models that assess embryos individually, predicting live-birth outcomes based solely on each embryo's morphological features. Fifty replicate convolutional neural networks with varying initialization parameters were trained and tested across two independent fertility center datasets. Model performance was assessed through embryo rank ordering, critical error rates, and intermodel variability. Interpretability analyses using gradient-weighted class activation mapping and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding were conducted to explore decision-making discrepancies among replicate models.
Subjects
The study utilized retrospective embryo datasets from Massachusetts General Hospital and Weill Cornell Fertility Center, including images from 1,258 patients and 10,713 embryos from Massachusetts General Hospital, and 53 patients with 648 embryos from Cornell.
Main Outcome Measures
Consistency in embryo ranking (Kendall’s W), frequency of critical errors (instances where low-quality embryos were top-ranked), and intermodel variability across datasets.
Results
The AI models demonstrated poor consistency in embryo rank ordering (Kendall’s W approximately 0.35) and exhibited high critical error rates (approximately 15%), often ranking lower-quality embryos above viable ones. Significant intermodel variability was observed even among models with similar predictive accuracies (area under curve approximately 60%). When tested on data from a different fertility center, model instability increased (error variance delta: 46.07%2), highlighting sensitivity to distribution shifts. Interpretability analyses revealed divergent decision-making strategies among replicate models, despite identical architectures and training protocols.
Conclusion
Single instance learning AI models for IVF embryo selection exhibit substantial instability and inconsistency, undermining their clinical reliability. High intermodel variability and critical error rates raise concerns about their suitability for real-world deployment.

Traditionally reliant on histological methods and clinical correlations, neuropathology is now experiencing a revolution due to the development of AI technologies like machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). These technologies enhance diagnostic accuracy, optimize workflows, and enable personalized treatment strategies. AI algorithms excel at analyzing histopathological images, often revealing subtle morphological changes missed by conventional methods. For example, deep learning models applied to digital pathology can effectively differentiate tumor grades and detect rare pathologies, leading to earlier and more precise diagnoses. Progress in neuroimaging is another helpful tool of AI, as enhanced analysis of MRI and CT scans supports early detection of neurodegenerative diseases. By identifying biomarkers and progression patterns, AI aids in timely therapeutic interventions, potentially slowing disease progression. In molecular pathology, AI’s ability to analyze complex genomic data helps uncover the genetic and molecular basis of neuropathological conditions, facilitating personalized treatment plans. AI-driven automation streamlines routine diagnostic tasks, allowing pathologists to focus on complex cases, especially in settings with limited resources. This review explores AI's integration into neuropathology, highlighting its current applications, benefits, challenges, and future directions.}

abstract = {The extraterritorial application of artificial intelligence (AI) laws and regulations is a form of global AI governance. The EU and China serve as two different examples of how to achieve the extraterritorial applicability of AI laws and regulations. The former shows an explicit territorial extension with more trigger factors, whereas the latter shows vertical regulation with a narrower territorial scope. Both countries’ legislative motivations differ but also have some commonalities. One of the primary goals of extraterritorial application of domestic laws is to protect citizens within their territory. The digital economy's characteristics make it necessary for AI laws to have extraterritorial effects. Without international conventions or treaties, there is a legal vacuum in AI regulation. Additionally, the extraterritorial application of AI laws and regulations helps a state become a global standard-setter and gain an international sphere of influence. However, the extraterritorial application of AI laws and regulations sometimes functions as a form of legal imperialism. This exacerbates the injustice between great powers and weak countries in AI competition. To justify the legitimacy of the extraterritorial application of AI laws and regulations, it is beneficial to adopt the ‘inner morality of extraterritoriality’, a theoretical framework proposed by Professor Dan Svantesson. In fact, extraterritorial applicability depends on the market size and attractiveness. For other countries, whether their AI laws and regulations are endowed with extraterritorial effects is their prerogative. However, they should consider their soft power before implementing legislation.}

We demonstrate that the decision to introduce AI is influenced by the retailer’s estimation of the consumers’ green preference (CGP) without AI as well as the unit adoption cost of AI. Specifically, irrespective of whether the retailer underestimates or overestimates the CGP without AI, as the estimation bias increases, the retailer becomes more inclined to adopt AI; however, an increase in the unit adoption cost will discourage adoption. Furthermore, we find that if the retailer underestimates the CGP without AI, adopting AI may negatively impact the profits of both the manufacturer and the supply chain, as well as the greenness level, while simultaneously enhancing social welfare. Conversely, if the CGP is overestimated, adopting AI can improve the manufacturer’s profit and the supply chain’s profit but decrease the greenness level and potentially harm social welfare. We extend the model by considering the prediction accuracy of AI, demonstrating that as the prediction accuracy increases, the retailer who underestimates the CGP without AI becomes more inclined to adopt AI; however, this may not hold under certain conditions if the CGP is overestimated.}

abstract = {Among various clinical skills, critical thinking (CT) is foundational for quality patient care. However, existing literature suggests deficiencies in applying analytical reasoning skills in healthcare education. As CT integration gains momentum in dentistry, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies introduces new dynamics. This article explores the potential impacts of emerging technologies of AI on the development and application of CT in the dental profession.
Methods
A narrative literature review of English-language publications was conducted using sources such as PubMed, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Wiley-Online-Library, and Oral-Health-Group. Our review focused on relevant articles published up to June 30,2024, representing a peak period of CT awareness. The search terms used included: “Critical thinking,” “healthcare,” “rubric,” “dental education,” and “Artificial intelligence.” No inclusion or exclusion criteria were applied. The search strategies aimed to synthesize collective healthcare experience in implementing CT in education, providing a cohesive understanding of the current state of CT and highlighting gaps in its integration in education.
Results
Strategies for incorporating CT into dental education are still developing. Although dental educators recognize the importance of CT-based curricula, barriers hinder effective implementation. Additionally, the rise of advanced technologies with human-like cognitive and non-cognitive capabilities necessitates agile, adaptable strategies to integrate CT in dental education. A simplified model is proposed for integrating AI into the development of CT skills at multiple levels in dental education. Furthermore, a rubric for assessing CT skills in problem-based learning is presented.
Conclusion
This review emphasizes the urgent need to strategically prioritize CT integration in dental education. Inadequate application of CT may increase the risk of AI misuse, and overreliance on AI could potentially undermine clinical decision-making. We propose that emerging technologies should be embraced as tools to enhance the development of CT skills while mitigating potential negative impacts. Plausible approaches to addressing this challenge are outlined.}

abstract = {Background
Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has demonstrated the feasibility of using HAP-water to respond to BMD changes without requiring dedicated software or calibration. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been utilized for diagnosising osteoporosis in routine CT scans but has rarely been used in DECT. This study investigated the diagnostic performance of an AI system for osteoporosis screening using DECT images with reference quantitative CT (QCT).
Methods
This prospective study included 120 patients who underwent DECT and QCT scans from August to December 2023. Two convolutional neural networks, 3D RetinaNet and U-Net, were employed for automated vertebral body segmentation. The accuracy of the bone mineral density (BMD) measurement was assessed with relative measurement error (RME%). Linear regression and Bland–Altman analyses were performed to compare the BMD values between the AI and manual systems with those of the QCT. The diagnostic performance of the AI and manual systems for osteoporosis and low BMD was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.
Results
The overall mean RME% for the AI and manual systems were − 15.93 ± 12.05 % and − 25.47 ± 14.83 %, respectively. BMD measurements using the AI system achieved greater agreement with the QCT results than those using the manual system (R2 = 0.973, 0.948, p < 0.001; mean errors, 23.27, 35.71 mg/cm3; 95 % LoA, −9.72 to 56.26, −11.45 to 82.87 mg/cm3). The areas under the curve for the AI and manual systems were 0.979 and 0.933 for detecting osteoporosis and 0.980 and 0.991 for low BMD.
Conclusion
This AI system could achieve relatively high accuracy for automated BMD measurement on DECT scans, providing great potential for the follow-up of BMD in osteoporosis screening.}

abstract = {Executive summary
Like all sectors, the movie industry has been both affected by and exploring potential uses of generative Artificial Intelligence ('AI'). On the one hand, movie studios have detected and begun to add warnings against unlicensed third-party uses of their content, including for AI training,11W Cho, ‘Universal Pictures to Big Tech: We’ll sue if you steal our movies for AI’ (6 August 2025) The Hollywood Reporter, available at https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/universal-pictures-big-tech-well-sue-if-you-steal-movies-ai-1236337712/. and have taken enforcement initiatives through court action. On the other hand, the use of AI within and by the industry itself has been growing. Regarding the latter, some have emphasised the opportunities presented by the implementation of AI, including by advancing claims that AI tools can offer a `purer' form of expression. Others have instead warned against the potential displacement of industry workers, including workers employed in technical roles and younger and emerging actors. Against the background illustrated above, this study maps and critically evaluates relevant issues facing the development, deployment, and use of AI models from a movie industry perspective. The legal analysis is conducted having regard to EU and UK copyright law and is divided into three parts:•Input/AI training: By considering relevant legal restrictions applicable to the training of AI models on protected audiovisual content, the border between lawful unlicensed uses and restricted uses is drawn;•Protectability of AI-generated outputs: Turning to the output generation phase, the protectability of such outputs is considered next, by focusing in particular on the requirements of authorship and originality under EU and UK copyright law;•Legal risks and potential liability stemming from the use of third-party AI models for output generation: Still having regard to the output generation phase, relevant legal issues that might arise having regard to the use of AI models that `regurgitate' third-party training data at output generation are considered, alongside the question of style protection under copyright. The main conclusions are as follows:•Input/AI training: Insofar as model training on third-party protected content is concerned, there are no exceptions under EU/UK law that fully cover the entirety of these processes. As a result, lacking legislative reform, the establishment of a licensing framework appears unavoidable for such activities to be deemed lawful;•Protectability of AI-generated outputs: The deployment of AI across various phases of the creative process does not render the resulting content unprotectable, provided that human involvement and control remain significant throughout, with the result that AI is relied upon as a tool that aids – rather than replaces – the creativity of industry workers.•Legal risks and potential liability stemming from the use of third-party AI models for output generation: The use of AI models that generate infringing outputs, such as by regurgitating input data or merely imitating style, may trigger the application of exclusive rights under copyright and related rights. The resulting liability may vest with the user of such models, as well as the model developer/provider. The latter aspect means that terms that exclude any such liability may ultimately be found to be unenforceable against users and ineffective against rightholders.}
