abstract = {Purpose
While previous studies have examined the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots to interpret optical coherence tomography scans, their performance in interpreting fundus photographs of retinal disorders without text-based context remains unexplored. This study aims to evaluate the ability of three widely used AI chatbots to accurately diagnose common retinal disorders from fundus photographs in the absence of text-based context.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Methods
We prompted ChatGPT-4, Gemini, and Copilot, with a set of 50 fundus photographs from the American Society of Retina Specialists Retina Image Bank® in March 2024, comprising age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, epiretinal membrane, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal detachment. Chatbots were re-prompted four times using the same images throughout June 2024. The primary endpoint was the proportion of each chatbot’s correct diagnoses. No text-based guidance was provided.
Results
In March 2024, Gemini provided a correct diagnosis for 17 (34 %, 95 % CI: 21–49 %) fundus images, ChatGPT-4 for 16 (32 %, 95 % CI: 20–47 %), and Copilot for 9 (18 %, 95 % CI: 9–31 %) (p > 0.05). In June 2024, Gemini provided a correct diagnosis for 122 (61 %, 95 % CI: 53–67 %) images, ChatGPT-4 for 101 (51 %, 95 % CI: 43–58 %), and Copilot for 57 (29 %, 95 % CI: 22–35 %).
Conclusion
No AI chatbot use in this study was sufficiently accurate for the diagnosis of common retinal disorders from fundus photographs. AI chatbots should not currently be utilized in any clinical setting involving fundus images, given concerns for accuracy and bioethical considerations.}

abstract = {State estimation (SE) is the most critical part of power systems management and control centers because correct data from the equipment in the network is needed before any operation. Power systems in the past were less complex than today's systems, so simple methods were sufficient to solve the SE problem. As power systems have developed and distribution systems have become more interconnected to enhance reliability and handle growing loads and uncertainties, the methods for solving the SE problem have evolved over time. Many methods have been employed so far to address the state estimate problem; each of these techniques has the potential to be helpful in particular situations; therefore, identifying the strategies and getting familiar with their features can be crucial. Based on this issue, SE methods are divided into two categories. In one category, their dynamic and static characteristics are specified, and another category is based on the application of methods. Most of the methods have been studied, and the advantages and disadvantages of each have been thoroughly investigated to identify their strengths and weaknesses. The methods based on artificial intelligence (AI) can have good potential in solving SE problems, so they have been specifically investigated. This category of SE methods can be beneficial in solving future problems. Based on this, the existing challenges for the future of SE have been discussed. As a case study, we demonstrate how AI techniques, such as transfer learning (TL), can address one of these challenges—specifically in handling network reconfiguration in a 118-bus system. This example can guide those interested in the field to tackle similar challenges and provide direction for future research.}

abstract = {Pharmacogenomics is entering a transformative phase as high-throughput “omics” techniques become increasingly integrated with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Although early successes in single-gene pharmacogenetics reported clear clinical benefits, many drug response phenotypes are governed by intricate networks of genomic variants, epigenetic modifications, and metabolic pathways. Multi-omics approaches address this complexity by capturing genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data layers, offering a comprehensive view of patient-specific biology. Advanced AI models, including deep neural networks, graph neural networks, and representation learning techniques, further enhance this landscape by detecting hidden patterns, filling gaps in incomplete data sets, and enabling in silico simulations of treatment responses. Such capabilities not only improve predictive accuracy but also deepen mechanistic insights, revealing how gene–gene and gene–environment interactions shape therapeutic outcomes. At the same time, real-world data from diverse patient populations is broadening the evidence base, underscoring the importance of inclusive datasets and population-specific algorithms to reduce health disparities. Despite challenges related to data harmonization, interpretability, and regulatory oversight, the synergy between multi-omics integration and AI-driven analytics holds relevant promise for revolutionizing clinical decision-making. In this review, we highlighted key technological advances, discussed current limitations, and outlined future directions for translating multi-omics plus AI innovations into routine personalized medicine.}

The study also evaluates the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting ENSO-induced impacts on crop productivity. Findings indicate that El Niño events often reduce rainfall, increasing drought stress, while La Niña leads to excessive precipitation and flooding—both of which adversely affect rice productivity. AI-based studies have shown that models such as Random Forest (RF), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) demonstrate strong potential, although limitations remain in terms of scalability and local adaptation. • Hybrid modeling approaches that integrate physical and statistical methods are essential. • Future research must enhance data quality and integrate adaptive technologies to support climate-resilient agriculture.}

Previous studies confirmed that using new emerging AI-based technologies will enable organisations to use digital transformation to achieve higher efficiency. A novel methodological AI-based approach for policymaking was constructed into three phases through the lens of organisational learning theory. The proposed framework was validated using a case study in the transportation industry of a small municipality. In the selected case study, a confirmatory model was developed and tested utilising the Structural Equation Modelling with data collected from a survey of 494 local stakeholders. Artificial Neural Network was utilised to predict and then to identify the most appropriate policy according to cost, feasibility, and impact criteria amongst six policies extracted from the literature. The results from this research confirm that utilisation of the AI-based strategic decision-making through the proposed generative AI platform at strategic level outperforms human decision-making in terms of applicability, efficiency, and accuracy.}

This review was conducted to understand how generative AI can play an important role in pharmacovigilance and improving drug safety monitoring. Data from previously published articles and news items were reviewed in order to obtain information. We used PubMed and Google Scholar as our search engines, and keywords (pharmacovigilance, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drug safety, and patient safety) were used. In toto, we reviewed 109 articles published till 31st January 2024, and the obtained information was interpreted, compiled, evaluated, and conclusions were reached. Generative AI has transformative potential in pharmacovigilance, showcasing benefits, such as enhanced adverse event detection, data-driven risk prediction, and optimized drug development. By making it easier to process and analyze big datasets, generative artificial intelligence has applications across a variety of disease states. Machine learning and automation in this field can streamline pharmacovigilance procedures and provide a more efficient way to assess safety-related data. Nevertheless, more investigation is required to determine how this optimization affects the caliber of safety analyses. In the near future, the increased utilization of artificial intelligence is anticipated, especially in predicting side effects and Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs).}

To train and test a Random Forest machine learning model with the ability to distinguish AI-generated from human-generated textual content in the domain of public health, and public health policy.
Study design
Supervised machine learning study.
Methods
A dataset comprising 1000 human-generated and 1000 AI-generated paragraphs was created. Textual features were extracted using TF-IDF vectorization which calculates term frequency (TF) and Inverse document frequency (IDF), and combines the two measures to produce a score for individual terms. The Random Forest model was trained and tested using the Scikit-Learn library and Jupyter Notebook service in the Google Colab cloud-based environment, with Google CPU hardware acceleration.
Results
The model achieved a classification accuracy of 81.8 % and an area under the ROC curve of 0.9. For human-generated content, precision, recall, and F1-score were 0.85, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively. For AI-generated content, these metrics were 0.79, 0.86, and 0.82. The MCC value of 0.64 indicated moderate to strong predictive power. The model demonstrated robust sensitivity (recall for AI-generated class) of 0.86 and specificity (recall for human-generated class) of 0.78.
Conclusions
The model exhibited acceptable performance, as measured by classification accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and other metrics. This approach can be further improved by incorporating additional supervised machine learning techniques and serves as a foundation for the future development of a sophisticated and innovative AI system. Such a system could play a crucial role in combating misinformation and enhancing public trust across various government platforms, media outlets, and social networks.}

abstract = {Background
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85 % of all lung cancer cases and remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and machine learning (ML) into NSCLC management has shown potential in improving diagnostic accuracy, treatment personalization, and patient outcomes. However, the impact of these technologies on patient-reported outcome measures (PROM), overall survival (OS), and cost-effectiveness remains underexplored. This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of AI, ANNs, and ML models on PROM, OS, and cost-effectiveness in adult patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC compared to conventional research methodologies and standard-of-care approaches.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines, with data synthesized using the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) approach. Data extraction focused on study design, patient characteristics, AI methodology, and outcomes of interest. Given the heterogeneity in study designs and statistical methods, a meta-analysis was deemed inappropriate.
Results
Ten studies were included after screening 509 articles. AI-based models demonstrated improvements in diagnostic precision, treatment optimization, and predictive accuracy for survival outcomes. AI-enhanced approaches outperformed conventional statistical models in prognosis prediction and resource allocation. However, data heterogeneity, model generalizability, and algorithmic transparency remain significant challenges.
Conclusion
Current evidence supports exploratory associations between AI models and prognostic stratification for OS; there is no evaluable evidence on PROM or cost‑effectiveness in NSCLC. Future prospective studies should incorporate validated PROM and formal economic evaluation alongside clinical endpoints. AI, ANNs, and ML have the potential to revolutionize NSCLC care by improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes. However, further research is needed to validate their real-world clinical applicability and address potential biases, ethical implications, and concerns regarding healthcare disparities.}

This paper explores an approach to AI governance in healthcare, specifically in hepatology. As AI continues to grow, it will be crucial for healthcare providers and our community as hepatologists to understand the implications and impact of this growth and what this means for our practice and patients. We draw from existing AI frameworks, principles of medical ethics, as well as quality healthcare principles to propose our framework for AI in hepatology. Our proposed framework includes patient-centered care, non-maleficence and safety, equity, transparency, accountability, and security and privacy. For each of these topics, we discuss examples relevant to hepatology. We also propose an action plan for hepatologists on how each of these principles can be upheld in our day-to-day practice. While many hepatology specific AI applications are currently being tested in research studies, they have not yet made it to “prime time.” As a result, the hepatology community has time to consider governance structures to put in place in preparation for the inherent challenges that come with AI implementation and integration into clinical care to ensure that care is responsible, ethical, safe, and secure. With careful and conscientious planning, the inclusion of relevant stakeholders, and laying the groundwork for governance, AI can improve quality of health care in hepatology with efficiency, improved safety, and equity.}

Scientific research has revealed only a minuscule fraction of the enzymes that evolution has generated to power life’s essential chemical reactions—and an even tinier fraction of the vast universe of possible enzymes. Beyond the enzymes already annotated lie an astronomical number of biocatalysts that could enable sustainable chemical production, degrade toxic pollutants, and advance disease diagnosis and treatment. For the past few decades, directed evolution has been a powerful strategy for reshaping enzymes to access new chemical transformations: by harnessing nature’s existing diversity as a starting point and taking inspiration from nature’s most powerful design process, evolution, to modify enzymes incrementally. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have started revolutionizing how we understand and compose the language of life. In this perspective, we discuss a vision for AI-driven enzyme discovery to unveil a world of enzymes that transcends biological evolution and perhaps offers a route to genetically encoding almost any chemistry.}

In this review, we assess AI methodologies derived from human microbiome studies that address foundational data challenges, including high dimensionality, compositionality, and sparsity.

We then shift our focus to the rhizosphere, exploring AI-driven approaches for predictive modeling of rhizosphere dynamics, integrating plant phenotypic and microbiome data, and designing synthetic microbial communities (SynComs). Finally, we discuss the major challenges and future prospects of using AI in rhizosphere microbiome research.

abstract = {Radiation therapy has dramatically changed with the advent of computed tomography and intensity modulation. This added complexity to the workflow but allowed for more precise and reproducible treatment. As a result, these advances required the accurate delineation of many more volumes, raising questions about how to delineate them, in a uniform manner across centers. Then, as computing power improved, reverse planning became possible and three-dimensional dose distributions could be generated. Artificial intelligence offers the opportunity to make such workflow more efficient while increasing practice homogeneity. Many artificial intelligence-based tools are being implemented in routine practice to increase efficiency, reduce workload and improve homogeneity of treatments. Data retrieved from this workflow could be combined with clinical data and omic data to develop predictive tools to support clinical decision-making process. Such predictive tools are at the stage of proof-of-concept and need to be explainatory, prospectively validated, and based on large and multicenter cohorts. Nevertheless, they could bridge the gap to personalized radiation oncology, by personalizing oncologic strategies, dose prescriptions to tumor volumes and dose constraints to organs at risk.}

abstract = {Interstellar missions will require a high degree of autonomy mediated through artificial intelligence (AI). All interstellar missions are characterised by 50-100-year transits to extrasolar systems. High system availability demands that interstellar spacecraft are self-repairable imposing significant demands on onboard intelligence. We review the current status of artificial intelligence to assess its capabilities in providing such autonomy. In particular, we focus on hybrid AI methods as these appear to offer the richest capabilities in offsetting weaknesses inherent in paradigmic approaches. Symbolic manipulation systems offer logical and comprehensible rationality with predictable behaviours but are brittle beyond their specific applications (a charge that may be levelled at neural networks unless the transfer learning problem can be resolved). More modern approaches to expert systems include Bayesian networks that incorporate probabilistic treatment to accommodate uncertainty. Artificial neural networks are fundamentally different. They are opaque to analysis but potentially offer greater adaptability in application by virtue of their ability to learn. Indeed, deep machine learning is a variation on neural networks with unsupervised neural front ends and supervised neural back ends. Reinforcement learning offers a promising approach for learning directly from the environment. There are inherent weaknesses in neural approaches regarding their hidden mechanisms rendering their distributed representations opaque to analysis. Hybridising symbolic processing techniques with artificial neural networks appears to offer the advantages of both. Human cognition appears to implement both neural learning and symbolic processing. There are several approaches to such hybridisation that we explore including knowledge-based artificial neural networks, fuzzy neural networks, Bayesian methods such as Markov logic networks and genetic methods such as learning classifier systems. Markov logic networks propose a natural correlation between Bayesian probability and neural weights but mapping representation of symbols into switching neurons is less clear (though vector symbolic architectures present an approach) while learning classifier systems are reinforcement learning methods that are promising for interacting with the physical world. We conclude that current AI may not yet be up to the task of interstellar transits and flybys let alone for physical interaction with unknown planetary environments. Certainly, AI is incapable of interactive encounters with extraterrestrial intelligence.}

These traditional modalities are especially ineffective in optimizing multiple pharmacologically relevant traits while maintaining robust environmental adaptability across diverse cultivation conditions concurrently. Advanced computational tools are emerging for biological research with parallel development of artificial intelligence (AI), which have also been explored for their applications in medicinal plant breeding. In the current comprehensive review, we carried out a systematic examination of the state-of-the-art AI applications across different aspects of the breeding pipeline, encompassing multi-omics data integration, synthetic biology, precision gene editing, trait optimization, and intelligent monitoring systems. Meanwhile, this review elucidated current obstacles of data integration, model generalization, and environmental adaptation when applying AI in medicinal plants, and proposed a concept of constructing a genotype–environment–management (G × E × M) interactive intelligent breeding platform. The integration of AI with biotechnology emphasizes data-driven precision, computational analysis, and potential for trait customization, contributing to shaping new approaches in medicinal plant breeding gradually.

abstract = {Most applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are designed for a confined and specific task. However, there are many scenarios that call for a more general AI, capable of solving a wide array of tasks without being specifically designed for them. The term General Purpose Artificial Intelligence Systems (GPAIS) has been defined to refer to these AI systems. To date, the possibility of an Artificial General Intelligence, powerful enough to perform any intellectual task as if it were human, or even improve it, has remained an aspiration, fiction, and considered a risk for our society. Whilst we might still be far from achieving that, GPAIS is a reality and sitting at the forefront of AI research. This work discusses existing definitions for GPAIS and proposes a new definition that allows for a gradual differentiation among types of GPAIS according to their properties and limitations. We distinguish between closed-world and open-world GPAIS, characterising their degree of autonomy and ability based on several factors such as adaptation to new tasks, competence in domains not intentionally trained for, ability to learn from few data, or proactive acknowledgement of their own limitations. We then propose a taxonomy of approaches to realise GPAIS, describing research trends such as the use of AI techniques to improve another AI (commonly referred to as AI-powered AI) or (single) foundation models. As a prime example, we delve into generative AI (GenAI), aligning them with the terms and concepts presented in the taxonomy. Similarly, we explore the challenges and prospects of multi-modality, which involves fusing various types of data sources to expand the capabilities of GPAIS. Through the proposed definition and taxonomy, our aim is to facilitate research collaboration across different areas that are tackling general purpose tasks, as they share many common aspects. Finally, with the goal of providing a holistic view of GPAIS, we discuss the current state of GPAIS, its prospects, implications for our society, and the need for regulation and governance of GPAIS to ensure their responsible and trustworthy development.}

abstract = {Background
Depression is a widespread mental health disorder that affects quality of life, with traditional treatments often resource-intensive. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of CBT-based AI in alleviating depressive symptoms through autonomous mental health management.
Purpose
To evaluate the effect and the integration level of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy-based artificial intelligence (AI) on autonomous health management in depressive symptoms care.
Methods
This systematic review used the PRISMA methodology and a mixed-methods appraisal tool. Studies included randomized controlled trials using artificial intelligence interventions for depression, analysing theoretical frameworks, intervention designs, and outcomes. Reviews and protocols were excluded. Data sources were searched in the Cochrane Library, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, and PubMed for articles published between October 2019 and October 2024.
Results
Five studies demonstrated that artificial intelligence designs incorporating the Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy guidance framework specifically indicated short-term intervention effectiveness. Of these AI interventions, only partial integration of 54 % implemented a theoretical framework in AI design. Nevertheless, findings revealed a significant 60 % decrease in depressive symptoms among participants who engaged with the AI-based autonomous mental health management, particularly those with moderate-to-severe depression, when grounded in a strong theoretical foundation.
Conclusion
Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy-based artificial intelligence interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in decrease depressive symptoms through patient self-management platforms. The theory-driven approach not only guides the development of AI applications but also facilitates the implementation of automated mental health interventions, thereby reducing the workload of nursing staff. This integration of CBT-guided AI technology empowers patients with self-management tools while optimizing nursing resources in mental health settings.}

This integration raises critical questions about the capabilities employees need to maintain a positive outlook on the rise of AI and the future of their career. We explore how goal reengagement capacities shape the impact of human-AI interaction. In two experimental studies, we develop a moderated mediation model in which goal reengagement capacities moderate the path from AI interaction (vs. a control group) through perceived threat of AI to career-related optimism. Using two experimental studies with students (N = 355) and full-time employees (N = 186), we show that individuals' goal reengagement capacities moderate the indirect relationship between AI interaction and career-related optimism via perceived threat of AI, such that this indirect effect is negative for those with low goal reengagement capacities and positive for those with high goal reengagement capacities. Our findings underscore the value of letting go of previously held goals and embracing new ones as AI reshapes the world of work, and highlight goal reengagement capacities as critical for maintaining career optimism in an AI-transformed workplace.}

An already overcrowded clinical residency curricula makes little room for a thorough AI education, the challenge of which may be overcome through longitudinal distinct educational tracks during residency or external courses offered through a variety of societies. In addition to teaching the fundamentals of AI, programs that offer education tools using AI will improve on antiquated clinical curricula. These education tools are a growing field in research and industry offering a variety of unique opportunities to promote active inquiry, improved comprehension, and overall clinical competence. The near 700 FDA-approved AI clinical tools almost guarantee that residents will be exposed to this technology, which may have mixed effects on education, although more research needs to be done to further elucidate this challenge. Ethical considerations, including algorithmic bias, liability, and postdeployment monitoring, highlight the need for structured instruction and mentorship.

The firm promotes a romantic-managerial conception of AI that suggests business specialists can help organizations reap the benefits of the miraculous promises of a human-centered AI, without incurring any of the drawbacks, based on the assumption that it is possible to control AI. Three complementary discursive archetypes are mobilized by the firm to spur organizations into action: the prophet, arousing enthusiasm by spreading the “Good News” about AI; the demystifier, numbing concerns about the potential drifts of the technical society; and the bird of ill omen, stoking a fear of inertia. This study highlights the relevance of Jacques Ellul’s work to stimulate the ongoing debate within the critical accounting community about the perils of AI’s proliferation in organizations and society. Beyond its traditional function of legitimizing expertise, content marketing is mobilized as a propaganda vehicle for a conception of AI seemingly shaped in the mold of the firm’s own professional services offering. Finally, by showing how the precepts of propaganda are incorporated into content marketing, this study highlights the commercialization of contemporary social issues as a pivotal step in the colonization of professional accounting services by marketing expertise.}

abstract = {The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in the construction industry has gained increasing momentum over the past decade. This study presents a systematic literature review aimed at evaluating the deployment of AI/ML technologies across the five key phases of the construction project life cycle: planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance, and demolition. The review follows PRISMA guidelines and employs a three-stage filtering process to analyze publications from 2013 to 2023. Findings indicate that the planning and construction phases feature the most extensive and mature applications, particularly in cost estimation, risk analysis, safety management, and scheduling optimization. In contrast, adoption in demolition and post-occupancy phases remains limited. The study also identifies major challenges including data quality, integration barriers, and ethical considerations. By mapping AI/ML use across lifecycle stages, this paper provides a structured foundation for further academic inquiry and practical implementation of intelligent technologies in construction.}

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
Hyperpolarized 129Xenon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures the extent of lung ventilation by ventilation defect percent (VDP), but VDP alone cannot distinguish between diseases. Prior studies have reported anecdotal evidence of disease-specific defect patterns such as wedge-shaped defects in asthma and polka-dot defects in lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Neural network artificial intelligence can evaluate image shapes and textures to classify images, but this has not been attempted in xenon MRI. We hypothesized that an artificial intelligence network trained on ventilation MRI could classify diseases based on spatial patterns in lung MR images alone.
Materials and Methods
Xenon MRI data in six pulmonary conditions (control, asthma, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, LAM) were used to train convolutional neural networks. Network performance was assessed with top-1 and top-2 accuracy, recall, precision, and one-versus-all area under the curve (AUC). Gradient class-activation-mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to visualize what parts of the images were important for classification.
Results
Training/testing data were collected from 262 participants. The top performing network (VGG-16) had top-1 accuracy=56%, top-2 accuracy=78%, recall=.30, precision=.70, and AUC=.85. The network performed better on larger classes (top-1 accuracy: control=62% [n=57], CF=67% [n=85], LAM=69% [n=61]) and outperformed human observers (human top-1 accuracy=40%, network top-1 accuracy=61% on a single training fold).
Conclusion
We developed an artificial intelligence tool that could classify disease from xenon ventilation images alone that outperformed human observers. This suggests that xenon images have additional, disease-specific information that could be useful for cases that are clinically challenging or for disease phenotyping.}

To address this research gap, this study employs the meta-analysis method, analyzing 39 experimental and quasi-experimental studies published in international journals between January 2010 and July 2024. The results reveal that: (1) AI has a moderately positive impact on students' 4C skills (the combined effect size = 0.624), while there is no significant difference in creativity, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration; (2) AI-based learning tools are most effective in enhancing the 4C skills of primary school students compared to other educational levels; (3) a mix of different technology types is more conducive to developing students' 4C skills than any single technology; (4) AI is most effective in fostering 4C skills when applied in adaptive systems and personalization; (5) smartphones, as AI learning devices, show significant potential in promoting 4C skills. These findings provide valuable insights for future research and practice aimed at leveraging AI tools to enhance students’ 4C skills, particularly by identifying key factors that maximize the effectiveness of AI in education.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) large language models are being used increasingly for health care–related queries. This systematic review assessed the reliability of AI chatbot responses to patient questions related to orthodontics.
Types of Studies Reviewed
PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, and Embase were systematically searched for studies published from January 1, 2022, through February 28, 2025. Only cross-sectional studies were included. Data were screened and extracted, and the risk of bias was assessed.
Results
Of 105 identified studies, 13 met the inclusion criteria. ChatGPT (OpenAI) showed 68.7% and 92.6% accuracy rates, scoring well on Likert scales and DISCERN evaluations. However, some studies reported lower scores (2.2/4.0, 3.8/10.0) and mixed results for Bard (Google) and Gemini (Google), highlighting inconsistencies in chatbot performance.
Practical Implications
Whereas large language models, particularly ChatGPT, cannot replace professional consultations, they offer generally reliable orthodontic information and can be valuable tools for addressing routine patient questions. Based on evolving commentary, AI is likely to serve as a frontline support system in the future, helping manage common inquiries, reduce clinician workload, and improve cost-effectiveness while ensuring that final care decisions remain with qualified professionals.

These paradigms demonstrate the multidimensional role of AI in design, ranging from automation to emotional interaction. The findings suggest that AI serves a dual role as both a design tool and a medium for innovation. AI not only enhances the automation and efficiency of the design process but also fosters designers' creative thinking and understanding of users' emotional needs. This study also proposes a path for the application of the four paradigms in the graphic design process, providing effective design ideas for future design workflows.}

The primary research question focuses on the feasibility of learning advantageous microstructural features from stochastic microstructure samples to facilitate the generative design of periodic microstructures, resulting in unprecedented properties. Instead of relying on brainstorming-based, ad hoc design inspiration approaches, we propose an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-based framework to automatically learn critical features from the exceptional outliers (with respect to properties) in stochastic microstructure samples, enabling the generation of novel periodic microstructure patterns with superior properties. This framework is demonstrated on three benchmark cases: designing 2D cellular metamaterials to maximize stiffness in all directions, to maximize the Poisson’s ratio in all directions, and to minimize the thermal expansion ratio. The effectiveness of the design framework is validated by comparing its novel microstructure designs with known stochastic and periodic microstructure designs in terms of the properties of interest.}

Nonetheless, the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) and institutional quality in the energy transition-carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions relationship is rare and complex in the literature. To fill this critical research gap, this study performs empirical analyses of the relationship between AI and CO2 emissions in 35 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries between 1990 and 2020, considering the critical role of institutions and energy transition in enhancing the environmental advantages of energy transition and promoting Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG-13). To pursue the study's objective, the newly introduced Augmented Anderson-Hsiao (AAH) estimator, an efficient technique for panel data analysis, was employed. The AHH estimator's results indicate that a 1% increase in the green quality index significantly reduces CO2 emissions by approximately 66.7%. Additionally, AI has a negative impact on the environment through its detrimental effects on carbon emissions. Finally, institutional quality has a positive and significant impact on reducing CO2 emissions, indicating a beneficial effect on improving environmental performance. These findings highlight the importance of investments in AI-enabled sustainable technologies, robust institutional frameworks, and strategic regulatory measures to expedite global decarbonization.}

However, regulatory, ethical, and technical challenges must be addressed to ensure its safe and effective implementation. Bias in AI can lead to disparities in healthcare delivery, while the “black-box problem” raises concerns about transparency and trust. Ethical principles must guide AI integration, particularly regarding patient safety, accountability, and liability. Privacy risks related to data collection and security are especially critical in ophthalmology, where large imaging datasets are essential. Additionally, AI-generated inaccuracies, or “hallucinations,” pose potential risks to clinical decision-making. Cybersecurity threats targeting AI-powered healthcare systems further emphasize the need for robust protections. Despite these challenges, AI has the potential to improve access to ophthalmic care, particularly in underserved regions, as seen in AI-assisted diabetic retinopathy screening. However, financial and infrastructural barriers remain significant obstacles to widespread adoption. Addressing these issues requires collaboration among stakeholders, including regulators, healthcare providers, AI developers, and policymakers, to establish clear guidelines and promote trustworthy AI systems. This review explores key regulatory and ethical concerns and highlights strategies to ensure the responsible integration of AI into ophthalmology.}

Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are leading to the proliferation of health applications. AI presents both opportunities and risks for migrants, including refugees, and asylum-seekers. This Personal View provides a critical perspective on opportunities and risks of using AI in migrant health. It synthesises literature insights to highlight the potential health benefits of AI, for both the general population and migrants, in areas including information retrieval, translation, education, empowerment, disease prevention and diagnosis, and personalised treatments. It addresses risks posed by AI, including the potential for tracking and monitoring individuals, which could threaten the anonymity and freedom of those using digital services, as well as the perpetuation or exacerbation of biases in the algorithms used. Current deficiencies in AI, including issues of quality and tendencies to sometimes invent data, as well as to reinforce existing biases and discriminatory processes, may also adversely impact on various groups of migrants coming from different parts of the world, compounding existing ethical challenges. Given the high level of digital infrastructure and opportunities for coherent policy-making and regulatory control within the region, Europe can provide leadership in developing guidelines, policies and agreements ensuring that AI serves migrants' health needs while not compromising their rights.}

Results
From 1296 studies, 18 (1.4%) met inclusion criteria. These studies primarily evaluated text-based materials, including online articles, and electronic health records, with most materials in English, but also incorporated other languages. Artificial intelligence played various roles, including evaluating complexity, text simplification/readability enhancement, translation, and question-answering. Only 5 studies involved participant engagement. Seven studies provided a health literacy definition, consistently describing it as an individual’s ability to obtain, understand, and use health information for informed decisions, often linking it to external factors. However, only 1 study incorporated an individual level health literacy measurement tool, whereas organizational level health literacy measurement remained largely overlooked. The AI techniques used included traditional machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models. Evaluation metrics were categorized into human evaluation, readability, and machine learning metrics.
Conclusion
The review highlights AI’s dynamic application in relation to health literacy; however, measurement of health literacy, at both an individual and organizational level, to evidence AI's effectiveness remains limited. In addition, future work should not only measure health literacy outcomes more rigorously but also pursue research on enhancing AI model performance, robust evaluation, and their practical implementation in real-world settings.}

abstract = {Purpose of review
WHO defines SCD as sudden unexpected death either within 1 h of symptom onset (witnessed) or within 24 h of having been observed alive and symptom-free (unwitnessed). Sudden cardiac arrest is a major cause of mortality worldwide, with survival to hospital discharge for hospital cardiac arrest and in-hospital cardiac arrest being only 9.3 % and 21.2 %, respectively, despite treatment highlighting the importance of effectively predicting and preventing cardiac arrest. This literature review aims to explore the role and application of AI (Artificial Intelligence) in predicting and preventing sudden cardiac arrest.
Material and methods
Eligible studies were searched from PubMed and Web of Science. The inclusion criteria were fulfilled if sudden cardiac death prediction and prevention, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning were included.
Conclusions
Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning have shown remarkable prospects in SCA risk stratification, which can improve the survival rate from SCA. Nonetheless, they have not been adequately trained and tested, necessitating further studies with explainable techniques, larger sample sizes, external validation, more diverse patient samples, multimodal tools, ethics, and bias mitigation to unlock their full potential.}

abstract = {Background
With the rapid development and iteration of generative artificial intelligence, the growing popularity of such groundbreaking tools among nurse researchers, represented by ChatGPT (OpenAI), is receiving passionate debate and intrigue. Although there has been qualitative research on generative artificial intelligence in other fields, little is known about the experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers; this study seeks to report on the topic.
Objective
This study aimed to describe the experiences and perceptions of generative artificial intelligence among Chinese nurse researchers, as well as provide a reference for the application of generative artificial intelligence in nursing research in the future.
Methods
Semistructured interviews were used to collect data in this qualitative study. Researchers mainly conducted interviews on the cognition, experience, and future expectations of nurse researchers regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence. Twenty-seven nurse researchers were included in the study. Through purposive sampling and snowball sampling, there were 7 nursing faculty researchers, 10 nursing graduate students, and 10 clinical nurse researchers. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis.
Results
Five themes and 12 subthemes were categorized from 27 original interview documents as follows: (1) diverse reflections on human-machine symbiosis, which includes the interplay between substitution and assistance, researchers shaping the potential of generative artificial intelligence, and acceptance of generative artificial intelligence with alacrity; (2) multiple factors of the usage experience, including individual characteristics and various usage scenarios; (3) research paradigm reshaping in the infancy stage, which involves full-process groundbreaking assistive tools and emergence of new research paths; (4) application risks of generative artificial intelligence, including intrinsic limitations of generative artificial intelligence and academic integrity and medical ethics; and (5) the co-improvement of technology and literacy, which concerns reinforcement needs for generative artificial intelligence literacy, development of nursing research generative artificial intelligence and urgent need for artificial intelligence–generated content detection tools. In this context, the first 4 themes form the rocket of the human-machine symbiosis journey. Only when humans fully leverage the advantages of machines (generative artificial intelligence) and overcome their shortcomings can this human-machine symbiosis journey reach the correct future direction (fifth theme).
Conclusions
This study explored the experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers interacting with generative artificial intelligence, which was a “symbiotic journey” full of twists and turns, and provides a reference and basis for achieving harmonious coexistence between nurse researchers and generative artificial intelligence in the future. Nurse researchers, policy makers, and application developers can use the conclusions of this study to further promote the application of generative artificial intelligence in nursing research, policy making, and product development.}

In this study, we utilise the wavelet-based quantile on quantile regression (QQR) to capture the evolving impact of the Artificial Intelligence Enabler Index (AII) on the Global ESG Index (ESGI). Based on raw data, AII's impact on ESGI varies across different quantiles, indicating artificial intelligence doesn't always boost ESG performance. We use wavelet analysis to explore AII's effects on ESGI over various time horizons. AII has more negative impacts in the short term due to early technology stages, slow social adaptation, and limited ESG awareness. However, in the medium to long term, AII's positives may outweigh its negatives, fueled by technological progress, efficiency gains, wider ESG adoption, and artificial intelligence applications in ESG. Hence, our analysis reveals that artificial intelligence's inhibitory effect on ESG performance is more pronounced in the short run. Still, its enhancement effect becomes significant over the medium to long term. In the face of a new technological revolution and industrial transformation, we will offer practical advice to boost ESG progress using artificial intelligence while simultaneously fostering energy transition.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to gain insights into the potential of using evidence from artificial intelligence (AI) in nursing support for clinical practice and decision-making and its implications for future studies.
Methods
This was a rapid review of the literature. The PubMed, CINAHL, and CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on nursing support using AI for patient care, published between 2010 and 2024. The included studies were assessed for quality appraisal using the mixed methods appraisal tool, version 2018, and data extracted from each study were synthesized narratively considering the review questions.
Results
After removing duplicates, 5,176 studies were identified, resulting in the inclusion of 20 studies. The 20 studies were published between 2012 and 2024, with five studies focusing on “providing information and advice to patients using AI,” seven studies on “clinical decision-making support for nurses using predictive algorithms,” and eight studies on “psychosocial support using AI-equipped social robots.” In the qualitative appraisal of these studies, the proportion of studies that met the quality criteria for each item ranged from 35% to 85%.
Conclusions and Implications
In this review, we identified 20 RCTs that have been published so far on AI in nursing support, and currently, research is shifting from the development and testing phase to the implementation and effectiveness verification phase. However, many studies were found to be at risk of bias, suggesting caution when applying the evidence to clinical practice. Moving forward, there is a pressing need for the accumulation of high-quality RCTs and evidence integration through meta-analyses.
Brief summary
This study explored the potential of AI in nursing support, highlighting 20 published RCTs. Research in this field is transitioning from development and testing to implementation and effectiveness verification.}

Utilizing a sample of Chinese digital enterprises listed overseas from 2000 to 2023, this study employs Python to extract keywords associated with “artificial intelligence” from corporate annual reports, thereby constructing a proxy measure for AI adoption. We empirically investigate the impact of AI adoption on innovation within digital enterprises. Our findings demonstrate that AI adoption significantly enhances innovation in digital enterprises, a result that remains robust across a series of robustness tests. Additional analysis reveals that the absorptive capacity of enterprises mediates the relationship between AI adoption and innovation, while slack resources act as a moderating factor, attenuating the link between absorptive capacity and innovation. This paper extends our understanding of the implications of AI on broader innovation entities, elucidating the mechanisms and boundary conditions of AI application in digital enterprises. It also offers insights into how enterprises can effectively integrate AI technology, strategically configure and utilize slack resources, and ultimately enhance their innovation performance.}

Qualitative data analysis from a co-curricular creative writing programme, including reflections, surveys, and focus-group interviews, reveals emerging artificial intelligence literacies and students’ improvisational aptitudes for interpreting, subverting, and transforming notions of authorship. Students decentred authorial attribution through the pragmatic adoption of the technology as a creative catalyst, negotiated creative conventions by adopting non-conventional communication strategies, and reconceptualised creativity as distributed across human and non-human agents. Our approach of student-driven learning for autonomous exploration, sense-making, and criticality with GenAI indicates the potential for promoting conditions for students to exercise intellectual equality and emancipation. The findings contribute to the understanding of authorship and creativity; begin to contour emerging GenAI literacies and competencies; and suggest that creative collaborations with GenAI may be a promising way to foster emancipatory practices in the classroom, while nurturing creative and critical skills.}

The complexity and heterogeneity of cancer makes early detection and effective treatment crucial to enhance patient survival and quality of life. The intrinsic creative ability of artificial intelligence (AI) offers improvements in patient screening, diagnosis, and individualized care. Advanced technologies, like computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, can analyze large datasets and identify patterns that permit early cancer detection, diagnosis, management and incorporation of conclusive treatment plans, ensuring improved quality of life for patients by personalizing care and minimizing unnecessary interventions. Genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics data can be combined with AI algorithms to unveil an extensive overview of cancer biology, assisting in its detailed understanding and will help in identifying new drug targets and developing effective therapies. This can also help to identify personalized molecular signatures which can facilitate tailored interventions addressing the unique aspects of each patient. AI-driven transcriptomics, proteomics, and genomes represents a revolutionary strategy to improve patient outcome by offering precise diagnosis and tailored therapy. The inclusion of AI in oncology may boost efficiency, reduce errors, and save costs, but it cannot take the role of medical professionals. While clinicians and doctors have the final say in all matters, it might serve as their faithful assistant}

However, the capacity and processing power of the human mind are limited, particularly in the current era where vast quantities of complex data require rapid processing. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into the management of VHD offers an opportunity to enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline clinical workflows, optimize procedural strategies, and predict outcomes and disease progression. Subsets of AI such as machine learning and deep learning algorithms can uncover the unseen data from routine investigations (eg, electrocardiograms, echocardiography, and computed tomography), providing robust and accurate risk prediction tools to inform personalized treatment strategies. Intraprocedurally, AI-based enhancements in imaging guidance can be leveraged to improve procedural safety and success. Digital twin technology can allow case-specific disease modelling, such as simulating valve designs and predicting adverse events, fostering precision medicine. By using the full potential of AI, clinicians can provide a comprehensive, personalized management strategy for VHD patients, ultimately enhancing clinical outcomes. However, models based on AI algorithms require rigorous validation across multiple centers to ensure their reliability. Concerns about bias, data privacy, and limited transparency challenge the application of AI decision-making to digital health care. This review discusses the applications of AI in the management of patients with VHD, highlights the future directions of AI technologies, and considers the challenges of integrating AI into clinical practice.}

Although the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has drawn increasing attention for its transformative potential in corporate governance, its implications for environmental disclosure have only begun to receive scholarly attention and warrant further investigation. This paper investigates the impact of artificial intelligence adoption on corporate greenwashing using a panel dataset of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2011 to 2022. Leveraging a novel AI adoption index derived from a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), we conduct empirical tests to assess the relationship between AI use and firms’ greenwashing strategies. Our findings reveal that AI adoption significantly reduces the incidence of greenwashing, which remains robust across multiple validation checks. Decomposition analysis across different technological categories shows that planning and decision systems constitute the most influential strand of AI in curbing greenwashing. Mechanism analysis indicates that this effect operates through enhanced operational efficiency, improved human capital structure, and increased green innovation. Additional heterogeneity analysis across subsamples reveals that the deterrent impact exhibits greater intensity in firms characterized by non-state-owned firms, polluting sectors, and technology-intensive enterprises. By highlighting the governance potential of AI in promoting credible environmental disclosure, this study provides new empirical evidence on the intersection of digital transformation and corporate sustainability.}

Peritoneal metastases (PM) significantly impact treatment options and prognosis of patients with cancer. Early detection and accurate evaluation are essential for guiding clinical decisions. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to provide a comprehensive overview and evaluate the performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and radiomics models for diagnosis and prognosis of PM on imaging.
Methods
A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was conducted for studies published up to July 2024 that evaluated AI or radiomics models analyzing imaging data for diagnosing or predicting prognosis in PM. Data were extracted, and if more than 3 studies evaluated the same endpoint and reported true/false positive and negative values, a meta-analysis was conducted to obtain pooled area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Bias was assessed using the PROBAST + AI tool.
Results
This review included 24 studies, of which 18 evaluated PM presence, 2 assessed PM severity (low versus high Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI)), and 4 focused on prognosis or treatment efficacy. Meta-analysis of 13 studies evaluating PM presence revealed a pooled AUC of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of 0.80. Subgroup analysis indicated comparable performance for 2D and 3D imaging data, and lower performance for models detecting occult PM compared to all PM presentations. Incorporating clinical factors into AI and radiomics models improved performance.
Conclusion
AI and radiomics models demonstrated promising performance outcomes for PM evaluation on imaging, showing potential to aid in diagnosis and prognosis prediction. However, large validation studies are needed to evaluate their effects in clinical practice.}

These findings were compared with responses from a sample of Australian and Chinese trainee teachers, comprising individuals nearing qualification with varied demographic and educational backgrounds. Eight vignettes depicting students with varying abilities and efforts were evaluated by the LLMs ten times each, resulting in 320 evaluations, with trainee teachers providing comparable ratings. For LD students, the LLMs exhibited lower frustration and higher sympathy than trainee teachers, while for non-LD students, LLMs similarly showed lower frustration, with ChatGPT3.5 aligning closely with Chinese teachers and ChatGPT4 demonstrating more sympathy than both teacher groups. Notably, LLMs expressed lower expectations of future academic failure for both LD and non-LD students compared to trainee teachers. Regarding feedback, the findings reflect ratings of the qualitative nature of feedback LLMs and teachers would provide, rather than actual feedback text. The LLMs, particularly ChatGPT3.5 and Gemini, were rated as providing more negative feedback than trainee teachers, while ChatGPT4 provided more positive ratings for both LD and non-LD students, aligning with Chinese teachers in some cases. These findings suggest that LLMs may promote a positive and inclusive outlook for LD students by exhibiting lower judgmental tendencies and higher optimism. However, their tendency to rate feedback more negatively than trainee teachers highlights the need to recalibrate AI tools to better align with cultural and emotional nuances.}

Creative problem-solving methods, in particular, present an intriguing means of researching AI’s capacity to identify problems within ambiguous situations, while also generating relevant, useful solutions that respond to authentic, real-world issues in a meaningful way. This paper examined the performance of three separate AI entries generated by GPT-4o as compared with 68 human team entries from students in grades 7–9 within the competitive World Solutions Challenge offered by the Future Problem Solving Program International (FPSPI). The three entries were blind-scored by trained human evaluators for measures of effectiveness, impact, humaneness, creative strength, and development of action plan. Though all three AI entries scored in the top 15 % for all measures, including achieving the top scores for effectiveness, impact, humaneness, development of action plan, and overall performance, the AI entries were not found to be significantly different than the student control group on the measure of creative strength. The results suggest that AI models like GPT-4 may approach human-like abilities on certain aspects of creative performance during a more comprehensive creative process than divergent thinking alone, providing new insight into the current creative strengths—and limitations—of existing AI models.}

This systematic review assesses AI's application, effectiveness and impact on nursing education, while identifying research limitations.
Background
AI integration in nursing education is transforming traditional teaching and learning paradigms.
Design
A systematic review.
Methods
Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library and CINAHL from the inception of the databases to November 1, 2024, focusing on "Artificial Intelligence" and "nursing education." Two reviewers independently screened and assessed the literature. The quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB-2) tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) tools evaluation for observational studies and the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for quasi-experimental studies.
Results
Fifteen studies involving 1464 nursing students and professionals were included. The application scenarios of AI technology in nursing education are diverse and varied and it has shown significant potential in many areas of nursing education, but conflicting results have also been observed. Evaluation of literature quality showed that there were seven high-quality studies and eight medium-quality studies. Artificial intelligence was found to have a positive impact on students at three levels: learning attitude and psychological effects, learning effectiveness and comprehensive clinical nursing competencies. Key research gaps were identified, including the lack of longitudinal studies, uneven study populations and the lack of measurement instrument validity and objectivity.
Conclusion
AI positively impacts nursing education but requires further research to address gaps and ensure long-term effectiveness and privacy protection.

However, the growing popularity and influence of models such as ChatGPT have raised concerns in education regarding academic integrity, as AI-generated content challenges the authenticity of student work and complicates traditional assessment practices. Existing plagiarism detection tools, such as Turnitin and GPTZero, attempt to identify AI-generated content; however, their reliability remains limited, as most struggle to accurately differentiate between human and AI essays. To address existing tools limitations, we propose a novel detection model leveraging three large language models (LLMs): Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2), Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa), and Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART). We first fine-tuned each model on two large-scale datasets to evaluate their effectiveness in distinguishing between human and AI-generated essays. To further enhance the performance, we applied both manual and automated hyperparameter optimization techniques, including Random Search, Grid Search, and Bayesian Optimization. Building on these experiments, we developed our BART-CNN model, which incorporates the best-performing BART configuration with an additional convolutional head classifier. Our BART-CNN model achieved impressive Macro F1-scores of 99.78 % and 98.10 % on the Kaggle and Hugging Face datasets, respectively, and demonstrated significant performance gains over baseline methods in cross-domain validation. Our study offers a critical advancement in AI plagiarism detection, helping to uphold academic standards and the assessment quality in an evolving AI landscape.}

Based on the perspective of corporate governance costs, we discuss the influence and function mechanism of artificial intelligence on corporate tax avoidance. The results show that artificial intelligence can promote tax avoidance for enterprises by increasing high-skilled labor cost and intelligent input cost. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that artificial intelligence exerts a more influence on corporate tax avoidance in circumstances where tax regulatory intensity is diminished, and the tax burden is escalated. This study enriches the research on the development of enterprise intelligence in the new era, opens the "black box" between artificial intelligence and tax avoidance, and provides evidence for the logic between them.}

Mechanism analysis reveals that AI enhances investment efficiency by improving information transparency and strengthening internal control. Further moderating effect tests show that the positive impact of AI on investment efficiency is more pronounced in firms with executives possessing technical expertise, operating in highly competitive product markets, or situated in high-tech industries. This research contributes to the literature by elucidating how AI empowers corporate investment decision-making and provides practical implications for enterprises aiming to leverage AI technologies to optimize their investment performance.}

abstract = {Objective
To assess the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) policies, educational resources, and perceptions within U.S. plastic surgery residency programs from the perspectives of program directors (PDs) and residents.
Design
Cross-sectional study using 2 anonymized surveys to evaluate AI-related policies, current use, educational tools, perceived barriers, and attitudes toward AI use in surgical education and residency applications.
Setting
Plastic surgery residency programs across the United States
Participants
Program directors (n = 77) were invited via email, with 24 (31%) responding. Residents (n = 89) were recruited via social media; 1 resident per program was randomly selected to ensure institutional diversity, with 23 (26%) completing the survey.
Results
Institutional adoption of AI was limited. Only 8% of PDs reported screening residency applications for AI-generated content, and 88% indicated their programs had no formal policies on AI use. AI-based educational tools were available in 13% of programs, 21% offered AI ethics training, and 8% reported using AI to assess surgical skill. Barriers included lack of expertise (65%), data privacy concerns (52%), cost (48%), and limited evidence of efficacy (48%). In contrast, residents reported substantial independent AI use (50%). Residents used platforms such as ChatGPT (50%), Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Claude (each 9%)—often to generate clinical explanations (43%), procedural guides (17%), and differential diagnoses (13%). One resident also reported undergoing AI-based surgical skill assessment. Despite this engagement, 74% stated their programs lacked AI-related educational resources. Residents expressed moderate trust in AI (mean 5.26/10), stating it “probably” or “definitely” has a place in their education (86%).
Conclusions
A marked discrepancy exists between institutional policies and resident usage of AI in plastic surgery education. As residents adopt these tools independently, there is an urgent need for evidence-based guidelines, validated resources, and structured implementation to ensure safe, effective integration into surgical training.}

In the luxury sector, its incorporation presents a particular complexity, as it requires a delicate balance between technological efficiency and the preservation of the symbolic, aesthetic, and emotional values that shape brand identity. This study aims to explore how professionals within the luxury sector perceive the integration of artificial intelligence and what conditions they consider necessary for the technology to be adopted without compromising exclusivity or the distinctive customer experience. The research followed a qualitative, exploratory methodology, based on semi-structured interviews with experts from various fields related to luxury management, technological innovation, and brand experience. Findings indicate that the acceptance of artificial intelligence in the luxury context depends on its ability to integrate invisibly, reinforce the narrative and emotional dimensions of the experience, and function as a relational infrastructure rather than an autonomous tool. Key strategies identified include its curatorial role in personalization processes and its cross-functional incorporation into collaborative organizational dynamics. From a practical standpoint, these results offer guidance for implementing advanced technologies in environments where cultural and symbolic sensitivity is essential to perceived value. The value of this study lies in proposing an alternative understanding of artificial intelligence as a symbolic mediator rather than a purely technical solution, thereby offering new insights for its application in identity-rich contexts.}

abstract = {Background
Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models, have shown promise in various fields, including health care. However, their performance on specialized medical board examinations, such as interventional cardiology assessments, remains relatively unexplored.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted using a data set comprising 360 questions from the Cath Self Assessment Program (CathSAP) question bank. This study aimed to assess the overall performance of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and compare it to that of average test takers. Additionally, the study evaluated the impact of pertinent educational materials on ChatGPT’s responses, both before and after exposure. The primary outcome measures included ChatGPT’s overall percentage score on the CathSAP examination and its performance across various subsections. Statistical significance was determined using the Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank test.
Results
Initially, ChatGPT achieved an overall score of 54.44% on the CathSAP exam, which improved significantly to 79.16% after exposure to relevant textual content. The improvement was statistically significant (P = .0003). Notably, the improved score was comparable with the average score achieved by typical test takers (as reported by CathSAP). ChatGPT demonstrated proficiency in sections covering basic science, pharmacology, and miscellaneous topics, although it struggled with anatomy, anatomic variants, and anatomic pathology questions.
Conclusions
The study demonstrates ChatGPT’s potential for learning and adapting to medical examination scenarios, with a notable enhancement in performance after exposure to educational materials. However, limitations such as the model’s inability to process certain visual materials and potential biases in AI models warrant further consideration. These findings underscore the need for continued research to optimize the use of AI in medical education and assessment.}

This study proposes a new framework for the AI entrepreneurship ecosystem that emphasizes the relationships, significance, and necessity of the factors shaping this field. Adopting a multifaceted approach that integrates several analyses—partial least squares structural equation modeling, importance-performance analysis, necessary conditions analysis, and artificial neural networks—this study identifies five predictors of AI entrepreneurship intention: entrepreneurial ecosystem, social influence, openness, performance expectancy, and market changes. Using 765 responses collected through a questionnaire from potential AI entrepreneurs, the findings show that the entrepreneurial ecosystem and social influence directly influence AI entrepreneurial intention, while the other factors act as mediators or moderators. The results indicate that managerial interventions should prioritize the entrepreneurial ecosystem and social influence, which are highly important but relatively underperforming. Moreover, although openness and performance expectancy are not primary drivers of AI entrepreneurial intention, they represent necessary conditions. This study makes an original contribution by examining the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the context of AI, as well as entrepreneurial intentions to adopt AI when starting a business.}
