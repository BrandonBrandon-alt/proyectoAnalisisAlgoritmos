abstract = {Objective
Artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise in surgery, but its role in plastic surgery education remains underexplored. This review evaluates the current landscape of AI in plastic surgery education.
Design
A systematic search was conducted on August 11, 2024, across PubMed, CINAHL, IEEE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using terms related to AI, plastic surgery, and education. Original research articles focusing on AI in plastic surgery education were included, excluding correspondence, reviews, book chapters, theses, corrections, and non–peer-reviewed or non-English articles. Two investigators independently screened studies and synthesized data. ROBINS-I was used to assess bias.
Results
Fifteen studies were included, with 13 evaluating large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing, and Google Bard. ChatGPT-4 outperformed other models on In-Service Examinations (average score of 72.7%) and demonstrated potential as a teaching assistant in plastic surgery education. AI-generated personal statements were comparable to human-written ones. However, ChatGPT showed inaccuracies in generating surgical protocols. ChatGPT demonstrated its ability to provide qualitative predictions, forecasting survey results that indicated limited current use of AI in plastic surgery education but support for further AI research. a study combined ChatGPT with DALL-E 2, a generative model, to create acceptable educational images. Machine learning was used in 1 study for evaluating surgical skill and providing real-time feedback during liposuction. Nine studies had low risk of bias, while 6 had moderate risk.
Conclusions
AI demonstrates potential as an educational tool in plastic surgery. However, limitations of evidence, such as AI model uncertainties, introduce ambiguity. While AI cannot replicate the expertise of seasoned surgeons, it shows promise for foundational learning and skill assessment. Developing authenticity guidelines and enhancing AI capabilities are essential for its effective, ethical integration into plastic surgery education.}

abstract = {Pharmacogenomics is entering a transformative phase as high-throughput “omics” techniques become increasingly integrated with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Although early successes in single-gene pharmacogenetics reported clear clinical benefits, many drug response phenotypes are governed by intricate networks of genomic variants, epigenetic modifications, and metabolic pathways. Multi-omics approaches address this complexity by capturing genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data layers, offering a comprehensive view of patient-specific biology. Advanced AI models, including deep neural networks, graph neural networks, and representation learning techniques, further enhance this landscape by detecting hidden patterns, filling gaps in incomplete data sets, and enabling in silico simulations of treatment responses. Such capabilities not only improve predictive accuracy but also deepen mechanistic insights, revealing how gene–gene and gene–environment interactions shape therapeutic outcomes. At the same time, real-world data from diverse patient populations is broadening the evidence base, underscoring the importance of inclusive datasets and population-specific algorithms to reduce health disparities. Despite challenges related to data harmonization, interpretability, and regulatory oversight, the synergy between multi-omics integration and AI-driven analytics holds relevant promise for revolutionizing clinical decision-making. In this review, we highlighted key technological advances, discussed current limitations, and outlined future directions for translating multi-omics plus AI innovations into routine personalized medicine.}

We examine several specific issues, beginning with GAI’s heavy consumption of natural resources and electricity. We then move to assessing how the rich and the Global North gain via GAI, while the poor and the Global South must deal with its adverse effects. We then move to assessing GAI’s impact on underrepresented communities and countries in the Global South; while GAI contributes to global warming, this affects people unevenly, because it is mostly rich people and the Global North that make intensive use of these technologies. After suggesting that more local and global laws are needed to regulate the sustainable use of AI, we report on how organizations can perform AI strategizing, for instance to control emissions in smart cities and improve weather forecasting. We conclude with a research agenda that aims to encourage IS scholars to focus on the environmental impact of AI, its ethical implications for organizations, and how GAI can be used strategically to benefit all.}

They mainly focus on the operational or functional levels, however, this study considers digital transformation at the strategic level. Previous studies confirmed that using new emerging AI-based technologies will enable organisations to use digital transformation to achieve higher efficiency. A novel methodological AI-based approach for policymaking was constructed into three phases through the lens of organisational learning theory. The proposed framework was validated using a case study in the transportation industry of a small municipality. In the selected case study, a confirmatory model was developed and tested utilising the Structural Equation Modelling with data collected from a survey of 494 local stakeholders. Artificial Neural Network was utilised to predict and then to identify the most appropriate policy according to cost, feasibility, and impact criteria amongst six policies extracted from the literature. The results from this research confirm that utilisation of the AI-based strategic decision-making through the proposed generative AI platform at strategic level outperforms human decision-making in terms of applicability, efficiency, and accuracy.}

CET-AIA integrates informal, context-sensitive questioning into assessment design to discourage AI-assisted cheating and enhance authentic student engagement. A quasi-experimental design was implemented across three undergraduate courses, comparing student and AI (ChatGPT-3.5) performance on traditional versus colloquial multiple-choice assessments. Theoretical foundations were drawn from Constructivism, Cognitive Load Theory, Sociocultural Theory, and Authentic Assessment. Performance trends were analyzed using t-tests, ANOVA, regression models, and mixed-effects modeling. Results indicate a significant initial decline in student scores under colloquial questioning, followed by gradual improvement, confirming both the cognitive challenge and adaptation process. In contrast, AI models showed a persistent performance drop when confronted with colloquial, context-specific questions. These outcomes demonstrate CET-AIA’s effectiveness in fostering deeper learning and in shielding assessments from AI exploitation. CET-AIA offers a scalable framework for designing AI-resistant assessments that promote critical thinking and real-world comprehension. The approach aligns with current educational priorities in fostering academic honesty and student-centered learning in digitally enhanced environments. This research is among the first to offer a theoretically grounded, empirically validated framework specifically designed to neutralize AI-assisted cheating through linguistic and contextual innovation. CET-AIA bridges the gap between AI ethics, pedagogy, and assessment, presenting a future-ready model for ethical education.}

This review was conducted to understand how generative AI can play an important role in pharmacovigilance and improving drug safety monitoring. Data from previously published articles and news items were reviewed in order to obtain information. We used PubMed and Google Scholar as our search engines, and keywords (pharmacovigilance, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drug safety, and patient safety) were used. In toto, we reviewed 109 articles published till 31st January 2024, and the obtained information was interpreted, compiled, evaluated, and conclusions were reached. Generative AI has transformative potential in pharmacovigilance, showcasing benefits, such as enhanced adverse event detection, data-driven risk prediction, and optimized drug development. By making it easier to process and analyze big datasets, generative artificial intelligence has applications across a variety of disease states. Machine learning and automation in this field can streamline pharmacovigilance procedures and provide a more efficient way to assess safety-related data. Nevertheless, more investigation is required to determine how this optimization affects the caliber of safety analyses. In the near future, the increased utilization of artificial intelligence is anticipated, especially in predicting side effects and Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs).}

abstract = {Objectives
To train and test a Random Forest machine learning model with the ability to distinguish AI-generated from human-generated textual content in the domain of public health, and public health policy.
Study design
Supervised machine learning study.
Methods
A dataset comprising 1000 human-generated and 1000 AI-generated paragraphs was created. Textual features were extracted using TF-IDF vectorization which calculates term frequency (TF) and Inverse document frequency (IDF), and combines the two measures to produce a score for individual terms. The Random Forest model was trained and tested using the Scikit-Learn library and Jupyter Notebook service in the Google Colab cloud-based environment, with Google CPU hardware acceleration.
Results
The model achieved a classification accuracy of 81.8 % and an area under the ROC curve of 0.9. For human-generated content, precision, recall, and F1-score were 0.85, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively. For AI-generated content, these metrics were 0.79, 0.86, and 0.82. The MCC value of 0.64 indicated moderate to strong predictive power. The model demonstrated robust sensitivity (recall for AI-generated class) of 0.86 and specificity (recall for human-generated class) of 0.78.
Conclusions
The model exhibited acceptable performance, as measured by classification accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and other metrics. This approach can be further improved by incorporating additional supervised machine learning techniques and serves as a foundation for the future development of a sophisticated and innovative AI system. Such a system could play a crucial role in combating misinformation and enhancing public trust across various government platforms, media outlets, and social networks.}

abstract = {Background
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85 % of all lung cancer cases and remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and machine learning (ML) into NSCLC management has shown potential in improving diagnostic accuracy, treatment personalization, and patient outcomes. However, the impact of these technologies on patient-reported outcome measures (PROM), overall survival (OS), and cost-effectiveness remains underexplored. This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of AI, ANNs, and ML models on PROM, OS, and cost-effectiveness in adult patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC compared to conventional research methodologies and standard-of-care approaches.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines, with data synthesized using the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) approach. Data extraction focused on study design, patient characteristics, AI methodology, and outcomes of interest. Given the heterogeneity in study designs and statistical methods, a meta-analysis was deemed inappropriate.
Results
Ten studies were included after screening 509 articles. AI-based models demonstrated improvements in diagnostic precision, treatment optimization, and predictive accuracy for survival outcomes. AI-enhanced approaches outperformed conventional statistical models in prognosis prediction and resource allocation. However, data heterogeneity, model generalizability, and algorithmic transparency remain significant challenges.
Conclusion
Current evidence supports exploratory associations between AI models and prognostic stratification for OS; there is no evaluable evidence on PROM or cost‑effectiveness in NSCLC. Future prospective studies should incorporate validated PROM and formal economic evaluation alongside clinical endpoints. AI, ANNs, and ML have the potential to revolutionize NSCLC care by improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes. However, further research is needed to validate their real-world clinical applicability and address potential biases, ethical implications, and concerns regarding healthcare disparities.}

As AI continues to grow, it will be crucial for healthcare providers and our community as hepatologists to understand the implications and impact of this growth and what this means for our practice and patients. We draw from existing AI frameworks, principles of medical ethics, as well as quality healthcare principles to propose our framework for AI in hepatology. Our proposed framework includes patient-centered care, non-maleficence and safety, equity, transparency, accountability, and security and privacy. For each of these topics, we discuss examples relevant to hepatology. We also propose an action plan for hepatologists on how each of these principles can be upheld in our day-to-day practice. While many hepatology specific AI applications are currently being tested in research studies, they have not yet made it to “prime time.” As a result, the hepatology community has time to consider governance structures to put in place in preparation for the inherent challenges that come with AI implementation and integration into clinical care to ensure that care is responsible, ethical, safe, and secure. With careful and conscientious planning, the inclusion of relevant stakeholders, and laying the groundwork for governance, AI can improve quality of health care in hepatology with efficiency, improved safety, and equity.}

Scientific research has revealed only a minuscule fraction of the enzymes that evolution has generated to power life’s essential chemical reactions—and an even tinier fraction of the vast universe of possible enzymes. Beyond the enzymes already annotated lie an astronomical number of biocatalysts that could enable sustainable chemical production, degrade toxic pollutants, and advance disease diagnosis and treatment. For the past few decades, directed evolution has been a powerful strategy for reshaping enzymes to access new chemical transformations: by harnessing nature’s existing diversity as a starting point and taking inspiration from nature’s most powerful design process, evolution, to modify enzymes incrementally. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have started revolutionizing how we understand and compose the language of life. In this perspective, we discuss a vision for AI-driven enzyme discovery to unveil a world of enzymes that transcends biological evolution and perhaps offers a route to genetically encoding almost any chemistry.}

In this review, we assess AI methodologies derived from human microbiome studies that address foundational data challenges, including high dimensionality, compositionality, and sparsity. Next, we examine the uses of these methods for the functional prediction of microbial traits. We then shift our focus to the rhizosphere, exploring AI-driven approaches for predictive modeling of rhizosphere dynamics, integrating plant phenotypic and microbiome data, and designing synthetic microbial communities (SynComs). Finally, we discuss the major challenges and future prospects of using AI in rhizosphere microbiome research. Specifically, we propose an emerging AI paradigm that integrates complementary inside-out (hologenome-based genomic selection) and outside-in (SynCom design) strategies, powered by transformative technologies such as federated learning, large language models, digital twins, and autonomous AI agents.

All interstellar missions are characterised by 50-100-year transits to extrasolar systems. High system availability demands that interstellar spacecraft are self-repairable imposing significant demands on onboard intelligence. We review the current status of artificial intelligence to assess its capabilities in providing such autonomy. In particular, we focus on hybrid AI methods as these appear to offer the richest capabilities in offsetting weaknesses inherent in paradigmic approaches. Symbolic manipulation systems offer logical and comprehensible rationality with predictable behaviours but are brittle beyond their specific applications (a charge that may be levelled at neural networks unless the transfer learning problem can be resolved). More modern approaches to expert systems include Bayesian networks that incorporate probabilistic treatment to accommodate uncertainty. Artificial neural networks are fundamentally different. They are opaque to analysis but potentially offer greater adaptability in application by virtue of their ability to learn. Indeed, deep machine learning is a variation on neural networks with unsupervised neural front ends and supervised neural back ends. Reinforcement learning offers a promising approach for learning directly from the environment. There are inherent weaknesses in neural approaches regarding their hidden mechanisms rendering their distributed representations opaque to analysis. Hybridising symbolic processing techniques with artificial neural networks appears to offer the advantages of both. Human cognition appears to implement both neural learning and symbolic processing. There are several approaches to such hybridisation that we explore including knowledge-based artificial neural networks, fuzzy neural networks, Bayesian methods such as Markov logic networks and genetic methods such as learning classifier systems. Markov logic networks propose a natural correlation between Bayesian probability and neural weights but mapping representation of symbols into switching neurons is less clear (though vector symbolic architectures present an approach) while learning classifier systems are reinforcement learning methods that are promising for interacting with the physical world. We conclude that current AI may not yet be up to the task of interstellar transits and flybys let alone for physical interaction with unknown planetary environments. Certainly, AI is incapable of interactive encounters with extraterrestrial intelligence.}

abstract = {The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important for micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and startups in Indonesia as it enhances their competitiveness, efficiency, and innovation. However, factors driving AI adoption may differ between these two business types. This study investigates these differential factors by extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model and adding the perceived intelligence construct. The explanatory quantitative research design employs purposive sampling, collecting data from 322 respondents (247 MSMEs and 75 start-ups). This extended model is analyzed using variance-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and multi-group analysis (MGA). The PLS-SEM results show that for MSMEs, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and perceived intelligence significantly influence behavioral intention, which, along with facilitating conditions, drives actual use. Conversely, for startups, performance expectancy and effort expectancy mainly drive behavioral intention, which in turn leads to actual use. Crucially, the MGA confirms significant differences between the two business types in terms of the effect of effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and perceived intelligence on behavioral intention, as well as the effect of facilitating conditions on actual use. The study’s results contribute to the literature by validating the need for specific technology adoption models. Moreover, the study offers practical implications by emphasizing the importance of tailoring AI adoption strategies to the unique characteristics and needs of MSMEs and startups.}

abstract = {Most applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are designed for a confined and specific task. However, there are many scenarios that call for a more general AI, capable of solving a wide array of tasks without being specifically designed for them. The term General Purpose Artificial Intelligence Systems (GPAIS) has been defined to refer to these AI systems. To date, the possibility of an Artificial General Intelligence, powerful enough to perform any intellectual task as if it were human, or even improve it, has remained an aspiration, fiction, and considered a risk for our society. Whilst we might still be far from achieving that, GPAIS is a reality and sitting at the forefront of AI research. This work discusses existing definitions for GPAIS and proposes a new definition that allows for a gradual differentiation among types of GPAIS according to their properties and limitations. We distinguish between closed-world and open-world GPAIS, characterising their degree of autonomy and ability based on several factors such as adaptation to new tasks, competence in domains not intentionally trained for, ability to learn from few data, or proactive acknowledgement of their own limitations. We then propose a taxonomy of approaches to realise GPAIS, describing research trends such as the use of AI techniques to improve another AI (commonly referred to as AI-powered AI) or (single) foundation models. As a prime example, we delve into generative AI (GenAI), aligning them with the terms and concepts presented in the taxonomy. Similarly, we explore the challenges and prospects of multi-modality, which involves fusing various types of data sources to expand the capabilities of GPAIS. Through the proposed definition and taxonomy, our aim is to facilitate research collaboration across different areas that are tackling general purpose tasks, as they share many common aspects. Finally, with the goal of providing a holistic view of GPAIS, we discuss the current state of GPAIS, its prospects, implications for our society, and the need for regulation and governance of GPAIS to ensure their responsible and trustworthy development.}

This integration raises critical questions about the capabilities employees need to maintain a positive outlook on the rise of AI and the future of their career. We explore how goal reengagement capacities shape the impact of human-AI interaction. In two experimental studies, we develop a moderated mediation model in which goal reengagement capacities moderate the path from AI interaction (vs. a control group) through perceived threat of AI to career-related optimism. Using two experimental studies with students (N = 355) and full-time employees (N = 186), we show that individuals' goal reengagement capacities moderate the indirect relationship between AI interaction and career-related optimism via perceived threat of AI, such that this indirect effect is negative for those with low goal reengagement capacities and positive for those with high goal reengagement capacities. Our findings underscore the value of letting go of previously held goals and embracing new ones as AI reshapes the world of work, and highlight goal reengagement capacities as critical for maintaining career optimism in an AI-transformed workplace.}

The investigation yields effective artificial intelligence algorithms that capture the essential and non-essential components of numerous parameters to be monitored in nuclear reactor control. The investigation further examines the interdependencies between various parameters and validates the statistical outputs of the model through attribution analysis. Furthermore, a Multivariant ANOVA analysis is conducted to identify the interactive plots and mean plots of crucial parameters interactions. The artificial intelligence algorithms demonstrate the correlation between the number of vacant staff jobs and both the frequency of license event reports each year and the ratio of contract employees to regular employees in the administrative domain. An AI method uncovers the relationships between the operator failing rate (OFR), operator processed errors (OEE), and operations at limited time frames (OLC). The AI algorithm reveals the interdependence between equipment in the out of service (EOS), progressive maintenance schedule (PRMR), and preventive maintenance schedules (PMRC). Effective machine learning neural network models are derived from generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithms and proposed for administrative, operational and maintenance loops of nuclear reactor control unit.}

An already overcrowded clinical residency curricula makes little room for a thorough AI education, the challenge of which may be overcome through longitudinal distinct educational tracks during residency or external courses offered through a variety of societies. In addition to teaching the fundamentals of AI, programs that offer education tools using AI will improve on antiquated clinical curricula. These education tools are a growing field in research and industry offering a variety of unique opportunities to promote active inquiry, improved comprehension, and overall clinical competence. The near 700 FDA-approved AI clinical tools almost guarantee that residents will be exposed to this technology, which may have mixed effects on education, although more research needs to be done to further elucidate this challenge. Ethical considerations, including algorithmic bias, liability, and postdeployment monitoring, highlight the need for structured instruction and mentorship.

The firm promotes a romantic-managerial conception of AI that suggests business specialists can help organizations reap the benefits of the miraculous promises of a human-centered AI, without incurring any of the drawbacks, based on the assumption that it is possible to control AI. Three complementary discursive archetypes are mobilized by the firm to spur organizations into action: the prophet, arousing enthusiasm by spreading the “Good News” about AI; the demystifier, numbing concerns about the potential drifts of the technical society; and the bird of ill omen, stoking a fear of inertia. This study highlights the relevance of Jacques Ellul’s work to stimulate the ongoing debate within the critical accounting community about the perils of AI’s proliferation in organizations and society. Beyond its traditional function of legitimizing expertise, content marketing is mobilized as a propaganda vehicle for a conception of AI seemingly shaped in the mold of the firm’s own professional services offering. Finally, by showing how the precepts of propaganda are incorporated into content marketing, this study highlights the commercialization of contemporary social issues as a pivotal step in the colonization of professional accounting services by marketing expertise.}

abstract = {Cervical cancer is a significant health issue affecting women globally, with a high number of new cases and deaths reported each year. The disease is linked to HPV infection, but early detection through Pap smear tests can significantly increase performance. Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks, transfer learning, generative adversarial networks, and attention mechanisms, are employed to identify cervical cancer. These innovative methods can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of cervical cancer screening and diagnosis. Although these technologies provide advantages for diagnosing cervical cancer, issues related to the availability and integrity of data, interpretability of models, and integration into clinical workflows exist. A computer-aided diagnostic system that uses vision transformers, a majority fusion mechanism, and explainable artificial intelligence is presented to address these challenges. This framework aims to increase cervical cancer detection accuracy and efficiency. Two cutting-edge datasets, DTU/Herlev and SIPaKMeD, are used to evaluate the system, yielding overall accuracy results of 99.22% and 99.8%, respectively. A comparison of the suggested framework with state-of-the-art methods revealed equivalent or even better results.}

To address this research gap, this study employs the meta-analysis method, analyzing 39 experimental and quasi-experimental studies published in international journals between January 2010 and July 2024. The results reveal that: (1) AI has a moderately positive impact on students' 4C skills (the combined effect size = 0.624), while there is no significant difference in creativity, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration; (2) AI-based learning tools are most effective in enhancing the 4C skills of primary school students compared to other educational levels; (3) a mix of different technology types is more conducive to developing students' 4C skills than any single technology; (4) AI is most effective in fostering 4C skills when applied in adaptive systems and personalization; (5) smartphones, as AI learning devices, show significant potential in promoting 4C skills.

Artificial intelligence (AI) large language models are being used increasingly for health care–related queries. This systematic review assessed the reliability of AI chatbot responses to patient questions related to orthodontics.
Types of Studies Reviewed
PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, and Embase were systematically searched for studies published from January 1, 2022, through February 28, 2025. Only cross-sectional studies were included. Data were screened and extracted, and the risk of bias was assessed.
Results
Of 105 identified studies, 13 met the inclusion criteria. ChatGPT (OpenAI) showed 68.7% and 92.6% accuracy rates, scoring well on Likert scales and DISCERN evaluations. However, some studies reported lower scores (2.2/4.0, 3.8/10.0) and mixed results for Bard (Google) and Gemini (Google), highlighting inconsistencies in chatbot performance.
Practical Implications
Whereas large language models, particularly ChatGPT, cannot replace professional consultations, they offer generally reliable orthodontic information and can be valuable tools for addressing routine patient questions. Based on evolving commentary, AI is likely to serve as a frontline support system in the future, helping manage common inquiries, reduce clinician workload, and improve cost-effectiveness while ensuring that final care decisions remain with qualified professionals.

These paradigms demonstrate the multidimensional role of AI in design, ranging from automation to emotional interaction. The findings suggest that AI serves a dual role as both a design tool and a medium for innovation. AI not only enhances the automation and efficiency of the design process but also fosters designers' creative thinking and understanding of users' emotional needs.

The primary research question focuses on the feasibility of learning advantageous microstructural features from stochastic microstructure samples to facilitate the generative design of periodic microstructures, resulting in unprecedented properties. Instead of relying on brainstorming-based, ad hoc design inspiration approaches, we propose an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-based framework to automatically learn critical features from the exceptional outliers (with respect to properties) in stochastic microstructure samples, enabling the generation of novel periodic microstructure patterns with superior properties. This framework is demonstrated on three benchmark cases: designing 2D cellular metamaterials to maximize stiffness in all directions, to maximize the Poisson’s ratio in all directions, and to minimize the thermal expansion ratio. The effectiveness of the design framework is validated by comparing its novel microstructure designs with known stochastic and periodic microstructure designs in terms of the properties of interest.}

We emphasize a shared incentive structure that rests on fully integrating practitioners in the collaboration, including industry, municipalities, and the public.

Nonetheless, the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) and institutional quality in the energy transition-carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions relationship is rare and complex in the literature. To fill this critical research gap, this study performs empirical analyses of the relationship between AI and CO2 emissions in 35 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries between 1990 and 2020, considering the critical role of institutions and energy transition in enhancing the environmental advantages of energy transition and promoting Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG-13). To pursue the study's objective, the newly introduced Augmented Anderson-Hsiao (AAH) estimator, an efficient technique for panel data analysis, was employed. The AHH estimator's results indicate that a 1% increase in the green quality index significantly reduces CO2 emissions by approximately 66.7%. Additionally, AI has a negative impact on the environment through its detrimental effects on carbon emissions. Finally, institutional quality has a positive and significant impact on reducing CO2 emissions, indicating a beneficial effect on improving environmental performance. These findings highlight the importance of investments in AI-enabled sustainable technologies, robust institutional frameworks, and strategic regulatory measures to expedite global decarbonization.}

However, regulatory, ethical, and technical challenges must be addressed to ensure its safe and effective implementation. Bias in AI can lead to disparities in healthcare delivery, while the “black-box problem” raises concerns about transparency and trust. Ethical principles must guide AI integration, particularly regarding patient safety, accountability, and liability. Privacy risks related to data collection and security are especially critical in ophthalmology, where large imaging datasets are essential. Additionally, AI-generated inaccuracies, or “hallucinations,” pose potential risks to clinical decision-making. Cybersecurity threats targeting AI-powered healthcare systems further emphasize the need for robust protections. Despite these challenges, AI has the potential to improve access to ophthalmic care, particularly in underserved regions, as seen in AI-assisted diabetic retinopathy screening. However, financial and infrastructural barriers remain significant obstacles to widespread adoption. Addressing these issues requires collaboration among stakeholders, including regulators, healthcare providers, AI developers, and policymakers, to establish clear guidelines and promote trustworthy AI systems. This review explores key regulatory and ethical concerns and highlights strategies to ensure the responsible integration of AI into ophthalmology.}

abstract = {Objective
We developed a novel slit-lamp photography (SLP) generative adversarial network (GAN) model using limited data to supplement and improve the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)–based microbial keratitis (MK) screening model.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Subjects
Slit-lamp photographs of 67 healthy and 36 MK eyes were prospectively and retrospectively collected at a tertiary care ophthalmology clinic at a large academic institution.
Methods
We trained the GAN model StyleGAN2-ADA on healthy and MK SLPs to generate synthetic images. To assess synthetic image quality, we performed a visual Turing test. Three cornea fellows tested their ability to identify 20 images each of (1) real healthy, (2) real diseased, (3) synthetic healthy, and (4) synthetic diseased. We also used Kernel Inception Distance (KID) to quantitatively measure realism and variation of synthetic images. Using the same dataset used to train the GAN model, we trained 2 DenseNet121 AI models to grade SLP images as healthy or MK with (1) only real images and (2) real supplemented with GAN-generated images.
Main Outcome Measures
Classification performance of MK screening models trained with only real images compared to a model trained with both limited real and supplemented synthetic GAN images.
Results
For the visual Turing test, the fellows on average rated synthetic images as good quality (83.3% ± 12.0% of images), and synthetic and real images were found to depict pertinent anatomy and pathology for accurate classification (96.3% ± 2.19% of images). These experts could distinguish between real and synthetic images (accuracy: 92.5% ± 9.01%). Analysis of KID score for synthetic images indicated realism and variation. The MK screening model trained on both limited real and supplemented synthetic data (area under the receiver–operator characteristic curve: 0.93, bootstrapping 95% CI: 0.77–1.0) outperformed the model trained with only real data (area under the receiver–operator characteristic curve: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.50–1.0), with an improvement of 0.17 (95% CI: 0–0.4; 2-tailed t test P = 0.076).
Conclusions
Artificial intelligence–based MK classification may be improved by supplementation of limited real training data with synthetic data generated by GANs.

While a growing body of policy responses encourages human-AI complementarity, current measures remain fragmented and insufficient to address the structural risks of workforce displacement. This study presents a comprehensive synthesis of the evolving relationship between AI and employment, highlighting key areas for further inquiry and policy development.}

abstract = {Background
With the rapid development and iteration of generative artificial intelligence, the growing popularity of such groundbreaking tools among nurse researchers, represented by ChatGPT (OpenAI), is receiving passionate debate and intrigue. Although there has been qualitative research on generative artificial intelligence in other fields, little is known about the experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers; this study seeks to report on the topic.
Objective
This study aimed to describe the experiences and perceptions of generative artificial intelligence among Chinese nurse researchers, as well as provide a reference for the application of generative artificial intelligence in nursing research in the future.
Methods
Semistructured interviews were used to collect data in this qualitative study. Researchers mainly conducted interviews on the cognition, experience, and future expectations of nurse researchers regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence. Twenty-seven nurse researchers were included in the study. Through purposive sampling and snowball sampling, there were 7 nursing faculty researchers, 10 nursing graduate students, and 10 clinical nurse researchers. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis.
Results
Five themes and 12 subthemes were categorized from 27 original interview documents as follows: (1) diverse reflections on human-machine symbiosis, which includes the interplay between substitution and assistance, researchers shaping the potential of generative artificial intelligence, and acceptance of generative artificial intelligence with alacrity; (2) multiple factors of the usage experience, including individual characteristics and various usage scenarios; (3) research paradigm reshaping in the infancy stage, which involves full-process groundbreaking assistive tools and emergence of new research paths; (4) application risks of generative artificial intelligence, including intrinsic limitations of generative artificial intelligence and academic integrity and medical ethics; and (5) the co-improvement of technology and literacy, which concerns reinforcement needs for generative artificial intelligence literacy, development of nursing research generative artificial intelligence and urgent need for artificial intelligence–generated content detection tools. In this context, the first 4 themes form the rocket of the human-machine symbiosis journey. Only when humans fully leverage the advantages of machines (generative artificial intelligence) and overcome their shortcomings can this human-machine symbiosis journey reach the correct future direction (fifth theme).
Conclusions
This study explored the experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers interacting with generative artificial intelligence, which was a “symbiotic journey” full of twists and turns, and provides a reference and basis for achieving harmonious coexistence between nurse researchers and generative artificial intelligence in the future. Nurse researchers, policy makers, and application developers can use the conclusions of this study to further promote the application of generative artificial intelligence in nursing research, policy making, and product development.}

In this study, we utilise the wavelet-based quantile on quantile regression (QQR) to capture the evolving impact of the Artificial Intelligence Enabler Index (AII) on the Global ESG Index (ESGI). Based on raw data, AII's impact on ESGI varies across different quantiles, indicating artificial intelligence doesn't always boost ESG performance. We use wavelet analysis to explore AII's effects on ESGI over various time horizons. AII has more negative impacts in the short term due to early technology stages, slow social adaptation, and limited ESG awareness. However, in the medium to long term, AII's positives may outweigh its negatives, fueled by technological progress, efficiency gains, wider ESG adoption, and artificial intelligence applications in ESG. Hence, our analysis reveals that artificial intelligence's inhibitory effect on ESG performance is more pronounced in the short run. Still, its enhancement effect becomes significant over the medium to long term. In the face of a new technological revolution and industrial transformation, we will offer practical advice to boost ESG progress using artificial intelligence while simultaneously fostering energy transition.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to gain insights into the potential of using evidence from artificial intelligence (AI) in nursing support for clinical practice and decision-making and its implications for future studies.
Methods
This was a rapid review of the literature. The PubMed, CINAHL, and CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on nursing support using AI for patient care, published between 2010 and 2024. The included studies were assessed for quality appraisal using the mixed methods appraisal tool, version 2018, and data extracted from each study were synthesized narratively considering the review questions.
Results
After removing duplicates, 5,176 studies were identified, resulting in the inclusion of 20 studies. The 20 studies were published between 2012 and 2024, with five studies focusing on “providing information and advice to patients using AI,” seven studies on “clinical decision-making support for nurses using predictive algorithms,” and eight studies on “psychosocial support using AI-equipped social robots.” In the qualitative appraisal of these studies, the proportion of studies that met the quality criteria for each item ranged from 35% to 85%.
Conclusions and Implications
In this review, we identified 20 RCTs that have been published so far on AI in nursing support, and currently, research is shifting from the development and testing phase to the implementation and effectiveness verification phase. However, many studies were found to be at risk of bias, suggesting caution when applying the evidence to clinical practice. Moving forward, there is a pressing need for the accumulation of high-quality RCTs and evidence integration through meta-analyses.
Brief summary
This study explored the potential of AI in nursing support, highlighting 20 published RCTs. Research in this field is transitioning from development and testing to implementation and effectiveness verification.}

abstract = {Background
Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is a common electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Although artificial intelligence (AI)–driven ECG analysis shows promise for LVSD screening, it remains unclear if a general AI-ECG model or one tailored for LBBB patients yields better performance.
Objectives
This study evaluates 4 AI-ECG models for detecting LVSD in LBBB patients and examines the impact of training cohort definitions.
Methods
We developed 4 models using 364,845 ECGs from 4 hospitals: 1) a general AI-ECG model; 2) a model trained on automatically extracted LBBB cases; 3) a model trained on a well-curated single-center LBBB data set with expert review; and 4) a hybrid model employing transfer learning by fine-tuning the general model with single-center LBBB data. LVSD was defined as an ejection fraction ≤40%. All models were externally validated on 1,334 ECGs from another hospital, with performance assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
Results
In external validation, the transfer learning model achieved the highest AUROC (0.903; 95% CI: 0.887-0.918), closely followed by the general model (0.899; 95% CI: 0.883-0.915); the difference was not significant. Models using automated or expert-based LBBB extraction had lower AUROCs (0.879 and 0.841, respectively). The general model demonstrated high sensitivity, whereas the transfer learning model exhibited superior specificity.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that a broad AI-ECG model reliably detects LVSD in LBBB patients, and transfer learning offers modest improvements without requiring curated LBBB data sets. Evaluating algorithms in representative clinical populations is essential.}

Qualitative data analysis from a co-curricular creative writing programme, including reflections, surveys, and focus-group interviews, reveals emerging artificial intelligence literacies and students’ improvisational aptitudes for interpreting, subverting, and transforming notions of authorship. Students decentred authorial attribution through the pragmatic adoption of the technology as a creative catalyst, negotiated creative conventions by adopting non-conventional communication strategies, and reconceptualised creativity as distributed across human and non-human agents. Our approach of student-driven learning for autonomous exploration, sense-making, and criticality with GenAI indicates the potential for promoting conditions for students to exercise intellectual equality and emancipation. The findings contribute to the understanding of authorship and creativity; begin to contour emerging GenAI literacies and competencies; and suggest that creative collaborations with GenAI may be a promising way to foster emancipatory practices in the classroom, while nurturing creative and critical skills.}

This thematic review distinguishes basic AI adoption from AI realization—the sustainable ability to embed, scale, and profit from AI through coherent data, skills, and routines. Three research strands are synthesised. First, the literature consistently identifies three driver groups—people, technical, and managerial—that accelerate or hinder realization. Second, progress is usually gauged with three measurement families: text mining of corporate filings, proxy indicators such as AI-related patents or robot density, and survey-based capability indices. Third, realised AI affects three performance domains: operational, financial, and environmental. Within O&G, value chain stage (upstream, midstream, downstream) and ownership model (state-owned and privately owned) modulate both measurement validity and outcome strength. These strands are integrated into a conceptual synthesis that links drivers to gauges and gauges to results, stressing triangulation across indicators to limit bias. Triangulated dashboards linking capability scores to these outcomes expose trade-offs, such as efficiency gains that raise energy use. Recommended actions for practitioners include: connecting operational, financial, and sustainability databases; deploying an annual “AI readiness” survey covering data, talent, and governance; and adopting shared reporting rules that enable cross-company learning. For scholars, the paper highlights measurement gaps, suggests triangulated research designs, and maps boundary conditions needing further study. Together, the insights give executives a firmer basis for allocating AI budgets and give researchers a clearer roadmap toward comparative, evidence-based evaluation of AI value in complex, asset-intensive settings.}

Digital twin technology can allow case-specific disease modelling, such as simulating valve designs and predicting adverse events, fostering precision medicine. By using the full potential of AI, clinicians can provide a comprehensive, personalized management strategy for VHD patients, ultimately enhancing clinical outcomes. However, models based on AI algorithms require rigorous validation across multiple centers to ensure their reliability. Concerns about bias, data privacy, and limited transparency challenge the application of AI decision-making to digital health care. This review discusses the applications of AI in the management of patients with VHD, highlights the future directions of AI technologies, and considers the challenges of integrating AI into clinical practice.}

abstract = {Amid growing scrutiny of corporate environmental disclosures, concerns have intensified regarding the prevalence of greenwashing. Although the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has drawn increasing attention for its transformative potential in corporate governance, its implications for environmental disclosure have only begun to receive scholarly attention and warrant further investigation. This paper investigates the impact of artificial intelligence adoption on corporate greenwashing using a panel dataset of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2011 to 2022. Leveraging a novel AI adoption index derived from a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), we conduct empirical tests to assess the relationship between AI use and firms’ greenwashing strategies. Our findings reveal that AI adoption significantly reduces the incidence of greenwashing, which remains robust across multiple validation checks. Decomposition analysis across different technological categories shows that planning and decision systems constitute the most influential strand of AI in curbing greenwashing. Mechanism analysis indicates that this effect operates through enhanced operational efficiency, improved human capital structure, and increased green innovation. Additional heterogeneity analysis across subsamples reveals that the deterrent impact exhibits greater intensity in firms characterized by non-state-owned firms, polluting sectors, and technology-intensive enterprises. By highlighting the governance potential of AI in promoting credible environmental disclosure, this study provides new empirical evidence on the intersection of digital transformation and corporate sustainability.}

Peritoneal metastases (PM) significantly impact treatment options and prognosis of patients with cancer. Early detection and accurate evaluation are essential for guiding clinical decisions. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to provide a comprehensive overview and evaluate the performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and radiomics models for diagnosis and prognosis of PM on imaging.
Methods
A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was conducted for studies published up to July 2024 that evaluated AI or radiomics models analyzing imaging data for diagnosing or predicting prognosis in PM. Data were extracted, and if more than 3 studies evaluated the same endpoint and reported true/false positive and negative values, a meta-analysis was conducted to obtain pooled area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Bias was assessed using the PROBAST + AI tool.
Results
This review included 24 studies, of which 18 evaluated PM presence, 2 assessed PM severity (low versus high Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI)), and 4 focused on prognosis or treatment efficacy. Meta-analysis of 13 studies evaluating PM presence revealed a pooled AUC of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of 0.80. Subgroup analysis indicated comparable performance for 2D and 3D imaging data, and lower performance for models detecting occult PM compared to all PM presentations. Incorporating clinical factors into AI and radiomics models improved performance.
Conclusion
AI and radiomics models demonstrated promising performance outcomes for PM evaluation on imaging, showing potential to aid in diagnosis and prognosis prediction. However, large validation studies are needed to evaluate their effects in clinical practice.}

Smart drug delivery systems can transfer drugs to specific tissues and cells, enhancing therapeutic effects while reducing undesirable side effects. Attention is focused on the main concepts and techniques of AI such as machine learning, deep learning, and genetic algorithms. In addition to this, genetic algorithms can be used for the selection of the best numerical models, which are able to predict biological processes or optimize the activity of new drugs. Besides the powerful impact of AI on drug design, its combination with new biotechnologies for personalized medicine, sometimes called theragnostics, brings novel diagnostic tools together with targeted therapy, which could ensure quality and effectiveness during clinical research on new drugs. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are finding their application in almost all disciplines, with particular success in healthcare. AI-based algorithms can solve complex problems related to diagnosis, prediction, control, and prevention of diseases that are beyond the scope of human abilities. At the same time, the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution has added value to the healthcare sector. The resulting combination of IoT and AI platforms presents a promising fusion to provide healthcare delivery innovations like digital drug delivery, online healthcare consultancy platforms, and virtual healthcare assistants. Personalized medicine is well-suited, regardless of potential disadvantages, to creating drug delivery systems that can respond to the exact needs and other special requirements of patients. The development of smart drug delivery systems is a potential response to the unimodal properties of drugs and the discordance between patient requirements and patient outcomes achieved by currently prescribed medications. The potential and actual positive economic and health-related impacts of advanced drug delivery technologies have created strong demand for new advanced delivery forms.}

These findings were compared with responses from a sample of Australian and Chinese trainee teachers, comprising individuals nearing qualification with varied demographic and educational backgrounds. Eight vignettes depicting students with varying abilities and efforts were evaluated by the LLMs ten times each, resulting in 320 evaluations, with trainee teachers providing comparable ratings. For LD students, the LLMs exhibited lower frustration and higher sympathy than trainee teachers, while for non-LD students, LLMs similarly showed lower frustration, with ChatGPT3.5 aligning closely with Chinese teachers and ChatGPT4 demonstrating more sympathy than both teacher groups. Notably, LLMs expressed lower expectations of future academic failure for both LD and non-LD students compared to trainee teachers. Regarding feedback, the findings reflect ratings of the qualitative nature of feedback LLMs and teachers would provide, rather than actual feedback text. The LLMs, particularly ChatGPT3.5 and Gemini, were rated as providing more negative feedback than trainee teachers, while ChatGPT4 provided more positive ratings for both LD and non-LD students, aligning with Chinese teachers in some cases. These findings suggest that LLMs may promote a positive and inclusive outlook for LD students by exhibiting lower judgmental tendencies and higher optimism. However, their tendency to rate feedback more negatively than trainee teachers highlights the need to recalibrate AI tools to better align with cultural and emotional nuances.}

Creative problem-solving methods, in particular, present an intriguing means of researching AI’s capacity to identify problems within ambiguous situations, while also generating relevant, useful solutions that respond to authentic, real-world issues in a meaningful way. This paper examined the performance of three separate AI entries generated by GPT-4o as compared with 68 human team entries from students in grades 7–9 within the competitive World Solutions Challenge offered by the Future Problem Solving Program International (FPSPI). The three entries were blind-scored by trained human evaluators for measures of effectiveness, impact, humaneness, creative strength, and development of action plan. Though all three AI entries scored in the top 15 % for all measures, including achieving the top scores for effectiveness, impact, humaneness, development of action plan, and overall performance, the AI entries were not found to be significantly different than the student control group on the measure of creative strength. The results suggest that AI models like GPT-4 may approach human-like abilities on certain aspects of creative performance during a more comprehensive creative process than divergent thinking alone, providing new insight into the current creative strengths—and limitations—of existing AI models.}

abstract = {Objective
To assess the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) policies, educational resources, and perceptions within U.S. plastic surgery residency programs from the perspectives of program directors (PDs) and residents.
Design
Cross-sectional study using 2 anonymized surveys to evaluate AI-related policies, current use, educational tools, perceived barriers, and attitudes toward AI use in surgical education and residency applications.
Setting
Plastic surgery residency programs across the United States
Participants
Program directors (n = 77) were invited via email, with 24 (31%) responding. Residents (n = 89) were recruited via social media; 1 resident per program was randomly selected to ensure institutional diversity, with 23 (26%) completing the survey.
Results
Institutional adoption of AI was limited. Only 8% of PDs reported screening residency applications for AI-generated content, and 88% indicated their programs had no formal policies on AI use. AI-based educational tools were available in 13% of programs, 21% offered AI ethics training, and 8% reported using AI to assess surgical skill. Barriers included lack of expertise (65%), data privacy concerns (52%), cost (48%), and limited evidence of efficacy (48%). In contrast, residents reported substantial independent AI use (50%). Residents used platforms such as ChatGPT (50%), Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Claude (each 9%)—often to generate clinical explanations (43%), procedural guides (17%), and differential diagnoses (13%). One resident also reported undergoing AI-based surgical skill assessment. Despite this engagement, 74% stated their programs lacked AI-related educational resources. Residents expressed moderate trust in AI (mean 5.26/10), stating it “probably” or “definitely” has a place in their education (86%).
Conclusions
A marked discrepancy exists between institutional policies and resident usage of AI in plastic surgery education. As residents adopt these tools independently, there is an urgent need for evidence-based guidelines, validated resources, and structured implementation to ensure safe, effective integration into surgical training.}

However, rather than ushering in an age of increasing automation and quantitative analysis, algorithmic advances in cytology (and pathology in general), stagnated for approximately a decade after its introduction. In the 2010’s, the advent of AlexNet, coupled with plummeting storage and GPU costs, open-source development environments and the marketing of affordable, high throughput digital slide scanners accelerated progress and interest in digital pathology AI/ML applications. While the widespread adoption of large-scale consortium level datasets (e.g., The Cancer Genome Atlas) spurred the development of AI/ML methods for surgical pathology, large-scale collection, and algorithmic modeling of cytology specimens has lagged behind due to the varied nature of cytology preparations and assessment. However, increasing attention has been paid to cytopathology with a commensurate increase in publications and commercial applications in this area. Still, the applications of AI/ML to cytopathology and the herculean effort to implement fully digital pathology services remain in its nascent stages.

In the luxury sector, its incorporation presents a particular complexity, as it requires a delicate balance between technological efficiency and the preservation of the symbolic, aesthetic, and emotional values that shape brand identity. This study aims to explore how professionals within the luxury sector perceive the integration of artificial intelligence and what conditions they consider necessary for the technology to be adopted without compromising exclusivity or the distinctive customer experience. The research followed a qualitative, exploratory methodology, based on semi-structured interviews with experts from various fields related to luxury management, technological innovation, and brand experience. Findings indicate that the acceptance of artificial intelligence in the luxury context depends on its ability to integrate invisibly, reinforce the narrative and emotional dimensions of the experience, and function as a relational infrastructure rather than an autonomous tool. Key strategies identified include its curatorial role in personalization processes and its cross-functional incorporation into collaborative organizational dynamics. From a practical standpoint, these results offer guidance for implementing advanced technologies in environments where cultural and symbolic sensitivity is essential to perceived value. The value of this study lies in proposing an alternative understanding of artificial intelligence as a symbolic mediator rather than a purely technical solution, thereby offering new insights for its application in identity-rich contexts.}

abstract = {Background
Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models, have shown promise in various fields, including health care. However, their performance on specialized medical board examinations, such as interventional cardiology assessments, remains relatively unexplored.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted using a data set comprising 360 questions from the Cath Self Assessment Program (CathSAP) question bank. This study aimed to assess the overall performance of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and compare it to that of average test takers. Additionally, the study evaluated the impact of pertinent educational materials on ChatGPT’s responses, both before and after exposure. The primary outcome measures included ChatGPT’s overall percentage score on the CathSAP examination and its performance across various subsections. Statistical significance was determined using the Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank test.
Results
Initially, ChatGPT achieved an overall score of 54.44% on the CathSAP exam, which improved significantly to 79.16% after exposure to relevant textual content. The improvement was statistically significant (P = .0003). Notably, the improved score was comparable with the average score achieved by typical test takers (as reported by CathSAP). ChatGPT demonstrated proficiency in sections covering basic science, pharmacology, and miscellaneous topics, although it struggled with anatomy, anatomic variants, and anatomic pathology questions.
Conclusions
The study demonstrates ChatGPT’s potential for learning and adapting to medical examination scenarios, with a notable enhancement in performance after exposure to educational materials. However, limitations such as the model’s inability to process certain visual materials and potential biases in AI models warrant further consideration. These findings underscore the need for continued research to optimize the use of AI in medical education and assessment.}

CNS cancers are complex, difficult-to-treat malignancies that remain insufficiently understood and mostly incurable, despite decades of research efforts. Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to reshape neuro-oncological practice and research, driving advances in medical image analysis, neuro–molecular–genetic characterisation, biomarker discovery, therapeutic target identification, tailored management strategies, and neurorehabilitation. This Review examines key opportunities and challenges associated with AI applications along the neuro-oncological care trajectory. We highlight emerging trends in foundation models, biophysical modelling, synthetic data, and drug development and discuss regulatory, operational, and ethical hurdles across data, translation, and implementation gaps. Near-term clinical translation depends on scaling validated AI solutions for well defined clinical tasks. In contrast, more experimental AI solutions offer broader potential but require technical refinement and resolution of data and regulatory challenges. Addressing both general and neuro-oncology-specific issues is essential to unlock the full potential of AI and ensure its responsible, effective, and needs-based integration into neuro-oncological practice.}

To summarize the relevance of remote symptom monitoring, person-centered statistical analyses, and artificial intelligence to precision health symptom science in oncology; and propose ways in which these three approaches can be integrated to further advance the field.
Methods
The following commentary was adapted from a talk delivered at the Symptom Science Experts Meeting in October 2023 at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. The commentary and talk were informed by an informal review of recent literature in precision health oncology symptom science.
Results
Several remote symptom monitoring interventions have demonstrated potential to reduce disease- and treatment-related symptom burden and improve health outcomes in patients with cancer. Data collected passively by wearable and sensor technologies are also being used to characterize patients’ health status. Person-centered statistical analyses have identified interindividual variability in the symptom experiences of patients with cancer. Together with artificial intelligence-based approaches, these analyses have identified factors associated with relatively adverse symptom experiences. Future directions for the field include integrating these approaches to optimize clinical resource allocation, tailor symptom management in real-time, and advance scientific knowledge of the symptom experience.
Conclusions
Integrating remote symptom monitoring, person-centered statistical analyses and artificial intelligence may provide deeper insights into how patients with cancer experience symptoms.
Implications for Nursing Practice
Findings from research that uses remote symptom monitoring, person-centered statistical analyses, and artificial intelligence may enhance clinicians’ ability to deliver personalized symptom management interventions.}

This study proposes a new framework for the AI entrepreneurship ecosystem that emphasizes the relationships, significance, and necessity of the factors shaping this field. Adopting a multifaceted approach that integrates several analyses—partial least squares structural equation modeling, importance-performance analysis, necessary conditions analysis, and artificial neural networks—this study identifies five predictors of AI entrepreneurship intention: entrepreneurial ecosystem, social influence, openness, performance expectancy, and market changes. Using 765 responses collected through a questionnaire from potential AI entrepreneurs, the findings show that the entrepreneurial ecosystem and social influence directly influence AI entrepreneurial intention, while the other factors act as mediators or moderators. The results indicate that managerial interventions should prioritize the entrepreneurial ecosystem and social influence, which are highly important but relatively underperforming. Moreover, although openness and performance expectancy are not primary drivers of AI entrepreneurial intention, they represent necessary conditions. This study makes an original contribution by examining the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the context of AI, as well as entrepreneurial intentions to adopt AI when starting a business.}

This article explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) as a valuable resource for fostering creative idea generation within co-creation strategies for university students. In a mixed-method analysis, we obtained valuable information regarding engagement through co-creation approaches. This paper describes the early implementation stages of the introductory course in technological entrepreneurship, applying the educational platform OpenEdR4C in a hybrid workshop with a group of 20 students in a public higher education institution in central Mexico, this being the first group of >900 people reached during 2024. The findings show that (a) the students are prone to use and explore AI tools in a natural and immediate manner, (b) interdisciplinary collaboration was effectively promoted through co-creation strategies, and (c) training the tool is crucial to keep engagement and ideas fluency. This is a contribution to the exploration to open new opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration, experiential learning, and knowledge co-production, ultimately empowering students to develop innovative solutions to complex societal challenges.}
