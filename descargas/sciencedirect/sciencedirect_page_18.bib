abstract = {An important application of artificial intelligence (AI) is to facilitate the implementation of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) across complex and multi-tiered value chains. Solving the challenges faced by (un)sustainable practices in global industries has become a priority for corporate actors, states, and civil society, legitimized by both ethical and legal arguments. In fisheries, mining, plastics, and forestry, despite its potential to improve ESG practices, AI technologies also risk furthering consumption practices, thus negatively affecting socio-economic and environmental sustainability. We highlight the potential for direct positive impacts of AI on each of the environmental, social, and governance mechanisms throughout the four industries. However, we also point to the risks that indirect impacts of AI-powered tools entail on ESG practices and the potential for industries to disconnect themselves from these indirect impacts. Finally, we suggest that the widespread use of AI to optimize consumption processes, without questioning overconsumption patterns, risks creating unsustainable practices at the global level.}

This study investigated the increasing utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in renewable energy systems (RES), their diverse applications, and an outlook for the future direction of research in the field. These applications include the wind turbine (WT)-driven doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) arrangements, particularly grid-tied DFIG; power converter design efficiency; and digital twin systems and economics. The use of AI in grid-tied DFIG and its power converter design and optimisation is being fueled by an increasing amount of pertinent RES operational data sets, high-performance computer resources, improved AI tools, and advancements in predicting control. These factors enable an increasing return on investment for system owners and operators. Modern AI technologies are driven by four principal methodologies: expert systems, fuzzy logic systems, metaheuristic systems, and machine and deep learning. The value maximization of WT-driven DFIG systems will soon depend on an AI architecture that will synergize the power converter electronic device, the edge (DFIG system/array controllers), and the cloud (for AI training and ML support). Including ML capabilities in the DFIG array controllers will help enable continuous advancements in power generation optimisation and open up more advanced grid-interactive features. These controllers will gather real-time data for AI inference engines (perhaps based on predictive neural logic) and the device-level inverters and transport the data to the cloud for more sophisticated ML tasks. This review briefly discusses how the growing interest in AI/ML is utilised in power converter design and its optimisation to overcome the grid-tied wind turbine-driven DFIG availability and efficiency issues.

abstract = {Background
Virtual staining is an artificial intelligence-based approach that transforms pathology images between stain types, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to immunohistochemistry (IHC), providing a tissue-preserving and efficient alternative to traditional IHC staining. However, existing methods for translating H&E to virtual IHC often fail to generate images of sufficient quality for accurately delineating cell nuclei and IHC+ regions. To address these limitations, we introduce VISTA, an artificial intelligence-based virtual staining platform designed to translate H&E into virtual IHC.
Methods
We applied VISTA to identify M2-subtype tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs) in H&E images from 968 patients with HPV+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma across six institutional cohorts. M2-TAMs are a critical component of the tumor microenvironment, and their increased presence has been linked to poor survival. Co-registered H&E and CD163 + IHC tissue microarrays were used to train (D1, N = 102) and test (D2, N = 50) the VISTA platform. M2-TAM density, defined as the ratio of M2-TAMs to total nuclei, was derived from VISTA-generated CD163 + IHC images and evaluated for prognostic significance in additional training (D3, N = 360) and testing (D4, N = 456) cohorts using biopsy or resection H&E whole slide images.
Results
High M2-TAM density was associated with worse overall survival in D4 (p = 0.0152, Hazard Ratio=1.63 [1.1–2.42]). VISTA outperformed existing methods, generating higher-quality virtual CD163 + IHC images in D2, with a Structural Similarity Index of 0.72, a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio of 21.5, and a Fréchet Inception Distance of 41.4. Additionally, VISTA demonstrated superior performance in segmenting M2-TAMs in D2 (Dice=0.74).
Conclusion
These findings establish VISTA as a computational platform for generating virtual IHC and facilitating the discovery of novel biomarkers from H&E images.}

abstract = {Purpose
A gripping keyword emerged in the dynamic world of 2022: GPT or the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), at its forefront, embodied by the mysterious ChatGPT. This technological marvel had been silently lurking in the background for just over five years. However, all of a sudden, it emerged onto the scene, capturing the public’s attention and quickly becoming one of the most widely adopted inventions in history. Therefore, this narrative review is conducted in order to explore the impact of generative AI and ChatGPT on lifelong learning and upskilling of students in higher education and address opportunities and challenges proposed by Artificial Intelligence from a global perspective.
Design/methodology/approach
This review has been conducted using a narrative literature review approach. For in-depth identification of research gaps, 105 relevant articles were included from scholarly databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, ERIC and Google Scholar. Seven major themes emerged from the literature to answer the targeted research questions that describe the use of AI, the impact of generative AI and ChatGPT on students, the challenges and opportunities of using AI in education and mitigating strategies to cope with the challenges associated with the integration of ChatGPT and generative AI in education.
Findings
The review of the literature presents that generative AI and ChatGPT have gained a lot of recognition among students and have revolutionized educational settings. The findings suggest that there are some contexts in which adult education research and teaching can benefit from the use of chatbots and generative AI technologies like ChatGPT. The literature does, however, also highlight the necessity of carefully considering the benefits and drawbacks of these technologies in order to prevent restricting or distorting the educational process or endangering academic integrity. In addition, the literature raises ethical questions about data security, privacy and cheating by students or researchers. To these, we add our own ethical concerns about intellectual property, such as the fact that, once we enter ideas or research results into a generative chatbot, we no longer have control over how it is used.
Practical implications
This review is helpful for educators and policymakers to design the curriculum and policies that encourage students to use generative AI ethically while taking academic integrity into account. Also, this review article identifies the major gaps that are associated with the impact of AI and ChatGPT on the lifelong learning skills of students.
Originality/value
This review of the literature is unique because it explains the challenges and opportunities of using generative AI and ChatGPT, also defining its impact on lifelong learning and upskilling of students.}

AI data-driven methodologies have transformative potential for decision-making and policymaking in urban governance. However, a gap exists between AI’s theoretical promises and its practical integration into governance frameworks. While smart cities highlight technological advancements, they also expose socio-political challenges such as inclusivity, ethics, and public trust. This study systematically reviews literature on AI adoption in urban planning and governance, examining decision-making advancements and the socio-political dimensions of AI integration. Unlike previous studies, our review connects technological innovation with governance contexts, offering a nuanced analysis of AI’s role in urban systems. The findings show that AI research in urban governance is concentrated in Europe, North America, and Asia, with Africa and Central America being underrepresented. Since 2020, AI research has surged due to smart city initiatives but remains mostly theoretical with limited practical applications in urban governance. Additionally, AI’s integration with public administration and urban studies is minimal, raising concerns about equity and transparency in algorithmic decision-making. By identifying these gaps and challenges, this study provides actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and researchers. Inclusive governance frameworks that balance technological innovation with ethical and sociopolitical considerations are recommended, to ensure that AI-driven urban development promotes equitable, efficient, and sustainable outcomes.}

We used data from a two-wave survey of Finnish respondents aged 18–80 years (n = 828) to analyze within- and between-person effects using hybrid multilevel regression modelling. We measured positive attitudes toward using AI in (a) the art and culture field in general, (b) music, (c) visual arts, (d) detecting forged art, and (e) creating art. The main independent variables were the basic psychological needs (perceived relatedness, autonomy, and competence) in using new technologies. The results showed that participants were less positive toward using AI in the art and culture field in general compared to many other fields, such as medicine and building and real estate technology. Stronger relatedness had within- and between-person effects on positive attitudes on using AI in the art and culture field in general, as well as in music, visual arts, and creating art. Stronger autonomy had within- and between-person effects on positive attitudes on using AI in detecting forged art and creating art. The results indicate that human needs for relatedness and autonomy are important in attitudes toward using AI in art. Hence, positive personal experiences with the use of new technology are likely to affect how people perceive the introduction of AI to the art field, which has been considered the last human frontier in the technological world.}

This study introduces a novel approach combining finite element simulations with machine learning (ML) to predict and analyze the elastic moduli of two-dimensional triangular lattice structures. Using the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm, an ML model was developed to predict moduli based on simulation data, aiming to establish a precise relationship between relative density and elastic moduli. A key objective is to provide an efficient estimation tool for researchers and engineers, verified through comparisons with existing closed-form solutions and experimental data. To enhance trust in predictions, Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations and Partial Dependence Plots, were employed to interpret the model's outputs and identify influential design variables. Findings revealed a non-linear relationship between relative density and elastic moduli, with ML models achieving high predictive accuracy.

abstract = {Accurate reliability predictions for state systems are essential for industries such as manufacturing, energy, and transportation and utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) considerably enhances this process. However, the several features that affect the target variable and their complicated relationships make this process challenging. This research overcomes these obstacles by applying feature engineering and selecting features using the Boruta method, which guarantees that the analysis is informed solely by the most relevant features. Applying three machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and artificial neural networks (ANN) to this refined dataset showed that the artificial neural networks outperformed the competing models with an accuracy of 0.84, largely due to its capacity to represent complicated, non-linear relationships. With an accuracy of 0.79, SVM proved its validity despite feature dependencies, whereas Naive Bayes attained 0.76. These results demonstrate that ANN has great promise as a tool for data-driven decision-making in important industries, with the ability to improve operational efficiency, reduce system failures, and strengthen maintenance plans.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a revolutionary tool yet to be fully integrated into several health care sectors, including medical imaging. AI can transform how medical imaging is conducted and interpreted, especially in cardio-oncology.
Objective
This study aims to systematically review the available literature on the use of AI in cardio-oncology imaging to predict cardiotoxicity and describe the possible improvement of different imaging modalities that can be achieved if AI is successfully deployed to routine practice.
Methods
We conducted a database search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Google Scholar from inception to 2023 using the AI research assistant tool (Elicit) to search for original studies reporting AI outcomes in adult patients diagnosed with any cancer and undergoing cardiotoxicity assessment. Outcomes included incidence of cardiotoxicity, left ventricular ejection fraction, risk factors associated with cardiotoxicity, heart failure, myocardial dysfunction, signs of cancer therapy–related cardiovascular toxicity, echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Descriptive information about each study was recorded, including imaging technique, AI model, outcomes, and limitations.
Results
The systematic search resulted in 7 studies conducted between 2018 and 2023, which are included in this review. Most of these studies were conducted in the United States (71%), included patients with breast cancer (86%), and used magnetic resonance imaging as the imaging modality (57%). The quality assessment of the studies had an average of 86% compliance in all of the tool’s sections. In conclusion, this systematic review demonstrates the potential of AI to enhance cardio-oncology imaging for predicting cardiotoxicity in patients with cancer.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that AI can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cardiotoxicity assessments. However, further research through larger, multicenter trials is needed to validate these applications and refine AI technologies for routine use, paving the way for improved patient outcomes in cancer survivors at risk of cardiotoxicity.

The high mortality rate is concerning, and tumour heterogeneity at the genetic, phenotypic, and pathological levels exacerbates the problem. In this context, lack of early diagnostic techniques and therapeutic resistance to drugs, sole awareness among the public, coupled with the unavailability of these modern technologies in developing and low-income countries, negatively impact cancer management. One of the prime necessities of the world today is the enhancement of early detection of cancers. Several independent studies have shown that screening individuals for cancer can improve patient survival but are bogged down by risk classification and major problems in patient selection. Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced the field of oncology, addressing various medical challenges, particularly in cancer management. Leveraging extensive medical datasets and innovative computational technologies, AI, especially through deep learning (DL), has found applications across multiple facets of oncology research. These applications range from early cancer detection, diagnosis, classification, and grading, molecular characterization of tumours, prediction of patient outcomes and treatment responses, personalized treatment, and novel anti-cancer drug discovery. Over the past decade, AI/ML has emerged as a valuable tool in cancer prognosis, risk assessment, and treatment selection for cancer patients. Several patents have been and are being filed and granted. Some of those inventions were explored and are being explored in clinical settings as well. In this review, we will discuss the current status, recent advancements, clinical trials, challenges, and opportunities associated with AI/ML applications in cancer detection and management. We are optimistic about the potential of AI/ML in improving outcomes for cancer and the need for further research and development in this field.}

Though in its early stage, existing intelligent signal controllers equipped with reinforcement learning (RL)-based feature extractor and large language model (LLM)-driven scenario understanding and decision support already demonstrate powerful data digesting ability. This study thus proposes a smart traffic light control system integrating a vision-based perception tool to extract traffic state from real-time snapshot image of the intersection, and an LLM agent controller for signal phase switching upon scenario analysis. An indicator describing the urgency for green time at phase level is defined to abstract the contextual information regarding the competition of multiple approaching traffic flows, which augments the LLM with domain-specific logical reasoning for signal control action generation, aimed at assigning green time to the flows with the most compelling needs. With a RL-based controller providing initial control decision as backup, the proposed method is able to handle both pre-trained and out-of-distribution scenarios through real-time traffic state diagnosis and knowledgeable reasoning. Simulation evaluation on different intersection layouts and vehicle compositions is conducted with horizontal comparison of five benchmarks. A decrease in average waiting time was realized by more than 5 % under normal traffic scenario and 20 % under emergency vehicle scenario, respectively. Further, comprehensive analysis was conducted to explore the applicability of the proposed method and feasibility for real-world application in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based intelligent traffic management.}

Defining optimal therapeutic sequencing strategies in prostate cancer (PC) is challenging and may be assisted by artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools for an analysis of the medical literature.
Objective
To demonstrate that INSIDE PC can help clinicians query the literature on therapeutic sequencing in PC and to develop previously unestablished practices for evaluating the outputs of AI-based support platforms.
Design, setting, and participants
INSIDE PC was developed by customizing PubMed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Publications were ranked and aggregated for relevance using data visualization and analytics. Publications returned by INSIDE PC and PubMed were given normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) scores by PC experts reflecting ranking and relevance.
Intervention
INSIDE PC for AI-based semantic literature analysis.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis
INSIDE PC was evaluated for relevance and accuracy for three test questions on the efficacy of therapeutic sequencing of systemic therapies in PC.
Results and limitations
In this initial evaluation, INSIDE PC outperformed PubMed for question 1 (novel hormonal therapy [NHT] followed by NHT) for the top five, ten, and 20 publications (nDCG score, +43, +33, and +30 percentage points [pps], respectively). For question 2 (NHT followed by poly [adenosine diphosphate ribose] polymerase inhibitors [PARPi]), INSIDE PC and PubMed performed similarly. For question 3 (NHT or PARPi followed by 177Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen-617), INSIDE PC outperformed PubMed for the top five, ten, and 20 publications (+16, +4, and +5 pps, respectively).
Conclusions
We applied INSIDE PC to develop standards for evaluating the performance of AI-based tools for literature extraction. INSIDE PC performed competitively with PubMed and can assist clinicians with therapeutic sequencing in PC.
Patient summary
The medical literature is often very difficult for doctors and patients to search. In this report, we describe INSIDE PC—an artificial intelligence (AI) system created to help search articles published in medical journals and determine the best order of treatments for advanced prostate cancer in a much better time frame. We found that INSIDE PC works as well as another search tool, PubMed, a widely used resource for searching and retrieving articles published in medical journals. Our work with INSIDE PC shows new ways in which AI can be used to search published articles in medical journals and how these systems might be evaluated to support shared decision-making.}

The analysis reveals that perceived usefulness plays a mediating role (β = 0.812, p < 0.01) between external factors and stakeholders’ intention to adopt AI solutions. Notably, personal factors (β = 0.686, p < 0.01) significantly influence the perception of AI’s usefulness, thereby shaping stronger adoption intentions.

At the same time, should an accident occur at nuclear power plants, such as a nuclear leak, the consequences can be more severe than those associated with traditional power generation facilities. Therefore, Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) has been an important technology in nuclear power plants. Traditional FDD methods mostly rely on the precise mathematical system model, which can be sometimes difficult to obtain in reality, and the detection accuracy of existing methods is thus limited. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, FDD methods based on AI have been widely used. In this work, we make a systematic review of AI-based FDD methods, in conjunction with the introduction of the traditional FDD methods, and present the corresponding application scenarios of them. We hope that this work will help researchers incorporate more advanced AI models in nuclear power plants FDD and enlighten those interested in this field.}

abstract = {The pharmaceutical manufacturing industry transforms through artificial intelligence (AI) by implementing process improvements along with productivity enhancements and product quality improvements. The combination of big data and AI applications through machine learning algorithms analyzes manufacturing inefficiencies and recommends improvements for both medicine formulation and packaging as well as quality control measures. The combination of temperature adjustment, pressure adjustment, and ingredient proportion control enables AI to enhance the production efficiency of tablets, capsules, and injections, and decrease both time requirements and cost expenses. AI also enhances blister pack and vial packing methods and automates quality control inspections to ensure consistency of products by detecting defects. Consistent, reliable, and effective production processes rely on real-time monitoring and AI-driven adjustments, which directly contribute to manufacturing pharmaceutical products of improved quality. The continuous observation of the production process by AI helps to detect safety-related risks, including equipment failures and contamination risks, while addressing them promptly to preserve production security. The utilization of AI helps businesses identify necessary equipment maintenance demands which enables companies to organize maintenance before equipment breakdowns occur. AI-driven data insights enable companies to make strategic choices based on real-time data, automate operational processes for efficiency, and respond to emerging industry patterns positively. Through enhanced operational efficiency, waste minimization, and improvement of profit margins, AI integration in pharmaceutical production can transform the sector.}

However, delegating decisions to AI is challenging, especially in contexts that go beyond classical optimization problems. Current research has so far largely neglected to include the viewpoints of the decision-affected and of surrogate decision-makers in the discussion. To address these gaps, in this study we rely on two experimental designs and complement our findings with qualitative interview data to shed light on both sides: the perspective of those affected by the decision and that of the decision maker in surrogate and ethically complex decision contexts. Findings reveal that the individual decision-making perspective may lead to opposing perceptions. Whereas the willingness to delegate an ethically challenging decision to AI in a surrogate decision context is lower than that in a non-surrogate context (decision-maker perspective), people affected by the decision do not generally prefer humans to AI (decision-affected perspective). By these findings, we contribute to the literature on AI-enabled decision-making and decision delegation to non-human entities.}

abstract = {Background
Facial biometric data, while valuable for clinical applications, poses substantial privacy and security risks.
Objective
This paper aims to address the privacy and security concerns related to facial biometric data and support auxiliary diagnoses, in pursuit of which we developed Digital FaceDefender, an artificial intelligence–driven privacy safeguard solution.
Methods
We constructed a diverse set of digitally synthesized Asian face avatars representing both sexes, spanning ages 5 to 85 years in 10-year increments, using 70,000 facial images and 13,061 Asian face images. Landmark data were separately extracted from both patient and avatar images. Affine transformations ensured spatial alignment, followed by color correction and Gaussian blur to enhance fusion quality. For auxiliary diagnosis, we established 95% CIs for pixel distances within the eye region on a cohort of 1163 individuals, serving as diagnostic benchmarks. Reidentification risk was assessed using the ArcFace model, applied to 2500 images reconstructed via Detailed Expression Capture and Animation (DECA). Finally, Cohen Kappa analyses (n=114) was applied to assess agreement between diagnostic benchmarks and ophthalmologists’ evaluations.
Results
Compared to the DM method, Digital FaceDefender significantly reduced facial similarity scores (FDface vs raw images: 0.31; FLAME_FDface vs raw images: 0.09) and achieved zero Rank-1 accuracy in Pose #2-#3 and Pose #2-#5, with near-zero accuracy in Pose #4 (0.02) and Pose #5 (0.04), confirming lower reidentification risk. Cohen Kappa analysis demonstrated moderate agreement between our benchmarks and ophthalmologists’ assessments for the left eye (κ=0.37) and right eye (κ=0.45; both P<.001), validating diagnostic reliability of the benchmarks. Furthermore, the user-friendly Digital FaceDefender platform has been established and is readily accessible for use.
Conclusions
In summary, Digital FaceDefender effectively balances privacy protection and diagnostic use.}

abstract = {Background
Patient-ventilator asynchronies (PVAs) are frequent complications in mechanically ventilated patients, contributing to adverse outcomes such as ventilator-induced lung injury, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and increased mortality. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing PVA detection, prediction, and optimization. Despite its growing potential, the full scope of AI applications in this field and persistent gaps in evidence remain inadequately explored.
Objective
This scoping review examines the breadth of AI-based approaches for managing PVAs, identifying key methodologies, evaluating research trends, and highlighting limitations in the current literature.
Methods
A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, and the Cochrane Library without time restrictions. Extracted data included study objectives, AI methodologies, patient populations, performance metrics, and clinical outcomes. The findings were synthesized into thematic categories to map advancements and research gaps.
Results
Twenty-six studies were identified that applied AI techniques to detect, predict, or optimize PVAs. The included studies employed a range of AI methodologies, including convolutional neural networks, long short-term memory networks, and hybrid algorithms. These models demonstrated high predictive performance, with accuracy ranging from 87 % to 99 % and AUROC values exceeding 0.98 for detecting complex asynchronous events. AI systems also showed promise in predicting weaning success and optimizing ventilatory settings through real-time patient-specific adjustments. However, challenges such as reliance on single-center datasets, inconsistencies in calibration, and limited implementation of explainable AI frameworks restrict their clinical applicability.
Conclusions
AI holds transformative potential in managing PVAs by enabling real-time detection, improved weaning prediction, and personalized ventilatory strategies. However, significant challenges remain, particularly the need for multi-center validation, standardized reporting protocols, and randomized controlled trials to evaluate clinical efficacy. Addressing these gaps is essential for integrating AI into routine critical care practice and transitioning from theoretical models to practical, real-world applications in intensive care units.}

Current research reveals robust defensive approaches; however, there remains a significant gap in the application of Generative AI to develop advanced attack scenarios capable of bypassing existing defense mechanisms. Our work attempts to fill this gap and spreads awareness regarding a potential exposure of Neural Network (NN)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) against AI-enhanced attacks. Unlike conventional approaches that focus on Input Perturbation, Data Poisoning, or Spoofing, we propose a novel offensive strategy called Attack Obfuscation.

The experimental investigation validates the proposed approach against three distinct datasets and different typologies of attacks, managing to successfully deceive the IDS.}

However, the modelling of the physical processes related to blood-integrated nanotechnology involves considerable intricacy and holds great significance. Considering these factors, we propose computational framework utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to simulate the hemodynamics of blood-mediated ternary nanofluid flow through parallel plates. Moreover, to investigate the impacts of thermal radiation and Lorentz force on fluid flow, we employed an artificial neural networks (ANNs)-integrated Bayesian regularization algorithm (BRA). The efficiency of the model is maintained by partitioning the dataset into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) subsets to mitigate over-fitting and guarantee optimum accuracy. We convert governing non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) via similarity transformation, and then applied the improved finite difference discretization known as the Keller-box method (KBM) to evaluate it. Augmenting the squeezing parameter leads to a deceleration of the velocity distribution, whereas an elevated Hartmann number enhances heat transmission. The regression assessments of 1 signify a strong alignment across the observed data and the predicted outcomes. AI was used in this study in two main ways: first, it was used to accurately predict how nanofluids would behave at high temperatures; and second, it was used to find the best way to design nanofluid-based thermal systems that have a lot of potential for use in medicine, especially when it comes to heart health.}

Traditional cancer therapies are limited by side effects and damage to healthy tissues, while modern targeted treatments face challenges such as drug resistance and restricted applicability across cancer types. Early diagnosis also remains difficult, as many methods lack the sensitivity and specificity needed to reliably detect small, early-stage tumors. This review explores hybrid nanomaterial-based delivery systems, such as lipid–gold nanoparticle composites combined with polymeric nanocarriers, to improve the precision and efficacy of gene therapy. Advances in nanotechnology are highlighted for their ability to augment gene-editing tools including RNA interference and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9), supported by techniques like optical tweezers, plasmonics, fluorescence imaging, and metamaterials. Nanophotonics in particular offers ultra-sensitive molecular imaging and real-time biomarker detection, underscoring its value for early cancer diagnosis. Artificial intelligence further strengthens these approaches by optimizing nanocarrier design, predicting therapeutic outcomes, and guiding personalized treatment strategies. Machine learning and deep learning platforms enable efficient analysis of complex genomic and clinical datasets, improving predictive accuracy and therapeutic customization. The review also outlines molecular mechanisms of gene therapy, from editing to expression, and addresses barriers to clinical translation, such as data integration, model validation, and regulatory considerations. Combining nanotechnology, artificial intelligence (AI), and gene-editing advances holds promise for more effective, targeted, and minimally invasive cancer treatments. These integrated strategies support earlier detection, enhance therapeutic precision, and provide a framework for translating experimental breakthroughs into clinical applications that better align with the goals of personalized medicine.}

The graded diagnosis of periodontitis has always been a difficulty for dentists. This systematic review aimed to investigate the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) models for periodontitis classification.
Data
This review includes original studies that explore the application of AI in periodontitis classification systems.
Sources
Two reviewers independently conducted a comprehensive search of literature published up to April 2024 in databases including PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library.
Study selection
A total of 28 articles were eventually included in this study, from which 10 mapping parameters were extracted and evaluated separately for each article.

We employ grid search tuning to compare these models and identify the one that fits our data. Additionally, we leverage Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide comprehensive insights into model behavior and decision-making processes. By applying XAI to the historical land susceptibility dataset, we identify key factors such as elevation, slope, aspect, slum areas prone areas, groundwater, topography wetness index (TWI), distance to road and rivers, land use, and soil types that have significance influence on land susceptibility predictions. Results show that topography elevation and distance to road influence land susceptibility more than other factors. This study demonstrates that integrating XAI methodology can enhance model performance and help in the effective communication of findings to policymakers and land managers. This approach not only improves the interpretability of susceptibility predictions but also fosters better-informed decision-making for anomaly detection, land use management, and disaster risk reduction, especially for areas near critical infrastructures.}

Review Methods
Eligible studies evaluated text-based generative AI models used in otolaryngology. Two reviewers screened and assessed studies using JBI and QUADAS-2 tools. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted on diagnostic accuracy outcomes, with subgroup analyses by task type and model version.
Results
Ninety-one studies were included; 61 reported quantitative outcomes. Of these, 43 provided diagnostic accuracy data across 59 model-task pairs. Pooled diagnostic accuracy was 72.7 % (95 % CI: 67.4–77.6 %; I² = 93.8 %). Accuracy was highest in education (83.0 %) and diagnostic imaging tasks (84.9 %), and lowest in clinical decision support (67.1 %). GPT-4 consistently outperformed GPT-3.5 across both education and CDS domains. Hallucinations and performance variability were noted in complex clinical reasoning tasks.
Conclusion
Generative AI performs well in structured otolaryngology tasks, particularly education and communication. However, its inconsistent performance in clinical reasoning tasks limits standalone use. Future research should focus on hallucination mitigation, standardized evaluation, and prospective validation to guide safe clinical integration.}

abstract = {During coal mining process, water inrush accidents primarily occur in the stage of roadway excavation and it accounts for approximately 70 %. At present, the most effective method is the mine transient electromagnetic advanced sounding for detecting water rich zones ahead of roadway excavation. Currently, the primary data processing technique for mine transient electromagnetic detected data is the fan shaped apparent resistivity method. However, it cannot meet the demands of coal mine geological transparency and precise mining. Besides, coal mine roadways are located in the three dimensional space and traditional transient electromagnetic 3D inversion involves massive computational quantity and it consumes a long computation time. Hence, it also cannot meet the requirement of rapid processing and real-time monitoring. Machine learning inversion algorithms can learn from large datasets and it can quickly identify target bodies. Based on coal mine hydrogeological characteristics, 1500 coal mine hydrogeological models were established to train sample data. Besides, finite volume method is employed to calculate mine transient electromagnetic responses to form sample database. During the 3D forward modeling of coal mine transient electromagnetic, three scenarios of coal mine hydrogeological geology are considered and they are disaster geological bodies located in the coal seam, floor and roof, respectively. Moreover, a 3D convolutional neural network was developed to conduct three-dimensional inversion calculations for transient electromagnetic data in coal mines. Furthermore, the comparison between the forward model and the inversion results have been done and it demonstrates the feasibility of machine learning for 3D inversion in transient electromagnetic applications within mines. Finally, machine learning inversion was conducted by field data from Huaibei coal mining and the inversion results were generally consistent with information of drilling geology. Hence, the field data inversion demonstrates its effectiveness. Additionally, the total inversion time was 485 milliseconds and it is less than one second. All in all, this high inversion speed lays the foundation for real-time processing and intelligent detection of transient electromagnetic signals in the coal mine.}

The systematic search comprised articles in the Scopus database, from 2000 to 2023. The results from 48 articles show that AI has been applied mainly to predict compressive strength and slump. Comparing the AI techniques to their R2, no clear trend was observed, i.e., there was no overall best algorithm; and their performance was not directly related to database size. Still, Random Forest obtained superior results in articles that compared multiple techniques. Some of the main gaps identified are the lack of studies with geopolymers synthesized in acidic environments or with waste-based or nanomaterials; and that AI has not been largely applied to properties besides compressive strength (e.g., fire resistance, durability, porosity, and thermal properties). Regarding transparency, authors have seldom publicized their codes, impairing proper review of the models. In conclusion, if properly and ethically adopted, AI is a promising tool for the development of geopolymer composites, which can optimize time and employee resources; and many applications remain unexplored.}

abstract = {Background
Trajectory modeling is a long-standing challenge in the application of computational methods to health care. In the age of big data, traditional statistical and machine learning methods do not achieve satisfactory results as they often fail to capture the complex underlying distributions of multimodal health data and long-term dependencies throughout medical histories. Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have provided powerful tools to represent complex distributions and patterns with minimal underlying assumptions, with major impact in fields such as finance and environmental sciences, prompting researchers to apply these methods for disease modeling in health care.
Objective
While AI methods have proven powerful, their application in clinical practice remains limited due to their highly complex nature. The proliferation of AI algorithms also poses a significant challenge for nondevelopers to track and incorporate these advances into clinical research and application. In this paper, we introduce basic concepts in generative AI and discuss current algorithms and how they can be applied to health care for practitioners with little background in computer science.
Methods
We surveyed peer-reviewed papers on generative AI models with specific applications to time-series health data. Our search included single- and multimodal generative AI models that operated over structured and unstructured data, physiological waveforms, medical imaging, and multi-omics data. We introduce current generative AI methods, review their applications, and discuss their limitations and future directions in each data modality.
Results
We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines and reviewed 155 articles on generative AI applications to time-series health care data across modalities. Furthermore, we offer a systematic framework for clinicians to easily identify suitable AI methods for their data and task at hand.
Conclusions
We reviewed and critiqued existing applications of generative AI to time-series health data with the aim of bridging the gap between computational methods and clinical application. We also identified the shortcomings of existing approaches and highlighted recent advances in generative AI that represent promising directions for health care modeling.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have transformed health care with applications in various specialized fields. Neurosurgery can benefit from artificial intelligence in surgical planning, predicting patient outcomes, and analyzing neuroimaging data. GPT-4, an updated language model with additional training parameters, has exhibited exceptional performance on standardized exams. This study examines GPT-4’s competence on neurosurgical board-style questions, comparing its performance with medical students and residents, to explore its potential in medical education and clinical decision-making.
Methods
GPT-4’s performance was examined on 643 Congress of Neurological Surgeons Self-Assessment Neurosurgery Exam (SANS) board-style questions from various neurosurgery subspecialties. Of these, 477 were text-based and 166 contained images. GPT-4 refused to answer 52 questions that contained no text. The remaining 591 questions were inputted into GPT-4, and its performance was evaluated based on first-time responses. Raw scores were analyzed across subspecialties and question types, and then compared to previous findings on Chat Generative pre-trained transformer performance against SANS users, medical students, and neurosurgery residents.
Results
GPT-4 attempted 91.9% of Congress of Neurological Surgeons SANS questions and achieved 76.6% accuracy. The model’s accuracy increased to 79.0% for text-only questions. GPT-4 outperformed Chat Generative pre-trained transformer (P < 0.001) and scored highest in pain/peripheral nerve (84%) and lowest in spine (73%) categories. It exceeded the performance of medical students (26.3%), neurosurgery residents (61.5%), and the national average of SANS users (69.3%) across all categories.
Conclusions
GPT-4 significantly outperformed medical students, neurosurgery residents, and the national average of SANS users. The mode’s accuracy suggests potential applications in educational settings and clinical decision-making, enhancing provider efficiency, and improving patient care.}

The South American tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick), represents a significant global threat to tomato crops. Rising infestations have led to the extensive use of insecticides, raising concerns about pesticide resistance, human health risks, and environmental contamination. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) provides real-time, scalable, and cost-effective alternatives to traditional pest detection methods, which are labour-intensive and prone to human error. As a result, this study comprehensively assesses the potential of AI in the early detection and mitigation of Tuta absoluta-induced tomato leaf diseases. A systematic literature review was conducted across four major academic databases: ScienceDirect, Scopus, ACM, and IEEE. After a rigorous screening process, 115 studies were selected from an initial pool of 178 papers based on the relevance of their methodologies. This paper synthesises current research on AI methodologies, pest detection technologies, and their agricultural applications for the early detection, identification, and management of Tuta absoluta-induced tomato leaf diseases. Beyond tomato crops, the findings offer broader implications for managing similar pests affecting other economically significant crops. The study concludes with actionable recommendations for integrating AI-driven pest detection into precision agriculture, with the goal of enhancing food security and promoting sustainable farming practices worldwide.}

Constructing representative DCs has been widely studied with well-known methods. However, challenges remain regarding the reproducibility of results and the need for a large set of sampled trips, which can be costly and time-consuming. This work presents a novel approach to constructing DCs using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). A multi-objective training approach incorporates model-based losses represented by discriminators to capture time-series trends of speed, acceleration, and jerk, and function-based losses to ensure that the generator respects physical constraints. These losses are activated sequentially according to a convergence measure that utilizes the Characteristic Parameters (CPs) of the generated DCs for the latest activated loss. A new loss is activated if the convergence measure is lower than a threshold. An early stopping mechanism can be triggered when the threshold condition is met at the last loss. The DC generator was validated comparing the artificial trips with real trips from four cities. This comparison involved computing the Relative Difference (RD) between the CPs. The results indicate that the approach can achieve less than a 10% RD, thus providing superior results than a classical approach, a vanilla GAN, and other variations. Additionally, the threshold-based loss activation led to a reduction in training time. Transfer Learning (TL) was employed to construct DCs for other regions. This approach reduces the need for extensive data collection and ensures the reproducibility of artificial DCs.}

The major frameworks are focused on identifying content and technical knowledge (AI literacy). Most of the current definitions of AI literacy for a non-technical audience are developed from an engineering perspective and may not be appropriate for K–12 education. Teacher perspectives are essential to making sense of this initiative. Literacy is about knowing (knowledge, what skills); competency is about applying the knowledge in a beneficial way (confidence, how well). They are strongly related. This study goes beyond knowledge (AI literacy), and its two main goals are to (i) define AI literacy and competency by adding the aspects of confidence and self-reflective mindsets, and (ii) propose a more comprehensive framework for K–12 AI education. These definitions are needed for this emerging and disruptive technology (e.g., ChatGPT and Sora, generative AI). We used the definitions and the basic curriculum design approaches as the analytical framework and teacher perspectives. Participants included 30 experienced AI teachers from 15 middle schools. We employed an iterative co-design cycle to discuss and revise the framework throughout four cycles. The definition of AI competency has five abilities that take confidence into account, and the proposed framework comprises five key components: technology, impact, ethics, collaboration, and self-reflection. We also identify five effective learning experiences to foster abilities and confidences, and suggest five future research directions: prompt engineering, data literacy, algorithmic literacy, self-reflective mindset, and empirical research.}

Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), as a representative of disruptive technological innovation, has reshaped traditional manufacturing processes and opened up a field of possibilities. This paper analyzes the practice of GAI technology in the production process and explores its interaction with product line design under two predominant distribution contracts. We focus on technological innovation factors, such as the impact of GAI technology on product popularity and the probability of a successful GAI-assisted design, and find that the effect of GAI technology on product popularity exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with both product quality and firm profit. Our work also demonstrates that a longer product line could incentivize the supplier to adopt GAI-assisted product design under both agency and wholesale contracts. We also show that GAI technology motivates the supplier to extend its product line. Finally, our extended analysis examines distribution contract choices in the presence of GAI technology and reveals that the platform favors an agency contract over a wholesale contract when the commission rate is either relatively low or high, the impact of GAI technology on product popularity is low, the probability of a successful GAI-assisted design is high, and the product line extension fee is moderate.}

From the features like vibration, temperature of the motor, pressure, and flow rate, the models categorize the state of the pump into two; normal or No Fault, and Fault Detected. This makes it possible to detect specific faults and assist in creating preventive maintenance. Post analysis, it was inferred that with an accuracy of 0.92, the SVM with a linear kernel outperformed the competing models. While the KNN performed marginally worse with an accuracy of 0.85, the SVM with RBF and polynomial kernels as well as logistic regression both attained accuracy of 0.91. These findings highlight the SVM with a linear kernel’s superior generalization skills, which make it the best option for pump system defect identification. For defect detection, giving the SVM with a linear kernel priority guarantees precise predictions, allowing for proactive maintenance and minimizing downtime. To improve operational efficiency and lower long-term maintenance costs, policy ideas include standardizing data collection techniques, investing in real-time monitoring systems, and implementing machine learning-based predictive maintenance across industries.}

Although photovoltaics (PVs) have limited efficiency, concentrating photovoltaic–thermal (CPV/T) systems generate electricity and heat simultaneously, achieving 60 to 80 % total efficiency, considerably higher than those obtained from PVs. However, the performance of CPV/T highly depends on operational parameters such as irradiance fluctuations, cell temperature, and tracking inaccuracies, limiting their use in real world applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques including deep neural networks (DNNs), reinforcement learning (RL), and hybrid algorithms solve these problems by enabling adaptive thermal regulation, fault detection, real-time optimization and precision solar tracking. This paper has reviewed recent progresses in AI, with special focus on CPV/T systems, analyzing approaches for dynamic cooling control, predictive maintenance, irradiance forecasting and system design. Experimental validations revealed that AI-driven control increased thermal stability by > 35, %decreased mirror misalignment by ≤ 85 %, and obtained R2 > 0.99 for energy prediction. However, serious limitations such as climate-specific model transferability, computational constraints in off-grid settings, interdisciplinary gaps between AI and solar engineering, and data scarcity still exist.

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into health care, including psychiatry and psychology. In educational contexts, AI offers new possibilities for enhancing clinical reasoning, personalizing content delivery, and supporting professional development. Despite this emerging interest, a comprehensive understanding of how AI is currently used in mental health education, and the challenges associated with its adoption, remains limited.
Objective
This scoping review aimed to identify and characterize current applications of AI in the teaching and learning of psychiatry and psychology. It also sought to document reported facilitators of and barriers to the integration of AI within educational contexts.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted across 6 electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, EBM Reviews, and Google Scholar) from inception to October 2024. The review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Studies were included if they focused on psychiatry or psychology, described the use of an AI tool, and discussed at least 1 facilitator of or barrier to its use in education. Data were extracted on study characteristics, population, AI application, educational outcomes, facilitators, and barriers. Study quality was appraised using several design-appropriate tools.
Results
From 6219 records, 10 (0.2%) studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight categories of AI applications were identified: clinical decision support, educational content creation, therapeutic tools and mental health monitoring, administrative and research assistance, natural language processing (NLP), program/policy development, students’ study aid, and professional development. Key facilitators included the availability of AI tools, positive learner attitudes, digital infrastructure, and time-saving features. Barriers included limited AI training, ethical concerns, lack of digital literacy, algorithmic opacity, and insufficient curricular integration. The overall methodological quality of included studies was moderate to high.
Conclusions
AI is being used across a range of educational functions in psychiatry and psychology, from clinical training to assessment and administrative support. Although the potential for enhancing learning outcomes is clear, its successful integration requires addressing ethical, technical, and pedagogical barriers. Future efforts should focus on AI literacy, faculty development, and institutional policies to guide responsible and effective use. This review underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure the safe, equitable, and meaningful adoption of AI in mental health education.}

This paper will view the rise of the e-patient, who is “equipped, enabled, empowered, and engaged” through the lens of the evolution of successive digital technology innovations, each building on its predecessors, creating new tools for patient empowerment. We begin with the dawn of the web and the proliferation of health websites and discuss the use of digital communication tools. We then discuss the adoption of electronic health records, which enabled the rise of patient portals. This digitization of health data, along with the rapid adoption of mobile internet access and the proliferation of health-related smartphone apps, in turn, provided a platform for patients to coproduce health care by contributing their own health data to their self-care and health care. The exchange of health information between patients and providers has also been facilitated by telehealth or telemedicine technology, which enables direct care delivery. The use of social networks in health, in use since the early days of the web, has expanded since COVID-19, when public health authorities worldwide, as well as patients, sought the use of social media channels to get connected and share information. Most recently, artificial intelligence and large language models have emerged with yet untapped potential to provide patients with the information that could improve their understanding of their conditions and treatment options. We conclude that innovations in digital health technology have symbiotically evolved with the ascendance of the e-patient, enabling improved communication, collaboration, and coordination between patients and clinicians and forging a health care system that is safer and more responsive to patient needs.}

Grounded in the Knowledge-Based View, we differentiate between AI application innovation and AI method innovation, analyzing their distinct environmental outcomes using data from Chinese-listed enterprises (2016–2021). Our findings reveal that AI application innovation follows a U-shaped relationship with environmental performance: early stages may lead to increased resource consumption and pollution, while positive effects emerge as adoption scales up. In contrast, AI method innovation consistently enhances environmental performance. The study further identifies the moderating role of enterprise size, showing that larger enterprises experience stronger positive effects from AI method innovation, while the U-shaped relationship of AI application innovation becomes flatter as enterprise size increases. These insights provide a nuanced understanding of AII's environmental implications, contributing to the literature by clarifying both linear and nonlinear effects. The findings offer practical guidance for enterprises to optimize AI strategies and advise policymakers on tailoring support measures to promote sustainable AI adoption across various organizational contexts.}

To address these limitations, computer vision and generative artificial intelligence (AI) have been explored. While computer vision has shown promise in automating safety monitoring, its effectiveness is often hindered by the challenges of efficiently collecting diverse datasets. Generative AI offers a potential solution by augmenting image datasets, enabling more robust construction hazard detection. This paper investigates the use of generative AI for augmenting image data to improve hazard detection performance. Various combinations of generative AI tools and prompting strategies are tested. The results show that the combination of image-guided structured prompting with Stable Diffusion achieves the highest detection performance (mAP@50 of 92.5 %) using 150 augmented images. This represents a substantial improvement compared to the baseline mAP@50 of 51.6 % achieved with real images alone.}

abstract = {Background
Social robots (SR), sensorimotor machines designed to interact with humans, can help to respond to the increasing demands in the health care sector. To ensure the successful use of this technology, acceptance is paramount. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology with the potential to enhance the functionality of SR and promote user acceptance by further improving human-robot interaction.
Objective
We present a protocol for a scoping review of the literature on the implementation of generative AI in SR in the health care sector. The aim of this scoping review is to map out the intersection of SR and generative AI in the health care sector; to explore if generative AI is applied in SR in the health care sector; to outline which models of generative AI and SR are used for these implementations; and to explore whether user acceptance is reported as an outcome following these implementations. This scoping review supports future research by providing an overview of the state of connectedness of 2 emerging technologies and by mapping out research gaps.
Methods
We follow the methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley and the recommendations by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Our protocol was drafted using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). We will conduct a systematic literature search of the online databases MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore, aiming to retrieve relevant data items via tabular data charting from references meeting specific inclusion criteria which are studies published from 2010 onwards, set in the health care sector, focusing on SR with physical bodies and implemented generative AI. There are no restrictions on study types. Results will be categorized, clustered, and summarized using tables, graphs, visual representations, and narratives.
Results
After conducting a preliminary search and deduplication in the second quarter of 2024, we retrieved 3176 preliminary results. This scoping review will be supplemented with the next methodological steps, including retrieving the results in a reference management tool as well as screening titles, abstracts, and full text regarding specific inclusion criteria. The completion of these steps is scheduled for the second quarter of 2025. Limitations based on the heterogeneity of the included studies and the general breadth of a scoping review compared to a systematic review are to be expected. To reduce bias, we adopted a system of dual reviews and thorough documentation of the study selection.
Conclusions

Currently available cloud-based AI platforms are mostly commercial – e.g. Amazon Web Services (AWS) –, requiring subscriptions that are not affordable for small to medium-scale farmers. Therefore, in this position paper, an AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) platform supporting multiple AI tasks with modern open-source tools integrable with PA systems is proposed, with the goal of enabling a cost-effective dissemination through farmers community and related professionals. This platform has already some fully functional modules that will be demonstrated on a PA sourced grapevines imagery, encompassing classification and segmentation tasks.}

abstract = {The extraterritorial application of artificial intelligence (AI) laws and regulations is a form of global AI governance. The EU and China serve as two different examples of how to achieve the extraterritorial applicability of AI laws and regulations. The former shows an explicit territorial extension with more trigger factors, whereas the latter shows vertical regulation with a narrower territorial scope. Both countries’ legislative motivations differ but also have some commonalities. One of the primary goals of extraterritorial application of domestic laws is to protect citizens within their territory. The digital economy's characteristics make it necessary for AI laws to have extraterritorial effects. Without international conventions or treaties, there is a legal vacuum in AI regulation. Additionally, the extraterritorial application of AI laws and regulations helps a state become a global standard-setter and gain an international sphere of influence. However, the extraterritorial application of AI laws and regulations sometimes functions as a form of legal imperialism. This exacerbates the injustice between great powers and weak countries in AI competition. To justify the legitimacy of the extraterritorial application of AI laws and regulations, it is beneficial to adopt the ‘inner morality of extraterritoriality’, a theoretical framework proposed by Professor Dan Svantesson. In fact, extraterritorial applicability depends on the market size and attractiveness. For other countries, whether their AI laws and regulations are endowed with extraterritorial effects is their prerogative. However, they should consider their soft power before implementing legislation.}

One emerging application of AI is in determining gender from these radiographs, a task traditionally performed by forensic experts using manual methods. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the accuracy of AI algorithms in gender determination using OPGs, focusing on the reliability and potential clinical and forensic applications of these technologies. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. The study included research articles that utilised AI algorithms for gender detection based on OPG images. Five major databases were searched, and studies were selected based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The analysis focused on studies that reported accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of AI models. Statistical analyses were performed using R software, including forest plots and funnel plots, to evaluate the diagnostic performance and potential publication bias. The meta-analysis included 13 studies, yielding a pooled accuracy estimate of 88.66%. The results demonstrated high specificity among the AI models, with some studies achieving accuracy rates as high as 99.20%. However, there was variability in sensitivity across different studies, indicating that some models are more reliable than others depending on the dataset and features used. The funnel plot analysis suggested slight asymmetry, indicating potential publication bias or heterogeneity. AI models show significant potential in accurately determining gender from OPG images, with some models achieving near-perfect accuracy. Continued research is needed to enhance model consistency and expand the applicability of these tools across different demographic groups.}

abstract = {A growing interest in education, media, and entertainment has increased Artificial Intelligence-powered content generation, mainly via Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which shape images, videos, audio, and text. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is the combination of two deep neural networks: generator (G) and discriminator (D). These two components are trained competitively by pitting one against the other such that G generates new data while D authenticates the data. By leveraging powerful deep neural networks and competitive training, GANs can synthesize reasonable and realistic images and videos from the text description. This paper extensively reviews the recent state-of-the-art GAN models for text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) synthesis. In this regard, databases like ACM, IEEE Explore, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect were searched to find and analyze the relevant research articles conducted in this area in the last decade, specifically from 2014 to 2024. Secondly, T2I and T2V GAN methods were classified according to structure and functionality. Later, a comprehensive evaluation between T2I and T2V GAN-based methods was conducted, employing various qualitative and quantitative evaluation techniques. Finally, the paper concludes by discussing multiple applications, main challenges, and limitations of T2I and T2V GAN models for future consideration.}

abstract = {Traditional ultrasound methods, particularly cardiac echocardiography, depend predominantly on evidence-based decision trees and risk-scoring systems to guide and standardise clinical decision-making. Although these approaches demonstrate some effectiveness, their inherent rigidity and failure to address non-linear interactions lead to inadequate consideration of individual variability, thereby compromising diagnostic accuracy and consistency. Furthermore, these conventional techniques are vulnerable to human bias, which increases the risk of misdiagnosis. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI)-based analytical strategies substantially overcome these limitations using machine and deep learning methodologies. Furthermore, AI can autonomously annotate, measure, and evaluate cardiac function, significantly minimising human error, while enhancing diagnostic precision and reliability. In addition, AI can quickly process extensive volumes of imaging data and efficiently quantify cardiovascular pathological features, thereby improving the efficacy and accuracy of cardiovascular disease diagnosis. AI is widely applied in various areas of cardiac echocardiography, including image classification, disease screening, and automated measurements. Given the increasing integration of AI into cardiac echocardiography practices, we present a comprehensive review of the advantages of AI strategies and their practical applications, aiming to provide profound insights that may help promote automated intelligent analysis of echocardiography.}

The system was modeled using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) and optimized via Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on 11 decision variables. To address the complexity of optimization, a second phase applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques: Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) for predictive modelling and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for global optimization. Under optimal conditions, the Response Surface Methodology yielded an exergy efficiency of 45.8 % with a cost rate of 576.76 United States Dollars per hour (USD/h), while AI reduced costs to 211.2 USD/h with a moderate efficiency trade-off. Simulation of the optimized configuration across eight diverse climates identified Quebec as most viable, generating 22,629.6 Megawatt-hours per year (MWh/year) of electricity and avoiding 4616.4 tons of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions annually. Integration of wind energy stabilizes solar variability, enhancing performance. AI contributes to optimizing complex interactions, nonlinear constraints, and multiple conflicting objectives. The methodology offers a scalable, generalizable framework for designing intelligent, climate-resilient infrastructures. Future research includes AI-enabled real-time control, experimental validation, and broader deployment strategies.}

Finally, through necessity analysis, configurational analysis, and robustness testing of these six factors, the paper reveals that technology-resource driven, policy-actor coordinated, and government-resource mediated implementation configurations can effectively achieve high-level governance efficiency in GAI policies and regulations.

Chronic diseases represent a significant global burden of mortality, exacerbated by behavioral risk factors. Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed health promotion and disease reduction through improved early detection, encouraging healthy lifestyle modifications, and mitigating the economic strain on health systems.
Objective
The aim of this study is to investigate how AI contributes to health promotion and disease reduction among Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.
Methods
We conducted a rapid review of the literature to identify the latest evidence on how AI is used in health promotion and disease reduction. We applied comprehensive search strategies formulated for MEDLINE (OVID) and CINAHL to locate studies published between 2019 and 2024. A pair of reviewers independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to screen the titles and abstracts, assess the full texts, and extract the data. We synthesized extracted data from the study characteristics, intervention characteristics, and intervention purpose using structured narrative summaries of main themes, giving a portrait of the current scope of available AI initiatives used in promoting healthy activities and preventing disease.
Results
We included 22 studies in this review (out of 3442 publications screened), most of which were conducted in the United States (10/22, 45%) and focused on health promotion by targeting lifestyle dimensions, such as dietary behavior (10/22, 45%), smoking cessation (6/22, 27%), physical activity (4/22, 18%), and mental health (3/22, 14%). Three studies targeted disease reduction related to metabolic health (eg, obesity, diabetes, hypertension). Most AI initiatives were AI-powered mobile apps. Overall, positive results were reported for process outcomes (eg, acceptability, engagement), cognitive and behavioral outcomes (eg, confidence, step count), and health outcomes (eg, glycemia, blood pressure). We categorized the challenges, benefits, and suggestions identified in the studies using a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis to inform future developments. Key recommendations include conducting further investigations, taking into account the needs of end users, improving the technical aspect of the technology, and allocating resources.
Conclusions
These findings offer critical insights into the effective implementation of AI for health promotion and disease prevention, potentially guiding policymakers and health care practitioners in optimizing the use of AI technologies in supporting health promotion and disease reduction.

abstract = {Among various clinical skills, critical thinking (CT) is foundational for quality patient care. However, existing literature suggests deficiencies in applying analytical reasoning skills in healthcare education. As CT integration gains momentum in dentistry, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies introduces new dynamics. This article explores the potential impacts of emerging technologies of AI on the development and application of CT in the dental profession.
Methods
A narrative literature review of English-language publications was conducted using sources such as PubMed, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Wiley-Online-Library, and Oral-Health-Group. Our review focused on relevant articles published up to June 30,2024, representing a peak period of CT awareness. The search terms used included: “Critical thinking,” “healthcare,” “rubric,” “dental education,” and “Artificial intelligence.” No inclusion or exclusion criteria were applied. The search strategies aimed to synthesize collective healthcare experience in implementing CT in education, providing a cohesive understanding of the current state of CT and highlighting gaps in its integration in education.
Results
Strategies for incorporating CT into dental education are still developing. Although dental educators recognize the importance of CT-based curricula, barriers hinder effective implementation. Additionally, the rise of advanced technologies with human-like cognitive and non-cognitive capabilities necessitates agile, adaptable strategies to integrate CT in dental education. A simplified model is proposed for integrating AI into the development of CT skills at multiple levels in dental education. Furthermore, a rubric for assessing CT skills in problem-based learning is presented.
Conclusion
This review emphasizes the urgent need to strategically prioritize CT integration in dental education. Inadequate application of CT may increase the risk of AI misuse, and overreliance on AI could potentially undermine clinical decision-making. We propose that emerging technologies should be embraced as tools to enhance the development of CT skills while mitigating potential negative impacts. Plausible approaches to addressing this challenge are outlined.}

abstract = {Executive summary
Like all sectors, the movie industry has been both affected by and exploring potential uses of generative Artificial Intelligence ('AI'). On the one hand, movie studios have detected and begun to add warnings against unlicensed third-party uses of their content, including for AI training,11W Cho, ‘Universal Pictures to Big Tech: We’ll sue if you steal our movies for AI’ (6 August 2025) The Hollywood Reporter, available at https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/universal-pictures-big-tech-well-sue-if-you-steal-movies-ai-1236337712/. and have taken enforcement initiatives through court action. On the other hand, the use of AI within and by the industry itself has been growing. Regarding the latter, some have emphasised the opportunities presented by the implementation of AI, including by advancing claims that AI tools can offer a `purer' form of expression. Others have instead warned against the potential displacement of industry workers, including workers employed in technical roles and younger and emerging actors. Against the background illustrated above, this study maps and critically evaluates relevant issues facing the development, deployment, and use of AI models from a movie industry perspective. The legal analysis is conducted having regard to EU and UK copyright law and is divided into three parts:•Input/AI training: By considering relevant legal restrictions applicable to the training of AI models on protected audiovisual content, the border between lawful unlicensed uses and restricted uses is drawn;•Protectability of AI-generated outputs: Turning to the output generation phase, the protectability of such outputs is considered next, by focusing in particular on the requirements of authorship and originality under EU and UK copyright law;•Legal risks and potential liability stemming from the use of third-party AI models for output generation: Still having regard to the output generation phase, relevant legal issues that might arise having regard to the use of AI models that `regurgitate' third-party training data at output generation are considered, alongside the question of style protection under copyright. The main conclusions are as follows:•Input/AI training: Insofar as model training on third-party protected content is concerned, there are no exceptions under EU/UK law that fully cover the entirety of these processes. As a result, lacking legislative reform, the establishment of a licensing framework appears unavoidable for such activities to be deemed lawful;•Protectability of AI-generated outputs: The deployment of AI across various phases of the creative process does not render the resulting content unprotectable, provided that human involvement and control remain significant throughout, with the result that AI is relied upon as a tool that aids – rather than replaces – the creativity of industry workers.•Legal risks and potential liability stemming from the use of third-party AI models for output generation: The use of AI models that generate infringing outputs, such as by regurgitating input data or merely imitating style, may trigger the application of exclusive rights under copyright and related rights. The resulting liability may vest with the user of such models, as well as the model developer/provider. The latter aspect means that terms that exclude any such liability may ultimately be found to be unenforceable against users and ineffective against rightholders.}
