abstract = {An important application of artificial intelligence (AI) is to facilitate the implementation of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) across complex and multi-tiered value chains. Solving the challenges faced by (un)sustainable practices in global industries has become a priority for corporate actors, states, and civil society, legitimized by both ethical and legal arguments. In fisheries, mining, plastics, and forestry, despite its potential to improve ESG practices, AI technologies also risk furthering consumption practices, thus negatively affecting socio-economic and environmental sustainability. We highlight the potential for direct positive impacts of AI on each of the environmental, social, and governance mechanisms throughout the four industries. However, we also point to the risks that indirect impacts of AI-powered tools entail on ESG practices and the potential for industries to disconnect themselves from these indirect impacts. Finally, we suggest that the widespread use of AI to optimize consumption processes, without questioning overconsumption patterns, risks creating unsustainable practices at the global level.}

abstract = {Agriculture is a vital sector contributing to food security and economic growth, but it faces significant hurdles in food production due to declining crop yields, with plant diseases being a key factor. Moreover, early detection of plant diseases remains a major challenge due to class imbalance in datasets and the difficulty in identifying initial symptoms. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes a novel lightweight dynamic model called DynLeafNet, a deep learning-based architecture specifically designed for efficient and accurate recognition of plant disease. DynLeafNet leverages residual Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) enhanced with advanced dynamic techniques such as Learned Group Convolutions (LGConv), Early Exiting, and Grid Search to optimize performance and computational efficiency. Moreover, the proposed model uses data augmentation to address the Class Imbalance Problem (CIP) by calculating class weights in the datasets. The efficacy of the DynLeafNet model is validated using the publicly available PlantVillage and Rice Leaf Disease datasets, where it demonstrated superior accuracy and reduced computational cost (calculated in terms of Floating Point Operations per Second (FLOPs)) compared to existing state-of-the-art models. For the PlantVillage dataset, DynLeafNet achieved a training accuracy of 99.34%, a testing accuracy of 98.33%, and a computational complexity of 17.64M FLOPs. For the Rice Leaf Disease dataset, the model achieved a training accuracy of 97.81%, a testing accuracy of 95.64%, and a computational complexity of 35.07M FLOPs. In addition, single image prediction is performed using Gradient Weighted Class Activation Mapping ++ (Grad-CAM ++), to visualize the model’s focus areas and enhance interpretability.}

These applications include the wind turbine (WT)-driven doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) arrangements, particularly grid-tied DFIG; power converter design efficiency; and digital twin systems and economics. The use of AI in grid-tied DFIG and its power converter design and optimisation is being fueled by an increasing amount of pertinent RES operational data sets, high-performance computer resources, improved AI tools, and advancements in predicting control. These factors enable an increasing return on investment for system owners and operators. Modern AI technologies are driven by four principal methodologies: expert systems, fuzzy logic systems, metaheuristic systems, and machine and deep learning. The value maximization of WT-driven DFIG systems will soon depend on an AI architecture that will synergize the power converter electronic device, the edge (DFIG system/array controllers), and the cloud (for AI training and ML support). Including ML capabilities in the DFIG array controllers will help enable continuous advancements in power generation optimisation and open up more advanced grid-interactive features. These controllers will gather real-time data for AI inference engines (perhaps based on predictive neural logic) and the device-level inverters and transport the data to the cloud for more sophisticated ML tasks. This review briefly discusses how the growing interest in AI/ML is utilised in power converter design and its optimisation to overcome the grid-tied wind turbine-driven DFIG availability and efficiency issues.

abstract = {Background
Virtual staining is an artificial intelligence-based approach that transforms pathology images between stain types, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to immunohistochemistry (IHC), providing a tissue-preserving and efficient alternative to traditional IHC staining. However, existing methods for translating H&E to virtual IHC often fail to generate images of sufficient quality for accurately delineating cell nuclei and IHC+ regions. To address these limitations, we introduce VISTA, an artificial intelligence-based virtual staining platform designed to translate H&E into virtual IHC.
Methods
We applied VISTA to identify M2-subtype tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs) in H&E images from 968 patients with HPV+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma across six institutional cohorts. M2-TAMs are a critical component of the tumor microenvironment, and their increased presence has been linked to poor survival. Co-registered H&E and CD163 + IHC tissue microarrays were used to train (D1, N = 102) and test (D2, N = 50) the VISTA platform. M2-TAM density, defined as the ratio of M2-TAMs to total nuclei, was derived from VISTA-generated CD163 + IHC images and evaluated for prognostic significance in additional training (D3, N = 360) and testing (D4, N = 456) cohorts using biopsy or resection H&E whole slide images.
Results
High M2-TAM density was associated with worse overall survival in D4 (p = 0.0152, Hazard Ratio=1.63 [1.1–2.42]). VISTA outperformed existing methods, generating higher-quality virtual CD163 + IHC images in D2, with a Structural Similarity Index of 0.72, a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio of 21.5, and a Fréchet Inception Distance of 41.4. Additionally, VISTA demonstrated superior performance in segmenting M2-TAMs in D2 (Dice=0.74).
Conclusion
These findings establish VISTA as a computational platform for generating virtual IHC and facilitating the discovery of novel biomarkers from H&E images.}

abstract = {Purpose
A gripping keyword emerged in the dynamic world of 2022: GPT or the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), at its forefront, embodied by the mysterious ChatGPT. This technological marvel had been silently lurking in the background for just over five years. However, all of a sudden, it emerged onto the scene, capturing the public’s attention and quickly becoming one of the most widely adopted inventions in history. Therefore, this narrative review is conducted in order to explore the impact of generative AI and ChatGPT on lifelong learning and upskilling of students in higher education and address opportunities and challenges proposed by Artificial Intelligence from a global perspective.
Design/methodology/approach
This review has been conducted using a narrative literature review approach. For in-depth identification of research gaps, 105 relevant articles were included from scholarly databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, ERIC and Google Scholar. Seven major themes emerged from the literature to answer the targeted research questions that describe the use of AI, the impact of generative AI and ChatGPT on students, the challenges and opportunities of using AI in education and mitigating strategies to cope with the challenges associated with the integration of ChatGPT and generative AI in education.
Findings
The review of the literature presents that generative AI and ChatGPT have gained a lot of recognition among students and have revolutionized educational settings. The findings suggest that there are some contexts in which adult education research and teaching can benefit from the use of chatbots and generative AI technologies like ChatGPT. The literature does, however, also highlight the necessity of carefully considering the benefits and drawbacks of these technologies in order to prevent restricting or distorting the educational process or endangering academic integrity. In addition, the literature raises ethical questions about data security, privacy and cheating by students or researchers. To these, we add our own ethical concerns about intellectual property, such as the fact that, once we enter ideas or research results into a generative chatbot, we no longer have control over how it is used.
Practical implications
This review is helpful for educators and policymakers to design the curriculum and policies that encourage students to use generative AI ethically while taking academic integrity into account. Also, this review article identifies the major gaps that are associated with the impact of AI and ChatGPT on the lifelong learning skills of students.
Originality/value
This review of the literature is unique because it explains the challenges and opportunities of using generative AI and ChatGPT, also defining its impact on lifelong learning and upskilling of students.}

abstract = {Background & aims
Mitochondrial (mt-) D-loop and cell-free circulating (ccf-) mtDNA fragments, respectively reflecting mt-mass and tissue damage, are promising metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) biomarkers. We previously found that PNPLA3/MBOAT7/TM6SF2 deficiency in HepG2 cells increased mt-mass, D-loop levels, and ccf-COXIII release. We explored mt-biogenesis and mt-biomarkers in patients with MASLD stratified by the number of risk variants (NRV = 3). We exploited GPT-4 to develop and validate new risk scores, predicting MASLD evolution, in two independent cohorts by integrating anthropometric and genetic data with mt-biomarkers.
Methods
A cohort of 28 patients with MASLD (Discovery cohort) was consecutively enrolled for hepatic mt-dynamics assessment by transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Data were confirmed by quantitative real time-PCR in a retrospective cohort (Hepatic Validation, n = 184). D-loop and ccf-COXIII were retrospectively measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum samples of biopsied outpatients with MASLD (Serum Validation cohort, n = 824) and individuals with non-invasive MASLD diagnosis (n = 386, Non-invasive cohort). Risk scores were developed using random forest algorithms.
Results
In the Discovery and Hepatic Validation cohorts, the PNPLA3/MBOAT7/TM6SF2 variants altered hepatic mt-dynamics, enhancing mt-content and D-loop levels (p <0.05) through the p38/PGC-1α pathway. Furthermore, NRV = 3 patients showed an increase in mt-fragmentation at transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and ccf-COXIII release (p <0.05). In the Serum Validation cohort, circulating D-loop and ccf-COXIII positively correlated with genetics [βD-loop:0.17 (95% CI: 0.04–0.29), p = 0.01; βccf-COXIII:0.33 (95% CI: 0.19–0.46), p <0.0001] and MASLD severity [ORD-loop:1.31 (95% CI: 1.01-1.71), p = 0.03; ORccf-COXIII:2.41 (95% CI: 1.69-3.44), p <0.0001] at multivariate analysis. Random forest allowed prediction models named Mitochondrial, Anthropometric, and Genetic Integration with Computational intelligence for assessing hepatocellular carcinoma risk (MAGIC-H), considering age, BMI genetics, D-loop, and ccf-COXIII. In both Serum and Non-invasive cohorts, the MAGIC-H score reached AUC >85% in identifying HCC cases regardless of cirrhosis, outperforming existing non-invasive tests.
Conclusions
Mt-biomarkers have a prognostic significance in genetically-predisposed patients with MASLD.
Impact and implications
The study highlights that genetic variants in PNPLA3, MBOAT7, and TM6SF2 genes deeply contribute to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) progression by affecting hepatic mitochondrial adaptability. It also identified two novel biomarkers of mitochondrial origin which are strongly linked to disease severity and genetic background of patients with MASLD. The use of generative artificial intelligence tools, such as GPT-4, can enhance the use of biomarkers and polygenic risk scores for clinical risk stratification. We developed a customized version of GPT-4 (rsGPT-4), which identified a machine-learning approach (random forest) as the best method for creating prediction models for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The new scores combined the two mitochondrial biomarkers, genetic data, and anthropometric data and outperformed existing non-invasive tests for monitoring patients with MASLD.}

This process commonly involves fabricating porous products constructed from lattice structures comprising numerous unit cells. These lattice structures have gained popularity for their capacity to reduce weight and material consumption while preserving specific mechanical strength. However, optimizing their elastic properties requires a thorough understanding of how unit cell design influences the overall performance of these structures. This study introduces a novel approach combining finite element simulations with machine learning (ML) to predict and analyze the elastic moduli of two-dimensional triangular lattice structures. Using the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm, an ML model was developed to predict moduli based on simulation data, aiming to establish a precise relationship between relative density and elastic moduli. A key objective is to provide an efficient estimation tool for researchers and engineers, verified through comparisons with existing closed-form solutions and experimental data. To enhance trust in predictions, Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations and Partial Dependence Plots, were employed to interpret the model's outputs and identify influential design variables. Findings revealed a non-linear relationship between relative density and elastic moduli, with ML models achieving high predictive accuracy. This approach offers valuable insights for optimizing lattice structures across diverse applications, emphasizing the critical design features influencing their elastic behavior.}

Applying three machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and artificial neural networks (ANN) to this refined dataset showed that the artificial neural networks outperformed the competing models with an accuracy of 0.84, largely due to its capacity to represent complicated, non-linear relationships. With an accuracy of 0.79, SVM proved its validity despite feature dependencies, whereas Naive Bayes attained 0.76.

abstract = {Purpose
This paper aims to determine the entrepreneur's intention to accept artificial intelligence (AI) and provide advancement in the domain of digital entrepreneurship.
Design/methodology/approach
Extensive literature review and theories have been considered in the area of technology adoption/acceptance and digital entrepreneurship to identify the factors affecting the intention of entrepreneurs with respect to accept AI for digital entrepreneurship. Further, a model, artificial intelligence acceptance and digital entrepreneurship (AIADE) is theorized after formulating some hypotheses. The theorized model has been validated with 476 useable responses.
Findings
The findings revealed that performance expectancy, openness, social influence, hedonic motivations and generativity have a positive impact on entrepreneur's acceptance intention of AI. Additionally, affordance has no direct relationship with AI acceptance intention, but it affects AI acceptance intention through attitude. Inconvenience has a significant negative relationship with the intention to accept AI, while uncertainty was found to be positively affecting the AI acceptance intention. Effort expectancy did not confirm any significant relationship.
Research limitations/implications
By considering existing theoretical models and concepts the authors contribute to the AI's theoretical progress, specifically in the domain of entrepreneurship. The authors complement and extend existing technology adoption/acceptance theories and digital entrepreneurship theories by developing a theoretical model, AIADE, explaining the entrepreneur's intention to accept AI.
Practical implications
The practical implications of the study show that performance expectancy (positive), openness (positive), social influence (positive), hedonic motivations (positive), generativity (positive), affordance through attitude (positive), uncertainty (positive), effort expectancy (negative) and inconvenience (negative) are the antecedents for the entrepreneurs to accept AI for digital entrepreneurship. The authors suggest that intentional improvement planning is developed by increasing entrepreneur's positive perceptions of AI affordance and explanation of its generativity and openness, and improving their attitude of using AI for digital entrepreneurship.
Originality/value
This is the first study that reveals the critical antecedents of entrepreneur's intention to accept AI for digital entrepreneurship. Relevant theoretical background, discussion, implications, limitations and future research recommendations are discussed.}

This research aims to identify pathways for balancing energy efficiency improvements with low-carbon transitions to enhance energy security. Existing studies have explored the impact on energy efficiency during the development of AI technology applications narrowly. To address this gap, this paper analyzes China’s provincial energy efficiency from 2010 to 2019 from three aspects: energy consumption, desired output, and undesired output. Empirical analysis shows AI technology applications can significantly boost energy efficiency by cutting energy consumption and undesired outputs, helping improve energy security. However, in the short term, these applications show no significant impact on macroeconomic output. Concurrently, Urbanization level exerts a favorable moderating effect on this process. Furthermore, AI technology applications impacts on energy efficiency are more pronounced in low-energy consuming regions and in the South. These findings offer in-depth insights into how AI technology applications enhance energy security through energy efficiency and pollution reduction and provide guidance for improving energy policies and enabling scientific decision-making in different Chinese regions.}

abstract = {The increasingly complicated urban traffic patterns lead traffic signal control to a new trend of higher flexibility and quicker response, which becomes possible with advances in both sensor technology and artificial intelligence. Though in its early stage, existing intelligent signal controllers equipped with reinforcement learning (RL)-based feature extractor and large language model (LLM)-driven scenario understanding and decision support already demonstrate powerful data digesting ability. This study thus proposes a smart traffic light control system integrating a vision-based perception tool to extract traffic state from real-time snapshot image of the intersection, and an LLM agent controller for signal phase switching upon scenario analysis. An indicator describing the urgency for green time at phase level is defined to abstract the contextual information regarding the competition of multiple approaching traffic flows, which augments the LLM with domain-specific logical reasoning for signal control action generation, aimed at assigning green time to the flows with the most compelling needs. With a RL-based controller providing initial control decision as backup, the proposed method is able to handle both pre-trained and out-of-distribution scenarios through real-time traffic state diagnosis and knowledgeable reasoning. Simulation evaluation on different intersection layouts and vehicle compositions is conducted with horizontal comparison of five benchmarks. A decrease in average waiting time was realized by more than 5 % under normal traffic scenario and 20 % under emergency vehicle scenario, respectively. Further, comprehensive analysis was conducted to explore the applicability of the proposed method and feasibility for real-world application in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based intelligent traffic management.}

abstract = {The rapid integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into daily activities has prompted significant interest in understanding its impact on individuals. This paper addresses the critical gap in research concerning individual-level changes resulting from direct collaboration with GenAI systems. A novel theoretical framework is proposed, encompassing three primary constructs: Cognitive Dependency, Emotional Appraisal, and Behavioral Shift. These constructs are grounded in established theories such as Social Cognitive Theory, Cognitive Load Theory, and the Technology Acceptance Model, providing a comprehensive perspective on the mechanisms driving human transformation through GenAI collaboration. Empirical evidence is drawn from diverse case studies across education, professional environments, creative industries, social media, and the medical field, illustrating how increased cognitive dependency on GenAI leads to significant behavioral shifts, moderated by Emotional Appraisal. The analysis confirms the presence of feedback loops, where behavioral shifts further reinforce cognitive dependency, highlighting the sustained impact of GenAI on individuals. Key findings indicate that while GenAI enhances efficiency and creativity, it also poses risks such as skill degradation and reduced critical thinking. The implications extend to theoretical advancements in human-AI interaction research and practical applications for educators, organizations, and policymakers. Recommendations include integrating Artificial Intelligence literacy in education, developing balanced professional practices, and establishing ethical guidelines to mitigate biases and foster trust in GenAI systems. This paper underscores the necessity for ongoing research and ethical considerations to ensure that GenAI serves as a tool for human enhancement, promoting positive individual and societal outcomes.}

AI chatbots, powered by large data models, have emerged as a crucial tool for enhancing customer service and user experience. This study aims to investigate the impact of AI chatbot problem-solving capabilities on users’ intention to continue using these services within e-commerce platforms. By integrating elements from the Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), a comprehensive research model is proposed to examine the relationships between problem-solving, confirmation, perceived ease of use, satisfaction, trust, and continued usage intention. The study employs structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse data collected from 315 participants through an online questionnaire. The findings reveal that problem-solving abilities positively influence users’ confirmation, which in turn positively affects satisfaction, perceived ease of use, and trust. Furthermore, perceived ease of use exhibits a positive impact on satisfaction, trust, and continued usage intention. Satisfaction and trust have a positive impact on continued usage intention, with satisfaction showing a stronger influence than both problem-solving ability and ease of use. The study contributes to the theoretical understanding of user perceptions and behaviours in AI-driven interactions within e-commerce platforms. It highlights the importance of problem-solving capabilities, perceived ease of use, satisfaction, and trust in driving users’ continued engagement with AI chatbots. Practical implications for AI technology developers and e-commerce companies are discussed, emphasizing the need to focus on enhancing chatbots’ problem-solving proficiency and user-friendliness to foster long-term user retention. Future research directions are proposed, addressing the study’s limitations and exploring the generalizability of the findings beyond the e-commerce context.}

abstract = {Background
Defining optimal therapeutic sequencing strategies in prostate cancer (PC) is challenging and may be assisted by artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools for an analysis of the medical literature.
Objective
To demonstrate that INSIDE PC can help clinicians query the literature on therapeutic sequencing in PC and to develop previously unestablished practices for evaluating the outputs of AI-based support platforms.
Design, setting, and participants
INSIDE PC was developed by customizing PubMed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Publications were ranked and aggregated for relevance using data visualization and analytics. Publications returned by INSIDE PC and PubMed were given normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) scores by PC experts reflecting ranking and relevance.
Intervention
INSIDE PC for AI-based semantic literature analysis.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis
INSIDE PC was evaluated for relevance and accuracy for three test questions on the efficacy of therapeutic sequencing of systemic therapies in PC.
Results and limitations
In this initial evaluation, INSIDE PC outperformed PubMed for question 1 (novel hormonal therapy [NHT] followed by NHT) for the top five, ten, and 20 publications (nDCG score, +43, +33, and +30 percentage points [pps], respectively). For question 2 (NHT followed by poly [adenosine diphosphate ribose] polymerase inhibitors [PARPi]), INSIDE PC and PubMed performed similarly. For question 3 (NHT or PARPi followed by 177Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen-617), INSIDE PC outperformed PubMed for the top five, ten, and 20 publications (+16, +4, and +5 pps, respectively).
Conclusions
We applied INSIDE PC to develop standards for evaluating the performance of AI-based tools for literature extraction. INSIDE PC performed competitively with PubMed and can assist clinicians with therapeutic sequencing in PC.
Patient summary
The medical literature is often very difficult for doctors and patients to search. In this report, we describe INSIDE PC—an artificial intelligence (AI) system created to help search articles published in medical journals and determine the best order of treatments for advanced prostate cancer in a much better time frame. We found that INSIDE PC works as well as another search tool, PubMed, a widely used resource for searching and retrieving articles published in medical journals. Our work with INSIDE PC shows new ways in which AI can be used to search published articles in medical journals and how these systems might be evaluated to support shared decision-making.}

At the same time, should an accident occur at nuclear power plants, such as a nuclear leak, the consequences can be more severe than those associated with traditional power generation facilities. Therefore, Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) has been an important technology in nuclear power plants. Traditional FDD methods mostly rely on the precise mathematical system model, which can be sometimes difficult to obtain in reality, and the detection accuracy of existing methods is thus limited. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, FDD methods based on AI have been widely used. In this work, we make a systematic review of AI-based FDD methods, in conjunction with the introduction of the traditional FDD methods, and present the corresponding application scenarios of them. We hope that this work will help researchers incorporate more advanced AI models in nuclear power plants FDD and enlighten those interested in this field.}

abstract = {Background
Facial biometric data, while valuable for clinical applications, poses substantial privacy and security risks.
Objective
This paper aims to address the privacy and security concerns related to facial biometric data and support auxiliary diagnoses, in pursuit of which we developed Digital FaceDefender, an artificial intelligence–driven privacy safeguard solution.
Methods
We constructed a diverse set of digitally synthesized Asian face avatars representing both sexes, spanning ages 5 to 85 years in 10-year increments, using 70,000 facial images and 13,061 Asian face images. Landmark data were separately extracted from both patient and avatar images. Affine transformations ensured spatial alignment, followed by color correction and Gaussian blur to enhance fusion quality. For auxiliary diagnosis, we established 95% CIs for pixel distances within the eye region on a cohort of 1163 individuals, serving as diagnostic benchmarks. Reidentification risk was assessed using the ArcFace model, applied to 2500 images reconstructed via Detailed Expression Capture and Animation (DECA). Finally, Cohen Kappa analyses (n=114) was applied to assess agreement between diagnostic benchmarks and ophthalmologists’ evaluations.
Results
Compared to the DM method, Digital FaceDefender significantly reduced facial similarity scores (FDface vs raw images: 0.31; FLAME_FDface vs raw images: 0.09) and achieved zero Rank-1 accuracy in Pose #2-#3 and Pose #2-#5, with near-zero accuracy in Pose #4 (0.02) and Pose #5 (0.04), confirming lower reidentification risk. Cohen Kappa analysis demonstrated moderate agreement between our benchmarks and ophthalmologists’ assessments for the left eye (κ=0.37) and right eye (κ=0.45; both P<.001), validating diagnostic reliability of the benchmarks. Furthermore, the user-friendly Digital FaceDefender platform has been established and is readily accessible for use.
Conclusions
In summary, Digital FaceDefender effectively balances privacy protection and diagnostic use.}

To understand current use of artificial intelligence (AI), perceptions of AI, and areas of preferred future AI development for disabled adults.
Design
Data collection of disabled adults on their current use of AI, perceptions of AI, and areas of preferred future AI development. Data sampling was through the Accessibility User Research Collective, a nationally representative panel of 1532 disabled adults across the United States.
Setting
Study respondents completed an online self-administered survey in February of 2024.
Participants
Disabled adults (N=335) from the Accessibility User Research Collective.
Interventions
None.
Main Outcome Measures
Disabled adults’ use and perceptions of AI in a series of contexts including current use, barriers and facilitators to use, trust of AI, and ideal future development areas of AI.
Results
Use of AI: Adults with disabilities use AI for communication in multiple ways, with the most used being personal virtual assistants (80.90%), followed by customer service chatbots (61.79%), and conversational generative AI (57.01%). Adults with disabilities often use AI for creativity and enhancement, with over half of disabled adults using AI via search engines (83.28%), text editing (72.24%), predictive text (69.25%), consumer recommendations (66.57%), and social media feeds (54.03%). Improve Lives: A vast majority (87.4%) of people with disabilities agreed that AI has the potential to improve the lives of people with disabilities. Trust of AI: People with disabilities have a generally neutral position on trust in relation to AI (47.7%); however, of those that trust AI (25.2%) and of those that do not trust AI (27.0%), there was a slightly higher percentage of 1.8% that distrust AI. People who trust AI note that accessibility and company reputation are key drivers of their trust, more so than people who distrust AI. People who distrust AI are more commonly driven by concerns for data privacy, news and media reports, transparency of AI decision making, and other factors than people who trust AI. The accuracy of AI and previous experiences with AI do not have a different prevalence for those who do and do not trust AI. Future AI Development Interest: 96.36% of disabled adults have an interest in future AI development, with deep interest in development for communication (71.82%), household chores and general maintenance (62.42%), health and wellness (62.12%), and hobbies/leisure activities (60.61%).
Conclusions
Disabled adults use AI regularly and think AI is beneficial, and future developments should focus on communication, household needs, health, and hobbies.

abstract = {Background
Patient-ventilator asynchronies (PVAs) are frequent complications in mechanically ventilated patients, contributing to adverse outcomes such as ventilator-induced lung injury, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and increased mortality. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing PVA detection, prediction, and optimization. Despite its growing potential, the full scope of AI applications in this field and persistent gaps in evidence remain inadequately explored.
Objective
This scoping review examines the breadth of AI-based approaches for managing PVAs, identifying key methodologies, evaluating research trends, and highlighting limitations in the current literature.
Methods
A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, and the Cochrane Library without time restrictions. Extracted data included study objectives, AI methodologies, patient populations, performance metrics, and clinical outcomes. The findings were synthesized into thematic categories to map advancements and research gaps.
Results
Twenty-six studies were identified that applied AI techniques to detect, predict, or optimize PVAs. The included studies employed a range of AI methodologies, including convolutional neural networks, long short-term memory networks, and hybrid algorithms. These models demonstrated high predictive performance, with accuracy ranging from 87 % to 99 % and AUROC values exceeding 0.98 for detecting complex asynchronous events. AI systems also showed promise in predicting weaning success and optimizing ventilatory settings through real-time patient-specific adjustments. However, challenges such as reliance on single-center datasets, inconsistencies in calibration, and limited implementation of explainable AI frameworks restrict their clinical applicability.
Conclusions
AI holds transformative potential in managing PVAs by enabling real-time detection, improved weaning prediction, and personalized ventilatory strategies. However, significant challenges remain, particularly the need for multi-center validation, standardized reporting protocols, and randomized controlled trials to evaluate clinical efficacy. Addressing these gaps is essential for integrating AI into routine critical care practice and transitioning from theoretical models to practical, real-world applications in intensive care units.}

abstract = {Background
The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents unprecedented opportunities to redefine conceptions of personhood and cognitive disability, potentially enhancing the inclusion and participation of individuals with cognitive disabilities in society.
Objective
We aim to explore the transformative potential of GenAI in reshaping perceptions of cognitive disability, dismantling societal barriers, and promoting social participation for individuals with cognitive disabilities.
Methods
This study is a critical review of current literature in disability studies, artificial intelligence (AI) ethics, and computer science, integrating insights from disability theories and the philosophy of technology. The analysis focused on 2 key aspects: GenAI as a social mirror reflecting societal values and biases, and GenAI as a cognitive partner for individuals with cognitive disabilities.
Results
This paper proposes a theoretical framework for understanding the impact of GenAI on perceptions of cognitive disability. It introduces the concepts of GenAI as a “social mirror” that reflects and potentially amplifies societal biases and as a “cognitive copilot” providing personalized assistance in daily tasks, social interactions, and environmental navigation. This paper also presents a novel protocol for developing AI systems tailored to the needs of individuals with cognitive disabilities, emphasizing user involvement, ethical considerations, and the need to address both the opportunities and challenges posed by GenAI.
Conclusions
Although GenAI has great potential for promoting the inclusion and empowerment of individuals with cognitive disabilities, realizing this potential requires a change in societal attitudes and development practices. This paper calls for interdisciplinary collaboration and close partnership with the disability community in the development and implementation of GenAI technologies. Realizing the potential of GenAI for promoting the inclusion and empowerment of individuals with cognitive disabilities requires a multifaceted approach. This involves a shift in societal attitudes, inclusive AI development practices that prioritize the needs and perspectives of the disability community, and ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration. This paper emphasizes the importance of proceeding with caution, recognizing the ethical complexities and potential risks alongside the transformative possibilities of GenAI technology.}

abstract = {Objective
To develop and validate an artificial intelligence–powered platform that simulates surgical oral examinations, addressing the limitations of traditional faculty-led sessions.
Patients and Methods
This cross-sectional study, conducted from June 1, 2024, through December 1, 2024, comprised technical validation and educational assessment of a novel large language model (LLM)–based surgical education tool (surgery oral examination large language model [SOE-LLM]). The study involved 12 surgical clerkship students completing their core rotation at a major academic medical center. The SOE-LLM, using MIMIC-IV–derived surgical cases (acute appendicitis and pancreatitis), was implemented to simulate oral examinations. Technical validation assessed performance across 8 domains: case presentation accuracy, physical examination findings, historical detail preservation, laboratory data reporting, imaging interpretation, management decisions, and recognition of contraindicated interventions. Educational utility was evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale.
Results
Technical validation showed the SOE-LLM’s ability to function as a consistent oral examiner. The model accurately guided students through case presentations, responded to diagnostic questions, and provided clinically sound responses based on MIMIC-IV cases. When tested with standardized prompts, it maintained examination fidelity, requiring proper diagnostic reasoning and differentiating operative versus medical management. Student evaluations highlighted the platform’s value as an examination preparation tool (mean, 4.250; SEM, 0.1794) and its ability to create a low-stakes environment for high-stakes decision practice (mean, 4.833; SEM, 0.1124).
Conclusion
The SOE-LLM shows potential as a valuable tool for surgical education, offering a consistent and accessible platform for simulating oral examinations.}

Current research reveals robust defensive approaches; however, there remains a significant gap in the application of Generative AI to develop advanced attack scenarios capable of bypassing existing defense mechanisms. Our work attempts to fill this gap and spreads awareness regarding a potential exposure of Neural Network (NN)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) against AI-enhanced attacks. Unlike conventional approaches that focus on Input Perturbation, Data Poisoning, or Spoofing, we propose a novel offensive strategy called Attack Obfuscation. This strategy leverages Conditional GANs (CGANs) to conceal genuine attacks by injecting synthetic traffic designed to deceive NN-based IDS. The experimental investigation validates the proposed approach against three distinct datasets and different typologies of attacks, managing to successfully deceive the IDS.}

However, the modelling of the physical processes related to blood-integrated nanotechnology involves considerable intricacy and holds great significance. Considering these factors, we propose computational framework utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to simulate the hemodynamics of blood-mediated ternary nanofluid flow through parallel plates. Moreover, to investigate the impacts of thermal radiation and Lorentz force on fluid flow, we employed an artificial neural networks (ANNs)-integrated Bayesian regularization algorithm (BRA). The efficiency of the model is maintained by partitioning the dataset into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) subsets to mitigate over-fitting and guarantee optimum accuracy. We convert governing non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) via similarity transformation, and then applied the improved finite difference discretization known as the Keller-box method (KBM) to evaluate it. Augmenting the squeezing parameter leads to a deceleration of the velocity distribution, whereas an elevated Hartmann number enhances heat transmission. The regression assessments of 1 signify a strong alignment across the observed data and the predicted outcomes. AI was used in this study in two main ways: first, it was used to accurately predict how nanofluids would behave at high temperatures; and second, it was used to find the best way to design nanofluid-based thermal systems that have a lot of potential for use in medicine, especially when it comes to heart health.}

Traditional cancer therapies are limited by side effects and damage to healthy tissues, while modern targeted treatments face challenges such as drug resistance and restricted applicability across cancer types. Early diagnosis also remains difficult, as many methods lack the sensitivity and specificity needed to reliably detect small, early-stage tumors. This review explores hybrid nanomaterial-based delivery systems, such as lipid–gold nanoparticle composites combined with polymeric nanocarriers, to improve the precision and efficacy of gene therapy. Advances in nanotechnology are highlighted for their ability to augment gene-editing tools including RNA interference and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9), supported by techniques like optical tweezers, plasmonics, fluorescence imaging, and metamaterials. Nanophotonics in particular offers ultra-sensitive molecular imaging and real-time biomarker detection, underscoring its value for early cancer diagnosis. Artificial intelligence further strengthens these approaches by optimizing nanocarrier design, predicting therapeutic outcomes, and guiding personalized treatment strategies. Machine learning and deep learning platforms enable efficient analysis of complex genomic and clinical datasets, improving predictive accuracy and therapeutic customization. The review also outlines molecular mechanisms of gene therapy, from editing to expression, and addresses barriers to clinical translation, such as data integration, model validation, and regulatory considerations. Combining nanotechnology, artificial intelligence (AI), and gene-editing advances holds promise for more effective, targeted, and minimally invasive cancer treatments. These integrated strategies support earlier detection, enhance therapeutic precision, and provide a framework for translating experimental breakthroughs into clinical applications that better align with the goals of personalized medicine.}

The graded diagnosis of periodontitis has always been a difficulty for dentists. This systematic review aimed to investigate the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) models for periodontitis classification.
Data
This review includes original studies that explore the application of AI in periodontitis classification systems.
Sources
Two reviewers independently conducted a comprehensive search of literature published up to April 2024 in databases including PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library.
Study selection
A total of 28 articles were eventually included in this study, from which 10 mapping parameters were extracted and evaluated separately for each article.
Results
AI's diagnostic capabilities are comparable to those of a general dentist/periodontist, achieving an overall diagnostic accuracy rate of over 70 % for periodontitis classification, with some reaching 80–90 %. Variations in diagnosis accuracy rates were observed across different stages of periodontitis.
Conclusions
The AI model provides a novel and relatively reliable method for periodontitis classification. However, several key issues remain to be addressed, including access to and quality of data, interpretation of the decision-making process of the model, the ability of the model to generalize, and ethical and privacy considerations.
Clinical significance
The development of AI models for periodontitis classification is expected to assist dentists in improving diagnostic efficiency and enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and further development is expected to assist telemedicine and home self-testing.}

This study explores applying Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to demystify the contributing factors in land susceptibility prediction models using Extra Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost regression. We employ grid search tuning to compare these models and identify the one that fits our data. Additionally, we leverage Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide comprehensive insights into model behavior and decision-making processes. By applying XAI to the historical land susceptibility dataset, we identify key factors such as elevation, slope, aspect, slum areas prone areas, groundwater, topography wetness index (TWI), distance to road and rivers, land use, and soil types that have significance influence on land susceptibility predictions. Results show that topography elevation and distance to road influence land susceptibility more than other factors. This study demonstrates that integrating XAI methodology can enhance model performance and help in the effective communication of findings to policymakers and land managers. This approach not only improves the interpretability of susceptibility predictions but also fosters better-informed decision-making for anomaly detection, land use management, and disaster risk reduction, especially for areas near critical infrastructures.}

To organize the existing literature regarding applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in biopsies and imaging modalities of patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs) and to familiarize readers with the most commonly occurring concepts.
Results
Firstly, we present a workflow that summarizes techniques implemented in AI for biopsies and imaging modalities in SARDs. Next, we describe challenges specific to image analysis for medicine. Subsequently, we describe the goals for an AI study in this field, and the prerequisites to meet them in SARDs. Finally, after reviewing the existing literature, we present the applications of AI for image analysis in each SARD. Accordingly, we analyze 1–2 studies from each SARD and mention key messages and lessons derived from them. Lastly, we create a recommendation landscape identifying unmet needs for AI applications in each SARD. The vast majority of studies employ supervised learning for image classification or segmentation, and rarely for regression. The median dataset size was 116 patients for imaging studies and 271 patients for biopsies studies, while the number of images per study varied greatly. Reporting of multiple performance metrics was frequently neglected.
Conclusions
Employing AI for SARD image analysis ultimately demands large datasets with multimodal and adequately diverse data to effectively capture the heterogeneity of SARDs. In the field of rheumatology, plagued by subjectivity and interobserver variability, issues regarding data quality, regulatory authorities and the specificity and clinical impact of questions posed will define the time needed for clinical adoption of AI-assisted medical care.}

The systematic search comprised articles in the Scopus database, from 2000 to 2023. The results from 48 articles show that AI has been applied mainly to predict compressive strength and slump. Comparing the AI techniques to their R2, no clear trend was observed, i.e., there was no overall best algorithm; and their performance was not directly related to database size. Still, Random Forest obtained superior results in articles that compared multiple techniques. Some of the main gaps identified are the lack of studies with geopolymers synthesized in acidic environments or with waste-based or nanomaterials; and that AI has not been largely applied to properties besides compressive strength (e.g., fire resistance, durability, porosity, and thermal properties). Regarding transparency, authors have seldom publicized their codes, impairing proper review of the models.

abstract = {Many properties of commonly used materials are driven by their microstructure, which can be influenced by the composition and manufacturing processes. To optimise future materials, understanding the microstructure is critically important. Here, we present two novel approaches based on artificial intelligence that allow the segmentation of the phases of a microstructure for which simple numerical approaches, such as thresholding, are not applicable: One is based on the nnU-Net neural network, and the other on generative adversarial networks (GAN). Using scanning electron microscopy images collected from large areas (∼1 mm2) of dual-phase steels as a case study, we demonstrate how both methods effectively segment intricate microstructural details, including martensite, ferrite, and damage sites, for subsequent analysis. Either method shows substantial generalizability across a range of image sizes and conditions, including heat-treated microstructures with different phase configurations. The nnU-Net excels in mapping large image areas. Conversely, the GAN-based method performs reliably on smaller images, providing greater step-by-step control and flexibility over the segmentation process. This study highlights the benefits of segmented microstructural data for various purposes, such as calculating phase fractions, modelling material behaviour through finite element simulation, and conducting geometrical analyses of damage sites and the local properties of their surrounding microstructure.}

While traditional approaches struggle to keep up with the complexity of tackling coastal problems, particularly considering the growing concerns about climate change. In the face of climate change and other increasing natural and manmade concomitances, coastal areas contend with challenges like sea-level rise, sediment transport, water quality problems, coral reef degradation, and other coastal characteristics such as wind and tide. The paper delves into these complexities and how AI presented different techniques in a trial to enhance the predictive abilities that offer early warning systems, enhancing coastal resilience. This paper also shows Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms showing the different supervised and unsupervised algorithms such as Linear Regression, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Support Vector Machines (SVM) etc. It also critically examines the AI-coastal engineering integration showing its drawback such as the need of more data and its limited transferability.

abstract = {Background
Trajectory modeling is a long-standing challenge in the application of computational methods to health care. In the age of big data, traditional statistical and machine learning methods do not achieve satisfactory results as they often fail to capture the complex underlying distributions of multimodal health data and long-term dependencies throughout medical histories. Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have provided powerful tools to represent complex distributions and patterns with minimal underlying assumptions, with major impact in fields such as finance and environmental sciences, prompting researchers to apply these methods for disease modeling in health care.
Objective
While AI methods have proven powerful, their application in clinical practice remains limited due to their highly complex nature. The proliferation of AI algorithms also poses a significant challenge for nondevelopers to track and incorporate these advances into clinical research and application. In this paper, we introduce basic concepts in generative AI and discuss current algorithms and how they can be applied to health care for practitioners with little background in computer science.
Methods
We surveyed peer-reviewed papers on generative AI models with specific applications to time-series health data. Our search included single- and multimodal generative AI models that operated over structured and unstructured data, physiological waveforms, medical imaging, and multi-omics data. We introduce current generative AI methods, review their applications, and discuss their limitations and future directions in each data modality.
Results
We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines and reviewed 155 articles on generative AI applications to time-series health care data across modalities. Furthermore, we offer a systematic framework for clinicians to easily identify suitable AI methods for their data and task at hand.
Conclusions
We reviewed and critiqued existing applications of generative AI to time-series health data with the aim of bridging the gap between computational methods and clinical application. We also identified the shortcomings of existing approaches and highlighted recent advances in generative AI that represent promising directions for health care modeling.}

The report issued by the UN in 2022 highlighted that the global education crisis for vulnerable groups has worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, war, lack of infrastructure, and little or no psychosocial support. The prevalence of English as the medium of instruction in higher education, is a challenge for students who speak English as a second language. In South Africa, and Africa as a whole, the majority of the population speak in their mother tongue as a first language, which is problematic for students enrolled at English medium universities. This study focuses on accounting education from a South African perspective. Earlier research found that the number of African chartered accountants in South Africa are inadequately represented and cited one of the reasons as being a language barrier. We propose that the translation of accounting concepts into indigenous African languages can improve the understanding of accounting principles which will allow for inclusive, equitable, and quality education for all. In doing so, we develop a prototype application, which encompasses augmented reality and artificial intelligence-generated language translation functionalities to teach accounting principles in an indigenous African language, namely, IsiZulu. The application, named Zulu Augmented Reality Translation (ZART), aids the learning process of accounting principles, by providing an engaging and interactive learning experience in IsiZulu. The paper commences with a literature review on the teaching pedagogy and challenges in accounting education. Thereafter, the design science research applied in the development of ZART is discussed. Using questionnaires, an experiment is conducted to evaluate the usability of ZART, students’ perceptions and pedagogical experiences of using ZART. The results of the evaluation show that ZART was easy to install and use; students were captivated with the avatars in ZART; and the language translation functionality was useful for learning the basics of accounting. ZART is of importance to policy makers and standard setters in the accounting profession, accounting academics, and accounting students. This study provides a platform for the translation of the accounting curriculum into numerous indigenous African languages.}

However, maintaining secure and efficient data management becomes crucial as 6G networks grow in size and complexity. This study investigates blockchain clustering and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to ensure a reliable and trustworthy communication in 6G. First, the mechanisms and protocols of blockchain clustering that provide a trusted and effective communication infrastructure for 6G networks are presented. Then, AI techniques for network security in 6G are studied. The integration of AI and blockchain to ensure energy efficiency in 6G networks is addressed. Next, this paper presents how the 6G’s speed and bandwidth enables AI and the easy management of virtualized systems. Using terahertz connections is sufficient to have virtualized systems move compute environments as well as data. For instance, a computing environment can follow potential security violations while leveraging AI. Such virtual machines can store their findings in blockchains. In 6G scenarios, case studies and real-world applications of AI-powered secure blockchain clustering are given. Moreover, challenges and promising future research opportunities are highlighted.

Single-step AI-driven retrosynthesis models can be generalized into three types based on their dependence on predefined reaction templates (template-based, semitemplate-based methods, template-free models), with respective advantages and limitations, and common challenges that limit their medicinal chemistry applications. Moreover, there are relatively inadequate multi-step retrosynthesis methods, which lack strong links with single-step methods.

By critically examining published definitions, highlighting both consistencies and inconsistencies, this paper proposes a refined nomenclature that harmonizes conceptualizations across the two disciplines. Abstract and operational definitions for human and artificial intelligence are proposed that emphasize maximal capacity for completing novel goals successfully through respective perceptual-cognitive and computational processes. Additionally, support for considering intelligence, both human and artificial, as consistent with a multidimensional model of capabilities is provided. The implications of current practices in artificial intelligence training and testing are also described, as they can be expected to lead to artificial achievement or expertise rather than artificial intelligence. Paralleling psychometrics, ‘AI metrics’ is suggested as a needed computer science discipline that acknowledges the importance of test reliability and validity, as well as standardized measurement procedures in artificial system evaluations. Drawing parallels with human general intelligence, artificial general intelligence (AGI) is described as a reflection of the shared variance in artificial system performances. We conclude that current evidence more greatly supports the observation of artificial achievement and expertise over artificial intelligence. However, interdisciplinary collaborations, based on common understandings of the nature of intelligence, as well as sound measurement practices, could facilitate scientific innovations that help bridge the gap between artificial and human-like intelligence.}

The major frameworks are focused on identifying content and technical knowledge (AI literacy). Most of the current definitions of AI literacy for a non-technical audience are developed from an engineering perspective and may not be appropriate for K–12 education. Teacher perspectives are essential to making sense of this initiative. Literacy is about knowing (knowledge, what skills); competency is about applying the knowledge in a beneficial way (confidence, how well). They are strongly related. This study goes beyond knowledge (AI literacy), and its two main goals are to (i) define AI literacy and competency by adding the aspects of confidence and self-reflective mindsets, and (ii) propose a more comprehensive framework for K–12 AI education. These definitions are needed for this emerging and disruptive technology (e.g., ChatGPT and Sora, generative AI). We used the definitions and the basic curriculum design approaches as the analytical framework and teacher perspectives. Participants included 30 experienced AI teachers from 15 middle schools. We employed an iterative co-design cycle to discuss and revise the framework throughout four cycles. The definition of AI competency has five abilities that take confidence into account, and the proposed framework comprises five key components: technology, impact, ethics, collaboration, and self-reflection. We also identify five effective learning experiences to foster abilities and confidences, and suggest five future research directions: prompt engineering, data literacy, algorithmic literacy, self-reflective mindset, and empirical research.}

This paper investigates a new method called a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN)-based system state estimator, which consists of two systems: a data validation model and a fault detection model. In this research, heat graphs are used as a tool for visualizing numerical data and a method for preprocessing information in training the CNN model. On the other hand, one emerging tool in artificial intelligence is generative adversarial network (GAN), which is a deep learning method that can bypass intrusion detection systems by generating fake examples. In response, this paper uses both common examples and examples generated by GAN for training and evaluation of the presented system. The proposed method considers the role of fake data injection (FDI) in smart networks with the aim of increasing the accuracy of the proposed model and then focuses on the impact of combined FDI and denial of service (DoS) attacks on smart networks. In this paper, two complex cyber-attack scenarios are investigated. The proposed model is capable of effectively detecting both attacks, as evidenced by the simulation results for varying attack intensities, which achieved a validation accuracy of 99.51 in scenario I and 99.32, 99.59, and 99.50 in scenario II. Moreover, the results indicate that using the examples generated by GAN helps the data validation model to increase its accuracy against cyber-attacks and the fault detection model quickly identifies the desired fault and notifies the system operators.}

Artificial intelligence methods, particularly hybrid models, offer a more resilient alternative by combining different techniques, providing more accurate assessments even with limited data. Therefore, this study reviews the application of AI methods in the safety assessment of submarine pipelines, focusing on hybrid models that combine Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bayesian Network (BN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with other techniques.

Although photovoltaics (PVs) have limited efficiency, concentrating photovoltaic–thermal (CPV/T) systems generate electricity and heat simultaneously, achieving 60 to 80 % total efficiency, considerably higher than those obtained from PVs. However, the performance of CPV/T highly depends on operational parameters such as irradiance fluctuations, cell temperature, and tracking inaccuracies, limiting their use in real world applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques including deep neural networks (DNNs), reinforcement learning (RL), and hybrid algorithms solve these problems by enabling adaptive thermal regulation, fault detection, real-time optimization and precision solar tracking. This paper has reviewed recent progresses in AI, with special focus on CPV/T systems, analyzing approaches for dynamic cooling control, predictive maintenance, irradiance forecasting and system design. Experimental validations revealed that AI-driven control increased thermal stability by > 35, %decreased mirror misalignment by ≤ 85 %, and obtained R2 > 0.99 for energy prediction. However, serious limitations such as climate-specific model transferability, computational constraints in off-grid settings, interdisciplinary gaps between AI and solar engineering, and data scarcity still exist.

abstract = {Background
Social robots (SR), sensorimotor machines designed to interact with humans, can help to respond to the increasing demands in the health care sector. To ensure the successful use of this technology, acceptance is paramount. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology with the potential to enhance the functionality of SR and promote user acceptance by further improving human-robot interaction.
Objective
We present a protocol for a scoping review of the literature on the implementation of generative AI in SR in the health care sector. The aim of this scoping review is to map out the intersection of SR and generative AI in the health care sector; to explore if generative AI is applied in SR in the health care sector; to outline which models of generative AI and SR are used for these implementations; and to explore whether user acceptance is reported as an outcome following these implementations. This scoping review supports future research by providing an overview of the state of connectedness of 2 emerging technologies and by mapping out research gaps.
Methods
We follow the methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley and the recommendations by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Our protocol was drafted using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). We will conduct a systematic literature search of the online databases MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore, aiming to retrieve relevant data items via tabular data charting from references meeting specific inclusion criteria which are studies published from 2010 onwards, set in the health care sector, focusing on SR with physical bodies and implemented generative AI. There are no restrictions on study types. Results will be categorized, clustered, and summarized using tables, graphs, visual representations, and narratives.
Results
After conducting a preliminary search and deduplication in the second quarter of 2024, we retrieved 3176 preliminary results. This scoping review will be supplemented with the next methodological steps, including retrieving the results in a reference management tool as well as screening titles, abstracts, and full text regarding specific inclusion criteria. The completion of these steps is scheduled for the second quarter of 2025. Limitations based on the heterogeneity of the included studies and the general breadth of a scoping review compared to a systematic review are to be expected. To reduce bias, we adopted a system of dual reviews and thorough documentation of the study selection.
Conclusions
The conducted preliminary search implies that there are a sufficient number of heterogeneous references to complete this scoping review. To our knowledge, this is the first scoping review on generative AI in health care SR.

By extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) to include sustainable policy alignment and policy ambiguity as moderating factors, the research explores how these policy elements influence the relationship between GenAI adoption and SLBs’ discretionary actions. Data was collected from 489 SLBs and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings demonstrate that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, and habit significantly drive the continuous intention to use GenAI. In contrast, social influence and facilitating conditions do not have a significant effect. Furthermore, the continuous intention to use GenAI positively influences SLBs’ discretion in policy implementation, with sustainable policy alignment strengthening this relationship and diminishing policy ambiguity. A multi-group analysis reveals notable differences between Iraq and Oman. In Oman, all UTAUT2 variables are significant, reflecting a supportive and stable governance environment. In contrast, in Iraq, individual perceptions dominate, likely due to higher policy ambiguity and weaker institutional support. These results underscore the importance of emphasizing GenAI’s practical benefits and ease of use and advocate for developing clear, supportive policies that empower SLBs. This study extends the theoretical foundations of UTAUT2 in the public sector, offering practical insights for policymakers and organizations seeking to leverage GenAI for enhanced sustainability outcomes.}

This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the accuracy of AI algorithms in gender determination using OPGs, focusing on the reliability and potential clinical and forensic applications of these technologies. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. The study included research articles that utilised AI algorithms for gender detection based on OPG images. Five major databases were searched, and studies were selected based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The analysis focused on studies that reported accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of AI models. Statistical analyses were performed using R software, including forest plots and funnel plots, to evaluate the diagnostic performance and potential publication bias. The meta-analysis included 13 studies, yielding a pooled accuracy estimate of 88.66%. The results demonstrated high specificity among the AI models, with some studies achieving accuracy rates as high as 99.20%. However, there was variability in sensitivity across different studies, indicating that some models are more reliable than others depending on the dataset and features used. The funnel plot analysis suggested slight asymmetry, indicating potential publication bias or heterogeneity. AI models show significant potential in accurately determining gender from OPG images, with some models achieving near-perfect accuracy. Continued research is needed to enhance model consistency and expand the applicability of these tools across different demographic groups.}

abstract = {Traditional ultrasound methods, particularly cardiac echocardiography, depend predominantly on evidence-based decision trees and risk-scoring systems to guide and standardise clinical decision-making. Although these approaches demonstrate some effectiveness, their inherent rigidity and failure to address non-linear interactions lead to inadequate consideration of individual variability, thereby compromising diagnostic accuracy and consistency. Furthermore, these conventional techniques are vulnerable to human bias, which increases the risk of misdiagnosis. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI)-based analytical strategies substantially overcome these limitations using machine and deep learning methodologies. Furthermore, AI can autonomously annotate, measure, and evaluate cardiac function, significantly minimising human error, while enhancing diagnostic precision and reliability. In addition, AI can quickly process extensive volumes of imaging data and efficiently quantify cardiovascular pathological features, thereby improving the efficacy and accuracy of cardiovascular disease diagnosis. AI is widely applied in various areas of cardiac echocardiography, including image classification, disease screening, and automated measurements. Given the increasing integration of AI into cardiac echocardiography practices, we present a comprehensive review of the advantages of AI strategies and their practical applications, aiming to provide profound insights that may help promote automated intelligent analysis of echocardiography.}

abstract = {This study presents a hybrid multi-generation energy system designed to overcome solar intermittency while meeting the global demand for integrated delivery of electricity, water, cooling, and sustainable fuels in the transition to decarbonization. The engineering application integrates solar thermal and wind energy with a modified Brayton cycle, a Steam Rankine Cycle (SRC), and a Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) to simultaneously produce electricity, fresh water via Reverse Osmosis (RO), hydrogen and oxygen via Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzer (PEME), and cooling (via absorption chiller) within a unified optimization framework. The system was modeled using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) and optimized via Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on 11 decision variables. To address the complexity of optimization, a second phase applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques: Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) for predictive modelling and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for global optimization. Under optimal conditions, the Response Surface Methodology yielded an exergy efficiency of 45.8 % with a cost rate of 576.76 United States Dollars per hour (USD/h), while AI reduced costs to 211.2 USD/h with a moderate efficiency trade-off. Simulation of the optimized configuration across eight diverse climates identified Quebec as most viable, generating 22,629.6 Megawatt-hours per year (MWh/year) of electricity and avoiding 4616.4 tons of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions annually. Integration of wind energy stabilizes solar variability, enhancing performance. AI contributes to optimizing complex interactions, nonlinear constraints, and multiple conflicting objectives. The methodology offers a scalable, generalizable framework for designing intelligent, climate-resilient infrastructures. Future research includes AI-enabled real-time control, experimental validation, and broader deployment strategies.}

abstract = {Background
Chronic diseases represent a significant global burden of mortality, exacerbated by behavioral risk factors. Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed health promotion and disease reduction through improved early detection, encouraging healthy lifestyle modifications, and mitigating the economic strain on health systems.
Objective
The aim of this study is to investigate how AI contributes to health promotion and disease reduction among Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.
Methods
We conducted a rapid review of the literature to identify the latest evidence on how AI is used in health promotion and disease reduction. We applied comprehensive search strategies formulated for MEDLINE (OVID) and CINAHL to locate studies published between 2019 and 2024. A pair of reviewers independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to screen the titles and abstracts, assess the full texts, and extract the data. We synthesized extracted data from the study characteristics, intervention characteristics, and intervention purpose using structured narrative summaries of main themes, giving a portrait of the current scope of available AI initiatives used in promoting healthy activities and preventing disease.
Results
We included 22 studies in this review (out of 3442 publications screened), most of which were conducted in the United States (10/22, 45%) and focused on health promotion by targeting lifestyle dimensions, such as dietary behavior (10/22, 45%), smoking cessation (6/22, 27%), physical activity (4/22, 18%), and mental health (3/22, 14%). Three studies targeted disease reduction related to metabolic health (eg, obesity, diabetes, hypertension). Most AI initiatives were AI-powered mobile apps. Overall, positive results were reported for process outcomes (eg, acceptability, engagement), cognitive and behavioral outcomes (eg, confidence, step count), and health outcomes (eg, glycemia, blood pressure). We categorized the challenges, benefits, and suggestions identified in the studies using a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis to inform future developments. Key recommendations include conducting further investigations, taking into account the needs of end users, improving the technical aspect of the technology, and allocating resources.
Conclusions
These findings offer critical insights into the effective implementation of AI for health promotion and disease prevention, potentially guiding policymakers and health care practitioners in optimizing the use of AI technologies in supporting health promotion and disease reduction.
