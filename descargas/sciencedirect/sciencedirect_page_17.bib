abstract = {Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown promise in facilitating surgical video review through automatic recognition of surgical activities/events. There are few public video data sources that demonstrate critical yet rare events which are insufficient to train AI for reliable video event recognition. We suggest that a generative AI algorithm can create artificial massive bleeding images for minimally invasive lobectomy that can be used to augment the current lack of data in this field.
Materials and methods
A generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithm was used (CycleGAN) to generate artificial massive bleeding event images. To train CycleGAN, six videos of minimally invasive lobectomies were utilized from which 1819 frames of nonbleeding instances and 3178 frames of massive bleeding instances were used.
Results
The performance of the CycleGAN algorithm was tested on a new video that was not used during the training process. The trained CycleGAN was able to alter the laparoscopic lobectomy images according to their corresponding massive bleeding images, where the contents of the original images were preserved (e.g., location of tools in the scene) and the style of each image is changed to massive bleeding (i.e., blood automatically added to appropriate locations on the images).
Conclusions
The result could suggest a promising approach to supplement the lack of data for the rare massive bleeding event that can occur during minimally invasive lobectomy. Future work could be dedicated to developing AI algorithms to identify surgical strategies and actions that potentially lead to massive bleeding and warn surgeons prior to this event occurrence.}

Despite the adoption of telemedicine and AI-driven healthcare solutions, disabled and elderly people continue to face challenges in accessing real-time medical services, receiving accurate diagnoses and independently navigate healthcare facilities. Current healthcare systems often struggle with delays, lack of personalization, and inefficiencies in medical data processing, limiting their effectiveness in providing inclusive and responsive healthcare. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an AI-powered healthcare framework that integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and the Analytic Network Process (ANP). RLHF enables AI models to learn and adapt based on real-time user feedback, ensuring a personalized and interactive healthcare experience. Meanwhile, ANP optimizes decision-making processes, allowing for faster, more accurate medical service delivery by considering multiple healthcare factors. This combined approach improves remote consultations, intelligent diagnostics, and seamless real-time interactions, significantly improving accessibility to healthcare for disabled individuals. The proposed framework is evaluated against existing AI-driven healthcare models. Results demonstrate that the system outperforms traditional methods, providing a faster, more reliable, and patient-centered healthcare experience. By combining GAI, RLHF, and ANP, this research offers a practical solution to improve healthcare accessibility for disabled individuals, aligning with the goals of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030.}

Traditional materials engineering education has often relied on a transmission teaching approach, in which students are expected to passively receive information from instructors. However, this approach has shown to be inadequate under the current circumstances, in which information is readily available and innovative tools such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality environments are becoming widespread (e.g., metaverse). Instead, we consider that a critical goal of education should be to develop aptitudes and abilities that enable students to generate solutions and products that address societal demands. In this work, we propose innovative strategies, such as product-based learning methods and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) artificial intelligence text generation models, to modify the focus of a Materials in Chemical Engineering course from non-sustainable materials to sustainable ones, aiming to address the critical challenges of our society. This approach aims to achieve two objectives: first to enable students to actively engage with raw materials and solve real-world challenges, and second, to foster creativity and entrepreneurship skills by providing them with the necessary tools to conduct brainstorming sessions and develop procedures following scientific methods. The incorporation of circular bioeconomy concepts, such as renewable resources, waste reduction, and resource efficiency into the curriculum provides a framework for students to understand the environmental, social, and economic implications in Chemical Engineering. It also allows them to make informed decisions within the circular bioeconomy framework, benefiting society by promoting the development and adoption of sustainable technologies and practices.}

abstract = {Background & aims
Mitochondrial (mt-) D-loop and cell-free circulating (ccf-) mtDNA fragments, respectively reflecting mt-mass and tissue damage, are promising metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) biomarkers. We previously found that PNPLA3/MBOAT7/TM6SF2 deficiency in HepG2 cells increased mt-mass, D-loop levels, and ccf-COXIII release. We explored mt-biogenesis and mt-biomarkers in patients with MASLD stratified by the number of risk variants (NRV = 3). We exploited GPT-4 to develop and validate new risk scores, predicting MASLD evolution, in two independent cohorts by integrating anthropometric and genetic data with mt-biomarkers.
Methods
A cohort of 28 patients with MASLD (Discovery cohort) was consecutively enrolled for hepatic mt-dynamics assessment by transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Data were confirmed by quantitative real time-PCR in a retrospective cohort (Hepatic Validation, n = 184). D-loop and ccf-COXIII were retrospectively measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum samples of biopsied outpatients with MASLD (Serum Validation cohort, n = 824) and individuals with non-invasive MASLD diagnosis (n = 386, Non-invasive cohort). Risk scores were developed using random forest algorithms.
Results
In the Discovery and Hepatic Validation cohorts, the PNPLA3/MBOAT7/TM6SF2 variants altered hepatic mt-dynamics, enhancing mt-content and D-loop levels (p <0.05) through the p38/PGC-1α pathway. Furthermore, NRV = 3 patients showed an increase in mt-fragmentation at transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and ccf-COXIII release (p <0.05). In the Serum Validation cohort, circulating D-loop and ccf-COXIII positively correlated with genetics [βD-loop:0.17 (95% CI: 0.04–0.29), p = 0.01; βccf-COXIII:0.33 (95% CI: 0.19–0.46), p <0.0001] and MASLD severity [ORD-loop:1.31 (95% CI: 1.01-1.71), p = 0.03; ORccf-COXIII:2.41 (95% CI: 1.69-3.44), p <0.0001] at multivariate analysis. Random forest allowed prediction models named Mitochondrial, Anthropometric, and Genetic Integration with Computational intelligence for assessing hepatocellular carcinoma risk (MAGIC-H), considering age, BMI genetics, D-loop, and ccf-COXIII. In both Serum and Non-invasive cohorts, the MAGIC-H score reached AUC >85% in identifying HCC cases regardless of cirrhosis, outperforming existing non-invasive tests.
Conclusions
Mt-biomarkers have a prognostic significance in genetically-predisposed patients with MASLD.
Impact and implications
The study highlights that genetic variants in PNPLA3, MBOAT7, and TM6SF2 genes deeply contribute to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) progression by affecting hepatic mitochondrial adaptability. It also identified two novel biomarkers of mitochondrial origin which are strongly linked to disease severity and genetic background of patients with MASLD. The use of generative artificial intelligence tools, such as GPT-4, can enhance the use of biomarkers and polygenic risk scores for clinical risk stratification. We developed a customized version of GPT-4 (rsGPT-4), which identified a machine-learning approach (random forest) as the best method for creating prediction models for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The new scores combined the two mitochondrial biomarkers, genetic data, and anthropometric data and outperformed existing non-invasive tests for monitoring patients with MASLD.}

A comprehensive AI adoption index is constructed using novel text-mining and machine-learning techniques applied to annual reports of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2007 through 2023. The analysis reveals that AI intensity boosts productivity and operational competitiveness, which in turn prompts firm expansion and increases overall labor demand. Yet aggregate growth masks a pronounced shift toward high-skill occupations, producing a skill-biased unipolarization of labor demand. Input–output analysis further shows that AI penetration in upstream industries exacerbates this polarization in downstream sectors. Policy evaluation indicates that government interventions, especially in technology-intensive firms, dampen the labor-market disruptions associated with AI, with the strongest stabilizing effects observed in regions featuring rigorous tax enforcement and low market segmentation. Threshold-effect tests uncover a nonlinear pattern of rising marginal impacts of AI on labor demand. The employment-enhancing benefits of AI are most evident in state-owned enterprises, large firms, and capital-and-technology-intensive industries. These findings offer fresh microeconomic insights into the employment consequences of AI and provide guidance for labor market governance, industrial upgrading, and human capital development in the digital era.}

Large language models (LLM), like ChatGPT, are considered a novel solution for delivering online psychological counseling. However, performance evaluation, emotional expression, high levels of anthropomorphism, ethical issues, transparency, and privacy breaches need to be addressed before LLM can be widely adopted. This study aimed to evaluate ChatGPT’s effectiveness and emotional support capabilities in providing mental health counseling services from both macro and micro perspectives to examine whether it possesses psychological support abilities comparable to those of human experts. Building on the macro-level evaluation, we conducted a deeper comparison of the linguistic differences between ChatGPT and human experts at the micro-level. In addition, to respond to current policy requirements regarding the labeling, we further explored how to identify artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) in counseling texts and which micro-level linguistic features can effectively distinguish AIGC from user-generated content (UGC). Finally, the study addressed transparency, privacy breaches, and ethical concerns. We utilized ChatGPT for psychological interventions, applying LLM to address various mental health issues. The BERTopic algorithm evaluated the content across multiple mental health problems. Deep learning techniques were employed to differentiate between AIGC and UGC in psychological counseling responses. Furthermore, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) evaluate interpretability, providing deeper insights into the decision-making process and enhancing transparency. At the macro level, ChatGPT demonstrated performance comparable to human experts, exhibiting professionalism, diversity, empathy, and a high degree of human likeness, making it highly effective in counseling services. At the micro level, deep learning models achieved accuracy rates of 99.12 % and 96.13 % in distinguishing content generated by ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4.0 from UGC, respectively. Interpretability analysis revealed that context, sentence structure, and emotional expression were key factors differentiating AIGC from UGC. The findings highlight ChatGPT's potential to deliver effective online psychological counseling and demonstrate a reliable framework for distinguishing between artificial intelligence-generated and human-generated content. This study underscores the importance of leveraging large-scale language models to support mental health services while addressing high-level anthropomorphic issues and ethical and practical challenges.}

This review evaluates the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in advancing predictive biomarkers through the integration of radiomics, pathomics, and multi-omics. We conducted a narrative literature review (PubMed; Web of Science; chictr.org.cn; clinicaltrials.gov, 2012–2025) using keywords spanning NSCLC, immunotherapy, and AI methodologies (radiomics, pathomics, and multi-omics). The inclusion criterion was studies that developed predictive models for immune checkpoint inhibitor outcomes; the exclusion criteria were non-original research and preclinical studies. Emerging evidence highlights AI’s transformative role in the prediction of immunotherapy efficacy for treating NSCLC: radiomics quantifies tumor heterogeneity through computed tomography-based PD-L1 and TMB ≥10 mut/Mb biomarkers, while pathomics refines PD-L1 scoring and immune microenvironment classification. Multi-omics integration synergizes imaging, histopathology, and liquid biopsy data with dynamic models by resolving spatial discordance and temporal clonal evolution. However, clinical adoption requires the standardization of peri-tumoral radiomics, validation of delta-feature protocols, and prospective trials to address overfitting risks in small cohorts. AI-driven multi-omics redefines immunotherapy prognostication, but faces interpretability and ethical challenges. Future validation must prioritize prospective multicenter trials, causal biological linking of radiomic features, and federated learning frameworks to ensure equitable clinical implementation.}

abstract = {This study focuses on understanding air pollution dynamics through the integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and spatio-temporal geostatistics for air pollution control. It combines the classic approach with the simultaneous evaluation of multiple machine learning (ML) models to enhance the interpretability of model decisions. Data from a dense network of 52 IoT (internet of things) sensors deployed across an urban municipality and surrounding areas were analyzed to identify key predictors of air pollution trends. XAI is employed to interpret complex relationships between pollution levels, meteorological conditions, human activity patterns, and geographic factors. Spatio-temporal geostatistics serve as the foundation for interpreting XAI in both spatial and temporal contexts. July exhibited the least spatial variability in PM2.5 concentrations, with the hour of the day being the key predictor (13.04% of predictive importance), while December showed the highest spatial variability, with atmospheric pressure as the dominant factor (13.84% of predictive importance). Precipitation was the least influential predictor in both months (3.00 %). Four and nine distinct clusters with significant spatial variability in predictor importance were identified. Analysis of transition matrices revealed both stable and dynamic clusters, highlighting the complex nature of PM2.5 emissions as they vary between warm and cold seasons, characteristic of moderate climate zones. This methodology enhances the understanding of air pollution dynamics and provides a transparent framework for urban pollution control and management decision-making. The findings contribute to the development of smart urban management strategies, supporting sustainable city planning and pollution mitigation efforts, while advocating for the right of citizens to a cleaner environment.}

Furthermore, the methodology section critically reflects on the limitations of the keyword-based search strategy and suggests future directions to mitigate potential literature gaps. While many studies demonstrate efficiency gains in early design phases, the integration of these technologies across the full building lifecycle remains limited. Key challenges include insufficient interoperability between platforms, lack of standardisation, and minimal adoption of GD-BIM combinations in construction and logistics. Furthermore, few studies address the regulatory compliance and real-world scalability of AI-assisted generative models.

The models are trained using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and vision transformers to classify and annotate repeats within the human genome.
Results
GenRepAI is designed to comprehensively profile repeats that underlie various neurological diseases, allowing researchers to identify pathogenic expansions. The framework will integrate into existing genomic analysis pipelines, with the capability to screen patient genomes and highlight potential causal variants for further validation.
Conclusion
GenRepAI is set to become a foundational tool in genomics, leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance the characterization of repetitive sequences. It promises significant advancements in the molecular diagnosis of repeat expansion disorders and contributes to a deeper understanding of genomic structure and function, with broad applications in personalized medicine.}

Es importante subrayar que la IA no debe ser vista como una herramienta de sustitución, sino como una ayuda para los profesionales de la AP. Aunque la IA es capaz de procesar grandes volúmenes de datos y generar predicciones precisas, no puede reemplazar la destreza y la experiencia de los profesionales en la toma de decisiones clínicas. La IA todavía requiere la interpretación y el juicio clínico de un profesional de la salud capacitado, y no puede ofrecer la empatía y el apoyo emocional que a menudo se requiere en el ámbito sanitario.}

abstract = {Background
Online information is a useful resource for patients seeking advice on their orthopaedic care. While traditional websites provide responses to specific frequently asked questions (FAQs), sophisticated artificial intelligence tools may be able to provide the same information to patients in a more accessible manner. Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a powerful artificial intelligence chatbot that has been shown to effectively draw on its large reserves of information in a conversational context with a user. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy and reliability of ChatGPT-generated responses to FAQs regarding total knee arthroplasty.
Methods
We distributed a survey that challenged arthroplasty surgeons to identify which of the 2 responses to FAQs on our institution’s website was human-written and which was generated by ChatGPT. All questions were total knee arthroplasty–related. The second portion of the survey investigated the potential to further leverage ChatGPT to assist with translation and accessibility as a means to better meet the needs of our diverse patient population.
Results
Surgeons correctly identified the ChatGPT-generated responses 4 out of 10 times on average (range: 0 to 7). No consensus was reached on any of the responses to the FAQs. Additionally, over 90% of our surgeons strongly encouraged the use of ChatGPT to more effectively accommodate the diverse patient populations that seek information from our hospital’s online resources.
Conclusions
ChatGPT provided accurate, reliable answers to our website’s FAQs. Surgeons also agreed that ChatGPT’s ability to provide targeted, language-specific responses to FAQs would be of benefit to our diverse patient population.}

To understand current use of artificial intelligence (AI), perceptions of AI, and areas of preferred future AI development for disabled adults.
Design
Data collection of disabled adults on their current use of AI, perceptions of AI, and areas of preferred future AI development. Data sampling was through the Accessibility User Research Collective, a nationally representative panel of 1532 disabled adults across the United States.
Setting
Study respondents completed an online self-administered survey in February of 2024.
Participants
Disabled adults (N=335) from the Accessibility User Research Collective.
Interventions
None.
Main Outcome Measures
Disabled adults’ use and perceptions of AI in a series of contexts including current use, barriers and facilitators to use, trust of AI, and ideal future development areas of AI.
Results
Use of AI: Adults with disabilities use AI for communication in multiple ways, with the most used being personal virtual assistants (80.90%), followed by customer service chatbots (61.79%), and conversational generative AI (57.01%). Adults with disabilities often use AI for creativity and enhancement, with over half of disabled adults using AI via search engines (83.28%), text editing (72.24%), predictive text (69.25%), consumer recommendations (66.57%), and social media feeds (54.03%). Improve Lives: A vast majority (87.4%) of people with disabilities agreed that AI has the potential to improve the lives of people with disabilities. Trust of AI: People with disabilities have a generally neutral position on trust in relation to AI (47.7%); however, of those that trust AI (25.2%) and of those that do not trust AI (27.0%), there was a slightly higher percentage of 1.8% that distrust AI. People who trust AI note that accessibility and company reputation are key drivers of their trust, more so than people who distrust AI. People who distrust AI are more commonly driven by concerns for data privacy, news and media reports, transparency of AI decision making, and other factors than people who trust AI. The accuracy of AI and previous experiences with AI do not have a different prevalence for those who do and do not trust AI. Future AI Development Interest: 96.36% of disabled adults have an interest in future AI development, with deep interest in development for communication (71.82%), household chores and general maintenance (62.42%), health and wellness (62.12%), and hobbies/leisure activities (60.61%).
Conclusions
Disabled adults use AI regularly and think AI is beneficial, and future developments should focus on communication, household needs, health, and hobbies.
Disclosures
none.}

There are also substantial individual differences in LLM capacities. Given the consistent observation of a positive manifold and general intelligence factor in human samples, along with group-level factors (e.g., crystallised intelligence), we hypothesized that LLM test scores may also exhibit positive inter-correlations, which could potentially give rise to an artificial general ability (AGA) factor and one or more group-level factors. Based on a sample of 591 LLMs and scores from 12 tests aligned with fluid reasoning (Gf), domain-specific knowledge (Gkn), reading/writing (Grw), and quantitative knowledge (Gq), we found strong empirical evidence for a positive manifold and a general factor of ability. Additionally, we identified a combined Gkn/Grw group-level factor. Finally, the number of LLM parameters correlated positively with both general factor of ability and Gkn/Grw factor scores, although the effects showed diminishing returns. We interpreted our results to suggest that LLMs, like human cognitive abilities, may share a common underlying efficiency in processing information and solving problems, though whether LLMs manifest primarily achievement/expertise rather than intelligence remains to be determined. Finally, while models with greater numbers of parameters exhibit greater general cognitive-like abilities, akin to the connection between greater neuronal density and human general intelligence, other characteristics must also be involved.}

abstract = {Household mites, recognized as a principal allergen, can induce allergic rhinitis in over 90 % of patients worldwide. It is indispensable to accurately assess mite pollutant exposure within living environments to heighten awareness regarding mite prevention. Current techniques for household mite detection and quantification, however, suffer from limitations such as complex sampling requirements, time-consuming analysis processes, and high costs, which ultimately contribute to a lack of awareness among residents. Therefore, this study develops an innovative artificial intelligence (AI) technique with multi-feature fusion for household mite detection and classification to evaluate indoor mite infestation levels. This system incorporates a symmetric Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and multiple Image Signal Processing (ISP) models to not only enhance the visual quality of images obtained from scanned Dust Mite Traps but also facilitate data augmentation, thus significantly improving the detection, classification, and quantification accuracy of two prevalent household mite species: dust mite and Cheyletid mite. With the enhanced You Only Look Once (YOLO) model, the integrated AI framework demonstrates rapid and precise mite detection and quantification, achieving an accuracy rate of 85.4 % and a counting error of only 7.1 %. Furthermore, the visualization process improves human visual interpretation, effectively raising awareness about dust mite contamination for indoor environment quality. The proposed AI models offer a cost-effective, efficient tool for assessing mite infestation within homes and increase awareness about mite protection, thereby reducing the risks of exposure to indoor allergens.}

Structural engineering, a subdiscipline of civil engineering, requires the evaluation of the suitability of different structural components before final construction phase and during recycling processes. Traditionally, this evaluation relies on laboratory experiments and highly complex numerical simulations, which are often impractical due to space and time constraints, equipment complexity, and high costs. To address these challenges, researchers worldwide have developed AI-based solutions for applications such as structural damage detection and the prediction of failure loads and patterns. These solutions offer predictive accuracy comparable to that of experimental and numerical analyses. This review presents a detailed analysis of around 100 AI-integrated studies in structural engineering conducted between 2020 and 2024, with a focus on concrete, steel, and composite structures, particularly building frames. The study summarizes the performance benchmarking of commonly used AI algorithms, such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, tree-based algorithms, and boosting methods, reporting accuracy scores above 0.80 (out of 1.00), and highlights average accuracy values of 0.90 for optimized and hybrid AI approaches. Additionally, the review explores emerging AI applications, including retrofitting technologies, buckling-restrained braces, dampers, column-beam connections, and life-cycle assessment.

However, little research has systematically examined how AI literacy (AIL) shapes university students’ creative personal identity (CPI). To address this gap, this study developed a moderated mediation model grounded in identity theory and social cognitive theory, positioning AIL as the predictor, creative self-efficacy (CSE) as the mediator, and creative mindset as the moderator. Using a cross-sectional design, the study employed structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis. The results show that AIL significantly and positively predicts CPI, with CSE partially mediating this relationship. Moreover, fixed and growth mindsets exerted distinct moderating effects across the model's pathways. Multi-group analysis further revealed that among students with more than two years of exposure to generative AI, the impact of AIL on CPI was stronger, whereas the influence of CSE on CPI was weaker. From both cognitive and psychological perspectives, this study clarifies the mechanisms through which AIL shapes students’ creative identity and highlights how differences in AI usage experience alter these pathways. The findings provide a theoretical foundation for understanding creative identity construction in the digital era and offer actionable insights for designing curricula and teaching practices that foster creativity in university education.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Objectives
Carbohydrate counting is a recommended approach for achieving glycemic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). This study aimed to compare the accuracy of carbohydrate content estimations for traditional Turkish fast foods made by artificial intelligence (AI) models and dietitian.
Methods
Children and adolescents with T1D were pretested to identify the 12 most preferred Turkish fast-food items. Standardized recipes were developed for these meals, and the meals were photographed under standardized angular and lighting conditions. The photos were then uploaded to AI applications (ChatGPT-4.0, DeepSeek, Gemini, and CarbManager) and each model was prompted to estimate the carbohydrate content of the respective food items. Dietitians were asked to estimate the carbohydrate content based on these photographs.
Results
Of the dietitians in the study (n = 40), 50% had postgraduate education, and 17.5% of those providing carbohydrate counting education (n = 20, 50.0%) had been doing so for more than 7 y. No significant difference was found between the carbohydrate estimates of dietitians who provided and those who did not provide carbohydrate counting training (P > 0.05). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the AI models was 0.3554 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0974–0.6801), indicating low reliability. The highest agreement with the estimates of dietitians who provided carbohydrate counting training (ICC = 0.417, 95% CI: 0.247–0.685) and those who did not (ICC = 0.307, 95% CI: 0.163–0.578) was observed with ChatGPT.
Conclusions
AI models can assist individuals with diabetes and healthcare professionals in estimating the carbohydrate content of foods, and consequently, can make a significant contribution to diabetes self-management.}

To develop and validate an artificial intelligence–powered platform that simulates surgical oral examinations, addressing the limitations of traditional faculty-led sessions.
Patients and Methods
This cross-sectional study, conducted from June 1, 2024, through December 1, 2024, comprised technical validation and educational assessment of a novel large language model (LLM)–based surgical education tool (surgery oral examination large language model [SOE-LLM]). The study involved 12 surgical clerkship students completing their core rotation at a major academic medical center. The SOE-LLM, using MIMIC-IV–derived surgical cases (acute appendicitis and pancreatitis), was implemented to simulate oral examinations. Technical validation assessed performance across 8 domains: case presentation accuracy, physical examination findings, historical detail preservation, laboratory data reporting, imaging interpretation, management decisions, and recognition of contraindicated interventions. Educational utility was evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale.
Results
Technical validation showed the SOE-LLM’s ability to function as a consistent oral examiner. The model accurately guided students through case presentations, responded to diagnostic questions, and provided clinically sound responses based on MIMIC-IV cases. When tested with standardized prompts, it maintained examination fidelity, requiring proper diagnostic reasoning and differentiating operative versus medical management. Student evaluations highlighted the platform’s value as an examination preparation tool (mean, 4.250; SEM, 0.1794) and its ability to create a low-stakes environment for high-stakes decision practice (mean, 4.833; SEM, 0.1124).
Conclusion
The SOE-LLM shows potential as a valuable tool for surgical education, offering a consistent and accessible platform for simulating oral examinations.}

This task is challenging because tailed classes suffer from severe data scarcity while requiring a comprehensive understanding of domain-specific medical information. To this end, we propose a Generative Class feature Fusion with Agent attention (GCFA) model, which leverages LLM-driven data generation and information fusion to enhance feature representations and mitigate data imbalance. Specifically, a generative head-tailed fusion strategy is proposed, which generates tailed samples by strategically fusing semantically diverse features from both head and tailed distributions. This ensures that generated samples retain tail-class identity while enriching their semantic diversity. Then, we design a prompt-based medical terminology learning method, where LLMs can mine critical, especially some low-frequency medical terms, from three public datasets to construct a medical vocabulary dictionary. This dictionary guides our Medical Agent Attention Mechanism, enabling targeted emphasis on important medical terms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCFA achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated datasets. Our code is available: https://github.com/WQYwqy123456/GCFA-123#.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in healthcare, with potential applications in nutritional management to improve early detection, risk stratification, and personalized interventions. This systematic review evaluated the role of AI in identifying and managing malnutrition in cancer patients, focusing on its effectiveness in nutritional status assessment, prediction, clinical outcomes, and body composition monitoring. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Excerpta Medica Database from June to July 2024, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Quantitative primary studies investigating AI-based interventions for malnutrition detection, body composition analysis, and nutritional optimization in oncology were included. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools, and evidence certainty was evaluated with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine framework. Eleven studies (n = 52,228 patients) met the inclusion criteria and were categorized into 3 overarching domains: nutritional status assessment and prediction, clinical and functional outcomes, and body composition and cachexia monitoring. AI-based models demonstrated high predictive accuracy in malnutrition detection (area under the curve >0.80). Machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, outperformed conventional screening tools. Deep learning models applied to medical imaging achieved high segmentation accuracy (Dice similarity coefficient: 0.92–0.94), enabling early cachexia detection. AI-driven virtual dietitian systems improved dietary adherence (84%) and reduced unplanned hospitalizations. AI-enhanced workflows streamlined dietitian referrals, reducing referral times by 2.4 d. AI demonstrates significant potential in optimizing malnutrition screening, body composition monitoring, and personalized nutritional interventions for cancer patients. Its integration into oncology nutrition care could enhance patient outcomes and optimize healthcare resource allocation. Further research is necessary to standardize AI models and ensure clinical applicability.

abstract = {In the quest for sustainable energy solutions, photocatalysts for hydrogen production have emerged as front-runner innovations that offer a promising route to clean and renewable energy. This review article brings the recent advances in the field of photocatalysts for hydrogen (H₂) production up to date concerning the criteria for choosing photocatalysts and the modifications that can be made on a photocatalyst to adjust its photocatalytic activity. The production of hydrogen is being brought forward as an upcoming clean energy source, and semiconductor materials are revealed to have an essential function in this field of application. Different approaches for enhancing the photocatalytic activities of semiconductor materials, including mechanisms and thermodynamic aspects, are addressed in this paper. There is a discourse on using reinforcement learning algorithms in photocatalysis and dynamic optimization of reaction conditions towards colossal efficiency and flexibility in sustainable environmental processes. The majority of semiconductor photocatalysts employed in this study include titanium oxide, g-C₃N₄, graphene, sulfides, oxides, nitrides, oxysulfides, and oxynitrides; cocatalyst-based materials seek to enhance their photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation. This article describes improved compatibility between metals and non-metals during the construction of heterojunctions, such as type I–III structures; the sophisticated systems referred to as Z-scheme and S-scheme structures; and the function of mediators in the indirect construction of a Z-scheme assembly through suitably aligned bands, which improves the photocatalytic activity. In addition, it demonstrates the most critical parameters for maximizing photocatalytic efficiency, such as reaction chemistry, mass transfer, reaction kinetics, limits to light diffusion, and selecting proper light sources and photoreceptors. Finally, this review ends with an overview of how these developments, combined with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, complete highly efficient and sustainable hydrogen production technologies, offering a road map for additional research and development in this field.}

This study develops a typology of GenAI-supported work grounded in individual ambidexterity (IA), which highlights employees’ capacity to balance exploration and exploitation while navigating competing demands. Through a thorough review of the literature and empirical examples, we identify four GenAI-enabled work types: Design and Innovation, Data Analysis and Insight Evocation, Customer Service and Engagement, and Content Generation and Optimization. These types reflect the interplay of two critical IA tensions – specialization (generalist vs. specialist) and task routinization (routine vs. non-routine), offering insights into how employees can adapt their skills and roles. Our findings provide actionable recommendations for workforce development, including designing targeted skill-building programs, implementing ethical guidelines, and fostering empowering organizational environments. Additionally, we address the psychological and procedural challenges of integrating GenAI into workplaces and propose strategies to align workforce transformation with policy objectives. By bridging theoretical insights with practical recommendations, this study offers managers a structured roadmap for fostering an ambidextrous and resilient workforce in the age of GenAI.}

Drugs that interact with multiple therapeutic targets are potential high-value products in polypharmacology-based drug discovery, but the rational design remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods to design the chemical structures of compounds that interact with multiple therapeutic target proteins. The molecular structure generation is performed by a fragment-based approach using a genetic algorithm with chemical substructures and a deep learning approach using reinforcement learning with stochastic policy gradients in the framework of generative adversarial networks. Using the proposed methods, we designed the chemical structures of compounds that would interact with two therapeutic targets of bronchial asthma, i.e., adenosine A2a receptor (ADORA2A) and phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D). We then synthesized 10 compounds and evaluated their bioactivities via the binding assays of 39 target human proteins, including ADORA2A and PDE4D. Three of the 10 synthesized compounds successfully interacted with ADORA2A and PDE4D with high specificity.}

Despite the variety of documented techniques and applications, process engineering still has much untapped potential. This chapter aims to summarize the state of AI today and how it is being used in process engineering. A more comprehensive methodology is used to characterize and categorize current applications. Present-day methods, AI varieties, and pre and subsequent processing will all be analyzed similarly and classified according to the previously addressed applications. Reverse engineering techniques and hybrid modeling will be emphasized because of the significance of mechanistic models in process engineering compared to the purely black-box nature of the majority of AI. A comprehensive plan will also be developed for using AI in process engineering at its current level. These models can help develop new models for task-specific two-phase activities. To effectively curate massive data streams into valuable information and find crucial data characteristics to solve phase change heat transfer, data scientists can assist in developing and optimizing data infrastructures. Additional computations were performed to more precisely depict the effect of the absolute pressure and, hence, the level of pressure drop on the heat and mass transfer in the adsorption bed. The created models make it possible to examine how input parameters affect outputs and optimize the bed’s working strategy. The maximum water vapor uptake and convective heat transfer coefficient for the input parameters under consideration are 1.65g/g and 1,212.62W/m2 K, respectively.}

abstract = {Purpose
The research paper’s purpose is to contribute to the literature by analysing the essential resources and processes required for successful commercialisation, the contemporary challenges and opportunities of artificial intelligence initiatives in Türkiye, and the diverse models and methods employed by these initiatives.
Design/methodology/approach
Within the scope of the research, interviews were conducted with 10 entrepreneurs who established artificial intelligence-oriented enterprises in technoparks in Istanbul and Antalya. All 10 interviews were analysed using the MAXQDA20 software tool. Structured qualitative content analysis was used for the data analysis procedure.
Findings
Based on the research, external factors have a significant impact on the future growth opportunities of the market. Expanding the client base, gaining international recognition, and securing financing are crucial for success. However, the findings reveal challenges in the relatively young local ecosystem. One major criticism is the lack of support in marketing and sales activities for refined products. To address this, providing financial incentives and knowledge transfer to those in need is vital.
Research limitations/implications
Since the research was conducted only with entrepreneurs who established and successfully commercialised artificial intelligence-oriented enterprises, it is recommended that future studies be performed with a widespread sample group, considering this limited situation. Furthermore, to overcome survivorship bias, it is recommended that posterior studies include failed commercialisation attempts in AI ventures.
Practical implications
It can be argued that there is no deliberate approach or model for commercialization. Entrepreneurs often draw from their own prior experiences or observe industry trends. Given the limited financial resources available in the domestic market and the challenge of attracting foreign investors to Turkish brands, entrepreneurs tend to rely on internal approaches for commercialisation.
Originality/value
This research delves into the commercialisation prospects and obstacles encountered by AI start-ups in Türkiye. It comprises qualitative insights into business models, commercialisation approaches, opportunities, and challenges. The data were obtained from interviews with entrepreneurs operating in the industry.}

This paper examines an artificial intelligence tutor like ChatGPT, enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation, in a pilot project at two universities. The advantage of retrieval-augmented generation in higher education is that lecturers can take control of the underlying literature used by the large language model. Four courses from three programs with different learning objectives and pedagogical methods were involved to provide as diverse a context as possible. We created an artificial intelligence tutor for each course, capable of answering students' questions by referring to the educational resources provided. Both students and lecturers reported positive experiences. Qualitative analysis of the chats shows a high level of engagement and motivation. Based on expert coding of a random sample, 1.5 % of answers were incorrect and 16.5 % were outside the context provided to the large language model. We found that retrieval-augmented generation reduces hallucinations for topics that are sufficiently explained in the material. Both the online survey results and the temporal pattern of the queries showed various learning strategies. Students used the tutor effectively, intuitively finding the most appropriate use for themselves. A comparison of different courses shows that the same tool can work differently in different contexts. Our results show that the artificial intelligence tutor does not simply impart knowledge, but mediates the relationship between student, lecturer, and course material. This mediation can facilitate learning, but it can also pose new challenges.}

This review systematically classifies key pathways—including forest, soil and ocean sinks for nature-based solutions and CCUS, enhanced weathering, mineral carbonation and DAC for engineered solutions—while identifying the complex characteristics of carbon systems such as nonlinearity and multi-source heterogeneity. To address these issues, we propose a structured “task-data-algorithm” mapping framework that supports model selection and benchmarking across use cases. Our comparative analysis of RF, SVM, CNN and RNN models reveals specific strengths: for example, CNNs show high performance in remote-sensing-based carbon mapping, while RFs offer stability in SOC prediction tasks. We further synthesize the modeling differences between nature-based and engineered systems, showing how AI facilitates high-resolution prediction, feedback integration and system optimization. The proposed framework not only bridges algorithm selection with carbon application domains but also provides a strategic reference for improving model generalization and interpretability. This study contributes a systematic foundation for the development of intelligent, AI-enabled carbon sequestration systems and supports future policy and deployment of low-carbon strategies.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in scientific research, playing an increasingly significant role in data analysis and interpretation. This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of AI-driven interpretations of health-related data in comparison to those provided by human experts.
Methods
The analysis utilized a paid version of Chat GPT-4 (AI) to interpret study results, relying solely on table titles and data extracted from the authors' previously published manuscript. The dataset encompassed body composition and health parameters within the context of a dietary intervention. Data from a prior publication by the authors were referenced, as detailed in the methods section. The evaluation focused on comparing word count and descriptive content across interpretations of three tables from the original manuscript.
Results
The human expert's data interpretation was succinct, comprising 160 words, while AI-generated descriptions extended to 426 words. Similarly, the AI provided a more verbose analysis of the pre/post-intervention parameter significance, with 374 words compared to the human's 108 words. Group interactions were described in 44 words by the human expert and 486 words by the AI. Notably, the AI's analysis was accurate, though more detailed.
Conclusions
Chat GPT-4 necessitates precise table titles and well-defined data inputs to generate comprehensive analyses, as it does not autonomously account for all parameters within the dataset. While the AI demonstrated factual accuracy and valid conclusions, its descriptions lacked precision, underscoring the importance of human oversight in ensuring interpretative clarity and relevance.}

abstract = {Objectives
To compare the morphological characteristics of full crowns designed by an experienced dental technician and a data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) system, with particular attention to their similarity to natural teeth.
Methods
Twelve digital casts, including mandibular right second premolars, were collected, three-dimensional (3D) printed, and prepared by an experienced dentist. For each case, two crowns were independently designed by an experienced dental technician (ET) and the AI system. Morphological characteristics, including buccal and lingual cusp angle, buccal-lingual diameter, mesial-distal diameter, functional cusp wear facets, 3D similarity, and occlusal contact point counts, were compared among natural teeth, ET crowns, and AI crowns. Functional cusp wear and occlusal contacts were evaluated qualitatively, based on morphological observation and visual analysis under virtual articulating paper conditions. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by least significant difference (LSD) post-hoc testing, with the significance level set at α = 0.05.
Results
Both AI crowns (56.2° ± 5.1°) and ET crowns (57.5° ± 6.3°) exhibited larger buccal cusp angles than natural teeth (45.7° ± 4.9°) (p < 0.05), while no significant differences were found in lingual cusp angles among the groups (p = 0.434, 0.607, 0.787). The buccal-lingual diameter of AI crowns closely matched natural teeth (p = 0.094), whereas ET crowns were significantly smaller than both AI crowns (p = 0.034) and natural teeth (p = 0.044). The mesial-distal diameter of AI crowns also showed no significant difference from natural teeth (p = 0.223), while ET crowns differed significantly from both groups (p = 0.047, 0.002). Although AI crowns exhibited slightly lower 3D discrepancy (0.43 ± 0.07) than ET crowns (0.48 ± 0.06), the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.089). AI did not accurately reproduce functional cusp wear facets, whereas technician designs tended to overcompensate. Occlusal contact counts showed no significant differences among groups.
Conclusions
AI systems can reproduce overall crown morphology to a degree comparable with experienced technicians but remain limited in replicating functional wear facets.
Clinical Implications
AI offers a practical and efficient tool for crown design, with potential to improve consistency and reduce manual workload in prosthodontics. However, further refinement is required before these systems can fully replicate functional morphological details for widespread clinical application.}

Digital health technologies can generate data that can be used to train artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, which have been particularly transformative in cardiovascular health-care delivery. However, digital and health-care data repositories that are used to train AI algorithms can introduce bias when data are homogeneous and health-care processes are inequitable. AI bias can also be introduced during algorithm development, testing, implementation, and post-implementation processes. The consequences of AI algorithmic bias can be considerable, including missed diagnoses, misclassification of disease, incorrect risk prediction, and inappropriate treatment recommendations. This bias can disproportionately affect marginalised demographic groups. In this Series paper, we provide a brief overview of AI applications in cardiovascular health care, discuss stages of algorithm development and associated sources of bias, and provide examples of harm from biased algorithms. We propose strategies that can be applied during the training, testing, and implementation of AI algorithms to mitigate bias so that all those at risk for or living with cardiovascular disease might benefit equally from AI.}

The construction of hydropower projects involves huge investments, and it's important to estimate the investment accurately in the design and planning stage. Machine learning can construct investment estimation models based on a large number of samples. However, in the hydropower industry, given that Engineering Procurement Construction (hereafter EPC) is an emerging investment and construction model, relatively few samples are available for investment estimation of EPC hydropower projects. This study aims to propose a few-shot machine learning method for hydropower project investment estimation. First, a comprehensive similarity index is proposed to select similar projects; after that, a hydropower project investment estimation artificial intelligence model is constructed by integrating an improved support vector machine and swarm intelligence optimization algorithm. In this study, the investment data of 36 EPC hydropower projects are collected. Experiments show that the proposed method can construct a hydropower project investment model using a small number of samples, and the model prediction accuracy is 97.1 %, which is better than the traditional machine learning method. The proposed method helps to provide support for the comparison of investment and construction programs for EPC hydropower projects, thus reducing the investment cost.}

In this context, medical education must evolve to ensure that medical trainees are adequately prepared to navigate the rapidly changing health care landscape. Medical education has moved toward a competency-based education paradigm, leading the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) to define a set of Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) as its practical operational framework in undergraduate medical education. The AAMC’s 13 core EPAs for entering residencies have been implemented with varying levels of success across medical schools. In this paper, we critically assess the existing core EPAs in the context of rapid AI integration in medicine. We identify EPAs that require refinement, redefinition, or comprehensive change to align with the emerging trends in health care. Moreover, this perspective proposes a set of “emerging” EPAs, informed by the changing landscape and capabilities presented by generative AI technologies. We provide a practical evaluation of the EPAs, alongside actionable recommendations on how medical education, viewed through the lens of the AAMC EPAs, can adapt and remain relevant amid rapid technological advancements. By leveraging the transformative potential of AI, we can reshape medical education to align with an AI-integrated future of medicine. This approach will help equip future health care professionals with technological competence and adaptive skills to meet the dynamic and evolving demands in health care.}

abstract = {Microgrids are the most efficient method for generating, distributing, and regulating power for consumers using localized distributed energy resources. Nevertheless, achieving optimal economic dispatch and power quality enhancement in microgrids is a significant and challenging topic since solar and wind power generation are inconsistent. In this paper, optimization, and improvement of power quality in a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) based system utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are studied. The efficiency of a photovoltaic and wind energy system is maximized in this work by using an AI optimization strategy to determine the best scaling parameters for a fuzzy logic-based MPPT controller. This paper presents an improved fuzzy logic and artificial bee colony (FLABC) technique for optimization and power quality enhancement in an MPPT-based system. optimal economic dispatch solution for a microgrid, with the goal of meeting load and balance demand, while reducing the cost of power generation and gas emissions. The FLABC technique is proposed for optimization and power quality enhancement in an MPPT-based hybrid renewable system. The core strength of this study is in the application of AI engineering, particularly in the field of renewable energy as a significant replacement for fossil fuels. The power that goes from the PV wind to the load is directly impacted by the setting of the input and output parameters. Firstly, mathematical model that considers the various traits of distributed generation units and loads was built, with the aim to enhance ABC's global convergence performance to make the model fit. Second, the key stages were outlined for using the modified ABC to solve the optimal power quality enhancement. Thirdly, several scenarios simulations were highlighted the advantages and potency of the suggested strategy for optimal power quality enhancement in microgrids. The study was conducted using MATLAB/Simulink software for simulations. Under various climatic situations, the suggested ABC-based fuzzy controller's performances are compared to those attained using fuzzy logic and ABC controllers. The simulation results demonstrated that the suggested Fuzzy logic-based ABC controller outperformed the performance in terms of the solar energy gained.}

In this viewpoint paper, we discuss 2 challenges that affect the use of LLM-enhanced CAI for individuals with mental health issues, focusing on the use case of patients with depression: the tendency to humanize LLM-enhanced CAI and their lack of contextualized robustness. Our approach is interdisciplinary, relying on considerations from philosophy, psychology, and computer science. We argue that the humanization of LLM-enhanced CAI hinges on the reflection of what it means to simulate “human-like” features with LLMs and what role these systems should play in interactions with humans. Further, ensuring the contextualization of the robustness of LLMs requires considering the specificities of language production in individuals with depression, as well as its evolution over time. Finally, we provide a series of recommendations to foster the responsible design and deployment of LLM-enhanced CAI for the therapeutic support of individuals with depression.}

Using a dataset generated from high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest models were trained to predict heat storage and extraction. LightGBM achieved the highest predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.966 for storage, 0.92 for extraction).

The current review synthesizes to address the possible role of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) in mitigating AMR. Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing are some of the main tools used in this domain. AI/ML models can use various data sources, such as clinical information, genomic sequences, microbiome insights, and epidemiological data for predicting AMR outbreaks. Although AI/ML are relatively new fields, numerous case studies offer substantial evidence of their successful application in predicting AMR outbreaks with greater accuracy. These models can provide insights into the discovery of novel antimicrobials, the repurposing of existing drugs, and combination therapy through the analysis of their molecular structures. In addition, AI-based clinical decision support systems in real-time guide healthcare professionals to improve prescribing of antibiotics. The review also outlines how can AI improve AMR surveillance, analyze resistance trends, and enable early outbreak identification. Challenges, such as ethical considerations, data privacy, and model biases exist, however, the continuous development of novel methodologies enables AI/ML to play a significant role in combating AMR.}

It is challenging to effectively improve corporate green innovation capacity (CGIC) by relying on traditional technological innovation. The integration of enterprises' green innovation and artificial intelligence technology (AIT) is becoming a significant driver for addressing global environmental challenges and promoting enterprises' energy efficiency and low-carbon development. Combining patent datasets for listed companies in China, this study explores the driving effect of AIT on CGIC from the perspective of “artificial intelligence +”. This study empirically examines how AIT affects CGIC, and further investigates AIT's impact on the duration of enterprises' green innovation. The findings reveal that AIT's intervention can effectively improve CGIC. Enterprises with different characteristics have heterogeneous effects on improving CGIC by applying AI, indicating that the application of AIT has a more prominent impact on heavily polluting, nontechnology-intensive, and highly competitive enterprises. Mechanism analysis demonstrates that AIT can improve CGIC by absorbing high-skilled labor and increasing investment in research and development. Further examination reveals that AIT application can significantly reduce the potential for enterprises interrupting green innovation activities and prolong the duration of green innovation. This study provides valuable insights concerning the effect of enterprises' AIT application on improving CGIC, empowering enterprises to improve energy efficiency and achieve low-carbon development.}

MXenes have shown great potential in photocatalysis application targetingCO2 reduction, H2O2 production, wastewater and dye treatment and nitrogen fixation. For an AI based implementation and model development, the basics of photon capture and charge transfer characteristics of photocatalytic materials, right from biological systems to organic/inorganic solar cells are crucial. This had been very thoroughly worked by compelling computational model and theories. The AI-ML based approaches have been instrumental in identification, screening, scrutiny of advanced materials, especially MXenes for varied applications via the supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning techniques. These exercises have provided the models that can be potentially more equipped for parallelly performing the classification and regression with a higher prediction accuracy. Use of advanced deep learning techniques have aided in establishing relation between structure-feature-properties and applications for MXenes based materials. Finally, a Criteria based AI aided Decision Support System is also discussed that prioritises environmentally sound and green MAX phase precursors for the development of photocatalytic materials.

Recent research has focused on promoting CN and achieving CN goals through the use of advanced techniques. While there is some debate on the use and influence of different technologies, there is a limited exploration of the use of specific technologies, such as AI, in achieving CN, particularly in the supply chain (SC) domain. This research paper examines the intersection between AI-led CN and SC, exploring the multifaceted aspects that define this evolving landscape. This paper aims to unravel the complexities and outcomes surrounding the use of AI-led disruptive technologies to achieve CN in SC operations. The authors conducted a comprehensive review of 47 relevant studies to facilitate a critical synthesis of the literature. Based on an extensive literature review, the study identified various antecedents and consequences of AI-led CN goals, spanning a geographical expanse under the broad themes of Sustainable Energy, Digital and Technological Transformation, Biomass Conversion, Waste Management, and Carbon Forecasting and Accounting in the SC domain. The findings revealed several antecedents to AI-led CN goals, including discussion on energy supply issues, intelligent systems, access to green financial markets, and slag waste optimization, as well as a few consequences of such implementation, such as AI-based methods to monitor slag waste, biomass concerns, and carbon neutrality, among others. The study also developed a framework, highlighting various AI-led CN strategies at the optimization and operational stages, as well as several AI-led innovations and their importance. The study offers a few policy suggestions, such as designing emission reduction policies, encouraging public-private partnerships, developing a regulatory framework to promote the industrial transformation of intelligent buildings, and managing uncertainties related to slag waste, biomass, energy systems, and other SC issues to ensure proper implementation of AI-led CN systems in the SC domain.}

Currently, biomimetic structures are often simplified as periodic lattice structures, while the imitation of natural structures' random yet coherent arrangements is highly limited. This study utilizes a progressive algorithm called SinGAN, which is a modified version of GAN, to capture the inherent randomness presented in biostructures. In this paper, we focus on the ultralight cuttlebone structure, where SinGAN is conducted feature extractions and structural learning. The input for the process includes the 2D scanning images, which are then used to generate imitated structures through the network. The 2D images are vertically extruded to convert them into 3D structures for further analyses. The stiffness of all structures is determined through finite-element-based simulations. Computed results reveal that SinGAN successfully extracts the structural features of cuttlebone. In addition, some property of the imitated structures exhibits much more superior behavior comparing to the original structure. The presented approach for generating imitated structures is one of the first few endeavors to integrate artificial intelligence into biomimetic structure design, to the best of our knowledge.}

Therefore, it is necessary to conduct imaging characterization of the biofilm matrices to deepen the comprehensive understanding of biofilms for their better regulation and application.

Hence, integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into high-resolution imaging is essential for advancing biofilm imaging techniques and expanding their application. Here, we review typical biofilm imaging technologies combined with AI, and analyze the principles of such combinations for advanced biofilm characterization in terms of imaging quality, automation and standardization. Furthermore, We summarize the application of AI-assisted imaging technologies in the static characterization and dynamic monitoring of biofilms. We also consider the challenges associated with such integration and discuss approaches to overcome technical and methodological barriers. Additionally, we outline the prospects for AI-assisted biofilm characterization through interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. Overall, the convergence of AI and advanced imaging technologies is poised to accelerate and further redefine the landscape of biofilm research.

By extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) to include sustainable policy alignment and policy ambiguity as moderating factors, the research explores how these policy elements influence the relationship between GenAI adoption and SLBs’ discretionary actions. Data was collected from 489 SLBs and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings demonstrate that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, and habit significantly drive the continuous intention to use GenAI. In contrast, social influence and facilitating conditions do not have a significant effect. Furthermore, the continuous intention to use GenAI positively influences SLBs’ discretion in policy implementation, with sustainable policy alignment strengthening this relationship and diminishing policy ambiguity. A multi-group analysis reveals notable differences between Iraq and Oman. In Oman, all UTAUT2 variables are significant, reflecting a supportive and stable governance environment. In contrast, in Iraq, individual perceptions dominate, likely due to higher policy ambiguity and weaker institutional support. These results underscore the importance of emphasizing GenAI’s practical benefits and ease of use and advocate for developing clear, supportive policies that empower SLBs. This study extends the theoretical foundations of UTAUT2 in the public sector, offering practical insights for policymakers and organizations seeking to leverage GenAI for enhanced sustainability outcomes.}

However, research lacks validated tools for capturing both the frequency and quality of generative AI use. This study presents the Generative AI Engagement Scale (GAIES), a multidimensional instrument that was developed following best practices in scale construction and validation. GAIES consists of two subscales: the Use Frequency scale, which measures how often users interact with generative AI for self-interested and task-oriented purposes, and the Interaction Style scale, which assesses how users interact with generative AI through Questioningness, Expressiveness, and Preciseness. This study included 414 participants. Several psychometric evaluations were involved, including classical test theory, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and item response theory. The subscales showed strong internal consistency, a clear factor structure, and a good fit. Besides validating GAIES, we demonstrated its practical utility through two case studies. An analysis of a structural equation model revealed that predictors from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology explained Self-interest- and Task-oriented usage differentially, indicating the predictability of the scale. Further, latent profile analysis revealed four distinct user subgroups, demonstrating the usefulness of the scale in identifying meaningful patterns of engagement. These findings establish GAIES as a psychometrically and theoretically sound method of measuring generative AI engagement. A key contribution of GAIES is its ability to go beyond generic usage metrics and offer a foundation for future research into the behavioral implications of generative AI usage.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, notably in ophthalmology, where its ability to interpret images and data can significantly enhance disease diagnosis and patient care. Recent developments in oculomics, the integration of ophthalmic features to develop biomarkers for systemic diseases, have demonstrated the potential for providing rapid, non-invasive methods of screening leading to enhance in early detection and improve healthcare quality, particularly in underserved areas. However, the widespread adoption of such AI-based technologies faces challenges primarily related to the trustworthiness of the system. We demonstrate the potential and considerations needed to develop trustworthy AI in oculomics through a pilot study for HbA1c assessment using an AI-based approach. We then discuss various challenges, considerations, and solutions that have been developed for powerful AI technologies in the past in healthcare and subsequently apply these considerations to the oculomics pilot study. Building upon the observations in the study we highlight the challenges and opportunities for advancing trustworthy AI in oculomics. Ultimately, oculomics presents as a powerful and emerging technology in ophthalmology and understanding how to optimize transparency prior to clinical adoption is of utmost importance.}

abstract = {The lightning development of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized healthcare, helping significant improvements in various applications. This paper provides a comprehensive review of foundation models in healthcare, highlighting their transformative potential in areas such as diagnostics, personalized treatment, and operational efficiency. We argue the key capabilities of these models, including their ability to process diverse data types such as medical images, clinical notes, and structured health records. Regardless their assurance, difficulties remain, including data privacy concerns, bias in AI algorithms, and the need for extensive computational resources. Our analysis identifies emerging trends and future directions, emphasizing the importance of ethical AI deployment, improved interoperability over healthcare systems, and the development of more robust, domain-specific models. Future research should focus on enhancing model interpretability, ensuring equitable access, and fostering collaboration between AI developers and healthcare professionals to maximize the advantages of these technologies.}
