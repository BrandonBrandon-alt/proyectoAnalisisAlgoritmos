abstract = {Agriculture is a vital sector contributing to food security and economic growth, but it faces significant hurdles in food production due to declining crop yields, with plant diseases being a key factor. Moreover, early detection of plant diseases remains a major challenge due to class imbalance in datasets and the difficulty in identifying initial symptoms. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes a novel lightweight dynamic model called DynLeafNet, a deep learning-based architecture specifically designed for efficient and accurate recognition of plant disease. DynLeafNet leverages residual Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) enhanced with advanced dynamic techniques such as Learned Group Convolutions (LGConv), Early Exiting, and Grid Search to optimize performance and computational efficiency. Moreover, the proposed model uses data augmentation to address the Class Imbalance Problem (CIP) by calculating class weights in the datasets. The efficacy of the DynLeafNet model is validated using the publicly available PlantVillage and Rice Leaf Disease datasets, where it demonstrated superior accuracy and reduced computational cost (calculated in terms of Floating Point Operations per Second (FLOPs)) compared to existing state-of-the-art models. For the PlantVillage dataset, DynLeafNet achieved a training accuracy of 99.34%, a testing accuracy of 98.33%, and a computational complexity of 17.64M FLOPs. For the Rice Leaf Disease dataset, the model achieved a training accuracy of 97.81%, a testing accuracy of 95.64%, and a computational complexity of 35.07M FLOPs. In addition, single image prediction is performed using Gradient Weighted Class Activation Mapping ++ (Grad-CAM ++), to visualize the model’s focus areas and enhance interpretability.}

abstract = {Purpose
A gripping keyword emerged in the dynamic world of 2022: GPT or the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), at its forefront, embodied by the mysterious ChatGPT. This technological marvel had been silently lurking in the background for just over five years. However, all of a sudden, it emerged onto the scene, capturing the public’s attention and quickly becoming one of the most widely adopted inventions in history. Therefore, this narrative review is conducted in order to explore the impact of generative AI and ChatGPT on lifelong learning and upskilling of students in higher education and address opportunities and challenges proposed by Artificial Intelligence from a global perspective.
Design/methodology/approach
This review has been conducted using a narrative literature review approach. For in-depth identification of research gaps, 105 relevant articles were included from scholarly databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, ERIC and Google Scholar. Seven major themes emerged from the literature to answer the targeted research questions that describe the use of AI, the impact of generative AI and ChatGPT on students, the challenges and opportunities of using AI in education and mitigating strategies to cope with the challenges associated with the integration of ChatGPT and generative AI in education.
Findings
The review of the literature presents that generative AI and ChatGPT have gained a lot of recognition among students and have revolutionized educational settings. The findings suggest that there are some contexts in which adult education research and teaching can benefit from the use of chatbots and generative AI technologies like ChatGPT. The literature does, however, also highlight the necessity of carefully considering the benefits and drawbacks of these technologies in order to prevent restricting or distorting the educational process or endangering academic integrity. In addition, the literature raises ethical questions about data security, privacy and cheating by students or researchers. To these, we add our own ethical concerns about intellectual property, such as the fact that, once we enter ideas or research results into a generative chatbot, we no longer have control over how it is used.
Practical implications
This review is helpful for educators and policymakers to design the curriculum and policies that encourage students to use generative AI ethically while taking academic integrity into account. Also, this review article identifies the major gaps that are associated with the impact of AI and ChatGPT on the lifelong learning skills of students.
Originality/value

Traditional materials engineering education has often relied on a transmission teaching approach, in which students are expected to passively receive information from instructors. However, this approach has shown to be inadequate under the current circumstances, in which information is readily available and innovative tools such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality environments are becoming widespread (e.g., metaverse). Instead, we consider that a critical goal of education should be to develop aptitudes and abilities that enable students to generate solutions and products that address societal demands. In this work, we propose innovative strategies, such as product-based learning methods and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) artificial intelligence text generation models, to modify the focus of a Materials in Chemical Engineering course from non-sustainable materials to sustainable ones, aiming to address the critical challenges of our society. This approach aims to achieve two objectives: first to enable students to actively engage with raw materials and solve real-world challenges, and second, to foster creativity and entrepreneurship skills by providing them with the necessary tools to conduct brainstorming sessions and develop procedures following scientific methods. The incorporation of circular bioeconomy concepts, such as renewable resources, waste reduction, and resource efficiency into the curriculum provides a framework for students to understand the environmental, social, and economic implications in Chemical Engineering. It also allows them to make informed decisions within the circular bioeconomy framework, benefiting society by promoting the development and adoption of sustainable technologies and practices.}

abstract = {Background & aims
Mitochondrial (mt-) D-loop and cell-free circulating (ccf-) mtDNA fragments, respectively reflecting mt-mass and tissue damage, are promising metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) biomarkers. We previously found that PNPLA3/MBOAT7/TM6SF2 deficiency in HepG2 cells increased mt-mass, D-loop levels, and ccf-COXIII release. We explored mt-biogenesis and mt-biomarkers in patients with MASLD stratified by the number of risk variants (NRV = 3). We exploited GPT-4 to develop and validate new risk scores, predicting MASLD evolution, in two independent cohorts by integrating anthropometric and genetic data with mt-biomarkers.
Methods
A cohort of 28 patients with MASLD (Discovery cohort) was consecutively enrolled for hepatic mt-dynamics assessment by transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Data were confirmed by quantitative real time-PCR in a retrospective cohort (Hepatic Validation, n = 184). D-loop and ccf-COXIII were retrospectively measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum samples of biopsied outpatients with MASLD (Serum Validation cohort, n = 824) and individuals with non-invasive MASLD diagnosis (n = 386, Non-invasive cohort). Risk scores were developed using random forest algorithms.
Results
In the Discovery and Hepatic Validation cohorts, the PNPLA3/MBOAT7/TM6SF2 variants altered hepatic mt-dynamics, enhancing mt-content and D-loop levels (p <0.05) through the p38/PGC-1α pathway. Furthermore, NRV = 3 patients showed an increase in mt-fragmentation at transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and ccf-COXIII release (p <0.05). In the Serum Validation cohort, circulating D-loop and ccf-COXIII positively correlated with genetics [βD-loop:0.17 (95% CI: 0.04–0.29), p = 0.01; βccf-COXIII:0.33 (95% CI: 0.19–0.46), p <0.0001] and MASLD severity [ORD-loop:1.31 (95% CI: 1.01-1.71), p = 0.03; ORccf-COXIII:2.41 (95% CI: 1.69-3.44), p <0.0001] at multivariate analysis. Random forest allowed prediction models named Mitochondrial, Anthropometric, and Genetic Integration with Computational intelligence for assessing hepatocellular carcinoma risk (MAGIC-H), considering age, BMI genetics, D-loop, and ccf-COXIII. In both Serum and Non-invasive cohorts, the MAGIC-H score reached AUC >85% in identifying HCC cases regardless of cirrhosis, outperforming existing non-invasive tests.
Conclusions
Mt-biomarkers have a prognostic significance in genetically-predisposed patients with MASLD.
Impact and implications
The study highlights that genetic variants in PNPLA3, MBOAT7, and TM6SF2 genes deeply contribute to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) progression by affecting hepatic mitochondrial adaptability. It also identified two novel biomarkers of mitochondrial origin which are strongly linked to disease severity and genetic background of patients with MASLD. The use of generative artificial intelligence tools, such as GPT-4, can enhance the use of biomarkers and polygenic risk scores for clinical risk stratification. We developed a customized version of GPT-4 (rsGPT-4), which identified a machine-learning approach (random forest) as the best method for creating prediction models for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The new scores combined the two mitochondrial biomarkers, genetic data, and anthropometric data and outperformed existing non-invasive tests for monitoring patients with MASLD.}

This research overcomes these obstacles by applying feature engineering and selecting features using the Boruta method, which guarantees that the analysis is informed solely by the most relevant features. Applying three machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and artificial neural networks (ANN) to this refined dataset showed that the artificial neural networks outperformed the competing models with an accuracy of 0.84, largely due to its capacity to represent complicated, non-linear relationships. With an accuracy of 0.79, SVM proved its validity despite feature dependencies, whereas Naive Bayes attained 0.76.

This paper redirects its focus from general brain mapping techniques to specifically investigate the impact of AI in the field of epilepsy diagnosis, concentrating exclusively on Electroencephalography (EEG) data. While earlier studies have predominantly centered on the automatic identification and prediction of seizures using EEG records, an emerging body of research delves into the potential of AI techniques to enhance the analysis of EEG data. This systematic review offers a comprehensive overview, commencing with a concise theoretical exposition on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and attention mechanisms. Subsequent sections explore the applications of AI in EEG analysis for epilepsy, covering aspects such as diagnosis, lateralization, automated lesion detection, presurgical evaluation, and the prediction of postsurgical outcomes. The discussion not only highlights the promising aspects of AI in refining clinical practices but also underscores its potential in tailoring individualized treatments for epilepsy, considering it as a network disorder. The paper concludes by addressing limitations, challenges, and proposing future directions for the application of AI in epilepsy research. While acknowledging the transformative potential of this approach, it emphasizes the necessity for greater multicenter collaboration to amass high-quality data and ensure the open accessibility of developed codes and tools. Moreover, the application of AI models in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) has exhibited significant promise in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of epilepsy and seizure diagnosis.

This research aims to identify pathways for balancing energy efficiency improvements with low-carbon transitions to enhance energy security. Existing studies have explored the impact on energy efficiency during the development of AI technology applications narrowly. To address this gap, this paper analyzes China’s provincial energy efficiency from 2010 to 2019 from three aspects: energy consumption, desired output, and undesired output. Empirical analysis shows AI technology applications can significantly boost energy efficiency by cutting energy consumption and undesired outputs, helping improve energy security. However, in the short term, these applications show no significant impact on macroeconomic output. Concurrently, Urbanization level exerts a favorable moderating effect on this process. Furthermore, AI technology applications impacts on energy efficiency are more pronounced in low-energy consuming regions and in the South. These findings offer in-depth insights into how AI technology applications enhance energy security through energy efficiency and pollution reduction and provide guidance for improving energy policies and enabling scientific decision-making in different Chinese regions.}

This paper addresses the critical gap in research concerning individual-level changes resulting from direct collaboration with GenAI systems. A novel theoretical framework is proposed, encompassing three primary constructs: Cognitive Dependency, Emotional Appraisal, and Behavioral Shift. These constructs are grounded in established theories such as Social Cognitive Theory, Cognitive Load Theory, and the Technology Acceptance Model, providing a comprehensive perspective on the mechanisms driving human transformation through GenAI collaboration. Empirical evidence is drawn from diverse case studies across education, professional environments, creative industries, social media, and the medical field, illustrating how increased cognitive dependency on GenAI leads to significant behavioral shifts, moderated by Emotional Appraisal. The analysis confirms the presence of feedback loops, where behavioral shifts further reinforce cognitive dependency, highlighting the sustained impact of GenAI on individuals. Key findings indicate that while GenAI enhances efficiency and creativity, it also poses risks such as skill degradation and reduced critical thinking. The implications extend to theoretical advancements in human-AI interaction research and practical applications for educators, organizations, and policymakers. Recommendations include integrating Artificial Intelligence literacy in education, developing balanced professional practices, and establishing ethical guidelines to mitigate biases and foster trust in GenAI systems. This paper underscores the necessity for ongoing research and ethical considerations to ensure that GenAI serves as a tool for human enhancement, promoting positive individual and societal outcomes.}

Defining optimal therapeutic sequencing strategies in prostate cancer (PC) is challenging and may be assisted by artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools for an analysis of the medical literature.
Objective
To demonstrate that INSIDE PC can help clinicians query the literature on therapeutic sequencing in PC and to develop previously unestablished practices for evaluating the outputs of AI-based support platforms.
Design, setting, and participants
INSIDE PC was developed by customizing PubMed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Publications were ranked and aggregated for relevance using data visualization and analytics. Publications returned by INSIDE PC and PubMed were given normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) scores by PC experts reflecting ranking and relevance.
Intervention
INSIDE PC for AI-based semantic literature analysis.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis
INSIDE PC was evaluated for relevance and accuracy for three test questions on the efficacy of therapeutic sequencing of systemic therapies in PC.
Results and limitations
In this initial evaluation, INSIDE PC outperformed PubMed for question 1 (novel hormonal therapy [NHT] followed by NHT) for the top five, ten, and 20 publications (nDCG score, +43, +33, and +30 percentage points [pps], respectively). For question 2 (NHT followed by poly [adenosine diphosphate ribose] polymerase inhibitors [PARPi]), INSIDE PC and PubMed performed similarly. For question 3 (NHT or PARPi followed by 177Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen-617), INSIDE PC outperformed PubMed for the top five, ten, and 20 publications (+16, +4, and +5 pps, respectively).
Conclusions
We applied INSIDE PC to develop standards for evaluating the performance of AI-based tools for literature extraction. INSIDE PC performed competitively with PubMed and can assist clinicians with therapeutic sequencing in PC.
Patient summary
The medical literature is often very difficult for doctors and patients to search. In this report, we describe INSIDE PC—an artificial intelligence (AI) system created to help search articles published in medical journals and determine the best order of treatments for advanced prostate cancer in a much better time frame. We found that INSIDE PC works as well as another search tool, PubMed, a widely used resource for searching and retrieving articles published in medical journals. Our work with INSIDE PC shows new ways in which AI can be used to search published articles in medical journals and how these systems might be evaluated to support shared decision-making.}

The human genome is densely populated with repetitive DNA sequences that play crucial roles in genomic functions and structures but are also implicated in over 40 human diseases. The computational challenge of identifying and characterizing these repeats is significant due to the complexity and size of the genome, which are overwhelming traditional algorithms.
Methods
To address these challenges, we propose GenRepAI, a deep learning framework to navigate and analyze genomic suffix trees. GenRepAI employs supervised machine learning classifiers trained on labeled datasets of repeat annotations and unsupervised anomaly detection to identify novel repeat sequences. The models are trained using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and vision transformers to classify and annotate repeats within the human genome.
Results
GenRepAI is designed to comprehensively profile repeats that underlie various neurological diseases, allowing researchers to identify pathogenic expansions. The framework will integrate into existing genomic analysis pipelines, with the capability to screen patient genomes and highlight potential causal variants for further validation.
Conclusion
GenRepAI is set to become a foundational tool in genomics, leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance the characterization of repetitive sequences.

abstract = {Background
The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents unprecedented opportunities to redefine conceptions of personhood and cognitive disability, potentially enhancing the inclusion and participation of individuals with cognitive disabilities in society.
Objective
We aim to explore the transformative potential of GenAI in reshaping perceptions of cognitive disability, dismantling societal barriers, and promoting social participation for individuals with cognitive disabilities.
Methods
This study is a critical review of current literature in disability studies, artificial intelligence (AI) ethics, and computer science, integrating insights from disability theories and the philosophy of technology. The analysis focused on 2 key aspects: GenAI as a social mirror reflecting societal values and biases, and GenAI as a cognitive partner for individuals with cognitive disabilities.
Results
This paper proposes a theoretical framework for understanding the impact of GenAI on perceptions of cognitive disability. It introduces the concepts of GenAI as a “social mirror” that reflects and potentially amplifies societal biases and as a “cognitive copilot” providing personalized assistance in daily tasks, social interactions, and environmental navigation. This paper also presents a novel protocol for developing AI systems tailored to the needs of individuals with cognitive disabilities, emphasizing user involvement, ethical considerations, and the need to address both the opportunities and challenges posed by GenAI.
Conclusions
Although GenAI has great potential for promoting the inclusion and empowerment of individuals with cognitive disabilities, realizing this potential requires a change in societal attitudes and development practices. This paper calls for interdisciplinary collaboration and close partnership with the disability community in the development and implementation of GenAI technologies. Realizing the potential of GenAI for promoting the inclusion and empowerment of individuals with cognitive disabilities requires a multifaceted approach. This involves a shift in societal attitudes, inclusive AI development practices that prioritize the needs and perspectives of the disability community, and ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration. This paper emphasizes the importance of proceeding with caution, recognizing the ethical complexities and potential risks alongside the transformative possibilities of GenAI technology.}

To develop and validate an artificial intelligence–powered platform that simulates surgical oral examinations, addressing the limitations of traditional faculty-led sessions.
Patients and Methods
This cross-sectional study, conducted from June 1, 2024, through December 1, 2024, comprised technical validation and educational assessment of a novel large language model (LLM)–based surgical education tool (surgery oral examination large language model [SOE-LLM]). The study involved 12 surgical clerkship students completing their core rotation at a major academic medical center. The SOE-LLM, using MIMIC-IV–derived surgical cases (acute appendicitis and pancreatitis), was implemented to simulate oral examinations. Technical validation assessed performance across 8 domains: case presentation accuracy, physical examination findings, historical detail preservation, laboratory data reporting, imaging interpretation, management decisions, and recognition of contraindicated interventions. Educational utility was evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale.
Results
Technical validation showed the SOE-LLM’s ability to function as a consistent oral examiner. The model accurately guided students through case presentations, responded to diagnostic questions, and provided clinically sound responses based on MIMIC-IV cases. When tested with standardized prompts, it maintained examination fidelity, requiring proper diagnostic reasoning and differentiating operative versus medical management. Student evaluations highlighted the platform’s value as an examination preparation tool (mean, 4.250; SEM, 0.1794) and its ability to create a low-stakes environment for high-stakes decision practice (mean, 4.833; SEM, 0.1124).
Conclusion
The SOE-LLM shows potential as a valuable tool for surgical education, offering a consistent and accessible platform for simulating oral examinations.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in healthcare, with potential applications in nutritional management to improve early detection, risk stratification, and personalized interventions. This systematic review evaluated the role of AI in identifying and managing malnutrition in cancer patients, focusing on its effectiveness in nutritional status assessment, prediction, clinical outcomes, and body composition monitoring. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Excerpta Medica Database from June to July 2024, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Quantitative primary studies investigating AI-based interventions for malnutrition detection, body composition analysis, and nutritional optimization in oncology were included. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools, and evidence certainty was evaluated with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine framework. Eleven studies (n = 52,228 patients) met the inclusion criteria and were categorized into 3 overarching domains: nutritional status assessment and prediction, clinical and functional outcomes, and body composition and cachexia monitoring. AI-based models demonstrated high predictive accuracy in malnutrition detection (area under the curve >0.80). Machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, outperformed conventional screening tools. Deep learning models applied to medical imaging achieved high segmentation accuracy (Dice similarity coefficient: 0.92–0.94), enabling early cachexia detection. AI-driven virtual dietitian systems improved dietary adherence (84%) and reduced unplanned hospitalizations. AI-enhanced workflows streamlined dietitian referrals, reducing referral times by 2.4 d. AI demonstrates significant potential in optimizing malnutrition screening, body composition monitoring, and personalized nutritional interventions for cancer patients. Its integration into oncology nutrition care could enhance patient outcomes and optimize healthcare resource allocation. Further research is necessary to standardize AI models and ensure clinical applicability. This systematic review followed a protocol registered prospectively on Open Science Framework (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/A259M).}

Current research reveals robust defensive approaches; however, there remains a significant gap in the application of Generative AI to develop advanced attack scenarios capable of bypassing existing defense mechanisms. Our work attempts to fill this gap and spreads awareness regarding a potential exposure of Neural Network (NN)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) against AI-enhanced attacks. Unlike conventional approaches that focus on Input Perturbation, Data Poisoning, or Spoofing, we propose a novel offensive strategy called Attack Obfuscation. This strategy leverages Conditional GANs (CGANs) to conceal genuine attacks by injecting synthetic traffic designed to deceive NN-based IDS. The experimental investigation validates the proposed approach against three distinct datasets and different typologies of attacks, managing to successfully deceive the IDS.}

This chapter aims to summarize the state of AI today and how it is being used in process engineering. A more comprehensive methodology is used to characterize and categorize current applications. Present-day methods, AI varieties, and pre and subsequent processing will all be analyzed similarly and classified according to the previously addressed applications. Reverse engineering techniques and hybrid modeling will be emphasized because of the significance of mechanistic models in process engineering compared to the purely black-box nature of the majority of AI. A comprehensive plan will also be developed for using AI in process engineering at its current level. These models can help develop new models for task-specific two-phase activities. To effectively curate massive data streams into valuable information and find crucial data characteristics to solve phase change heat transfer, data scientists can assist in developing and optimizing data infrastructures. Additional computations were performed to more precisely depict the effect of the absolute pressure and, hence, the level of pressure drop on the heat and mass transfer in the adsorption bed. The created models make it possible to examine how input parameters affect outputs and optimize the bed’s working strategy. The maximum water vapor uptake and convective heat transfer coefficient for the input parameters under consideration are 1.65g/g and 1,212.62W/m2 K, respectively.}

The research paper’s purpose is to contribute to the literature by analysing the essential resources and processes required for successful commercialisation, the contemporary challenges and opportunities of artificial intelligence initiatives in Türkiye, and the diverse models and methods employed by these initiatives.
Design/methodology/approach
Within the scope of the research, interviews were conducted with 10 entrepreneurs who established artificial intelligence-oriented enterprises in technoparks in Istanbul and Antalya. All 10 interviews were analysed using the MAXQDA20 software tool. Structured qualitative content analysis was used for the data analysis procedure.
Findings
Based on the research, external factors have a significant impact on the future growth opportunities of the market. Expanding the client base, gaining international recognition, and securing financing are crucial for success. However, the findings reveal challenges in the relatively young local ecosystem. One major criticism is the lack of support in marketing and sales activities for refined products. To address this, providing financial incentives and knowledge transfer to those in need is vital.
Research limitations/implications
Since the research was conducted only with entrepreneurs who established and successfully commercialised artificial intelligence-oriented enterprises, it is recommended that future studies be performed with a widespread sample group, considering this limited situation. Furthermore, to overcome survivorship bias, it is recommended that posterior studies include failed commercialisation attempts in AI ventures.
Practical implications
It can be argued that there is no deliberate approach or model for commercialization. Entrepreneurs often draw from their own prior experiences or observe industry trends. Given the limited financial resources available in the domestic market and the challenge of attracting foreign investors to Turkish brands, entrepreneurs tend to rely on internal approaches for commercialisation.
Originality/value
This research delves into the commercialisation prospects and obstacles encountered by AI start-ups in Türkiye. It comprises qualitative insights into business models, commercialisation approaches, opportunities, and challenges. The data were obtained from interviews with entrepreneurs operating in the industry.}

abstract = {Purpose
To organize the existing literature regarding applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in biopsies and imaging modalities of patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs) and to familiarize readers with the most commonly occurring concepts.
Results
Firstly, we present a workflow that summarizes techniques implemented in AI for biopsies and imaging modalities in SARDs. Next, we describe challenges specific to image analysis for medicine. Subsequently, we describe the goals for an AI study in this field, and the prerequisites to meet them in SARDs. Finally, after reviewing the existing literature, we present the applications of AI for image analysis in each SARD. Accordingly, we analyze 1–2 studies from each SARD and mention key messages and lessons derived from them. Lastly, we create a recommendation landscape identifying unmet needs for AI applications in each SARD. The vast majority of studies employ supervised learning for image classification or segmentation, and rarely for regression. The median dataset size was 116 patients for imaging studies and 271 patients for biopsies studies, while the number of images per study varied greatly. Reporting of multiple performance metrics was frequently neglected.
Conclusions
Employing AI for SARD image analysis ultimately demands large datasets with multimodal and adequately diverse data to effectively capture the heterogeneity of SARDs.

The systematic search comprised articles in the Scopus database, from 2000 to 2023. The results from 48 articles show that AI has been applied mainly to predict compressive strength and slump. Comparing the AI techniques to their R2, no clear trend was observed, i.e., there was no overall best algorithm; and their performance was not directly related to database size. Still, Random Forest obtained superior results in articles that compared multiple techniques. Some of the main gaps identified are the lack of studies with geopolymers synthesized in acidic environments or with waste-based or nanomaterials; and that AI has not been largely applied to properties besides compressive strength (e.g., fire resistance, durability, porosity, and thermal properties). Regarding transparency, authors have seldom publicized their codes, impairing proper review of the models. In conclusion, if properly and ethically adopted, AI is a promising tool for the development of geopolymer composites, which can optimize time and employee resources; and many applications remain unexplored.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in scientific research, playing an increasingly significant role in data analysis and interpretation. This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of AI-driven interpretations of health-related data in comparison to those provided by human experts.
Methods
The analysis utilized a paid version of Chat GPT-4 (AI) to interpret study results, relying solely on table titles and data extracted from the authors' previously published manuscript. The dataset encompassed body composition and health parameters within the context of a dietary intervention. Data from a prior publication by the authors were referenced, as detailed in the methods section. The evaluation focused on comparing word count and descriptive content across interpretations of three tables from the original manuscript.
Results
The human expert's data interpretation was succinct, comprising 160 words, while AI-generated descriptions extended to 426 words. Similarly, the AI provided a more verbose analysis of the pre/post-intervention parameter significance, with 374 words compared to the human's 108 words. Group interactions were described in 44 words by the human expert and 486 words by the AI. Notably, the AI's analysis was accurate, though more detailed.
Conclusions
Chat GPT-4 necessitates precise table titles and well-defined data inputs to generate comprehensive analyses, as it does not autonomously account for all parameters within the dataset. While the AI demonstrated factual accuracy and valid conclusions, its descriptions lacked precision, underscoring the importance of human oversight in ensuring interpretative clarity and relevance.}

abstract = {Many properties of commonly used materials are driven by their microstructure, which can be influenced by the composition and manufacturing processes. To optimise future materials, understanding the microstructure is critically important. Here, we present two novel approaches based on artificial intelligence that allow the segmentation of the phases of a microstructure for which simple numerical approaches, such as thresholding, are not applicable: One is based on the nnU-Net neural network, and the other on generative adversarial networks (GAN). Using scanning electron microscopy images collected from large areas (∼1 mm2) of dual-phase steels as a case study, we demonstrate how both methods effectively segment intricate microstructural details, including martensite, ferrite, and damage sites, for subsequent analysis. Either method shows substantial generalizability across a range of image sizes and conditions, including heat-treated microstructures with different phase configurations. The nnU-Net excels in mapping large image areas. Conversely, the GAN-based method performs reliably on smaller images, providing greater step-by-step control and flexibility over the segmentation process. This study highlights the benefits of segmented microstructural data for various purposes, such as calculating phase fractions, modelling material behaviour through finite element simulation, and conducting geometrical analyses of damage sites and the local properties of their surrounding microstructure.}

The review encompasses studies with diverse subject populations, ranging from 35 to 890 participants, with mean ages between 66.94 and 74.8 years. Results demonstrate that AI-enhanced qEEG analysis achieves remarkable diagnostic accuracy, with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) reaching 93.18% accuracy and 97.92% Area Under Curve (AUC). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) also showed promising results, with some models achieving up to 100% sensitivity in specific classifications. The integration of multiple data types and advanced feature extraction methods significantly improved diagnostic precision. Geographic diversity in research origins, spanning from Asia to Europe and the Americas, provides robust cross-cultural validation of findings. However, challenges persist in data quality, computational resources, and standardization of methodologies. This review highlights the significant potential of AI-enhanced qEEG as a non-invasive, cost-effective tool for the diagnosis of AD in its prodromal and dementia stages, while also identifying areas requiring further research to optimize its clinical application.

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Objectives
To compare the morphological characteristics of full crowns designed by an experienced dental technician and a data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) system, with particular attention to their similarity to natural teeth.
Methods
Twelve digital casts, including mandibular right second premolars, were collected, three-dimensional (3D) printed, and prepared by an experienced dentist. For each case, two crowns were independently designed by an experienced dental technician (ET) and the AI system. Morphological characteristics, including buccal and lingual cusp angle, buccal-lingual diameter, mesial-distal diameter, functional cusp wear facets, 3D similarity, and occlusal contact point counts, were compared among natural teeth, ET crowns, and AI crowns. Functional cusp wear and occlusal contacts were evaluated qualitatively, based on morphological observation and visual analysis under virtual articulating paper conditions. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance with least significant difference post-hoc testing, with the significance level set at α = 0.05.
Results
Both AI crowns (56.2°±5.1°) and ET crowns (57.5°±6.3°) exhibited larger buccal cusp angles than natural teeth (45.7°±4.9°) (p < 0.05), while no significant differences were found in lingual cusp angles among the groups (p = 0.434, 0.607, 0.787). The buccal-lingual diameter of AI crowns closely matched natural teeth (p = 0.094), whereas ET crowns were significantly smaller than both AI crowns (p = 0.034) and natural teeth (p = 0.044). The mesial-distal diameter of AI crowns also showed no significant difference from natural teeth (p = 0.223), while ET crowns differed significantly from both groups (p = 0.047, 0.002). Although AI crowns exhibited slightly lower 3D discrepancy (0.43 ± 0.07) than ET crowns (0.48 ± 0.06), the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.089). AI did not accurately reproduce functional cusp wear facets, whereas technician designs tended to overcompensate. Occlusal contact counts showed no significant differences among groups.
Conclusions
AI systems can reproduce overall crown morphology to a degree comparable with experienced technicians but remain limited in replicating functional wear facets.
Clinical Implications
AI offers a practical and efficient tool for crown design, with potential to improve consistency and reduce manual workload in prosthodontics. However, further refinement is required before these systems can fully replicate functional morphological details for widespread clinical application.}

This study introduces the ChatGPT-supported Mathematics Problem-Solving System (ChatGPT-MPS), a GenAI-enabled learning environment designed to support primary students in developing problem-solving strategies and deepening conceptual understanding. To evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experimental design was employed involving 104 fifth-grade students, assigned to an experimental group (using ChatGPT-MPS) and a control group (traditional instruction). Both groups completed a pre- and post-tests of MPS and interests scale to evaluate their word problem-solving proficiency and learning interests.

Digital health technologies can generate data that can be used to train artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, which have been particularly transformative in cardiovascular health-care delivery. However, digital and health-care data repositories that are used to train AI algorithms can introduce bias when data are homogeneous and health-care processes are inequitable. AI bias can also be introduced during algorithm development, testing, implementation, and post-implementation processes. The consequences of AI algorithmic bias can be considerable, including missed diagnoses, misclassification of disease, incorrect risk prediction, and inappropriate treatment recommendations. This bias can disproportionately affect marginalised demographic groups. In this Series paper, we provide a brief overview of AI applications in cardiovascular health care, discuss stages of algorithm development and associated sources of bias, and provide examples of harm from biased algorithms. We propose strategies that can be applied during the training, testing, and implementation of AI algorithms to mitigate bias so that all those at risk for or living with cardiovascular disease might benefit equally from AI.}

In this context, medical education must evolve to ensure that medical trainees are adequately prepared to navigate the rapidly changing health care landscape. Medical education has moved toward a competency-based education paradigm, leading the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) to define a set of Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) as its practical operational framework in undergraduate medical education. The AAMC’s 13 core EPAs for entering residencies have been implemented with varying levels of success across medical schools. In this paper, we critically assess the existing core EPAs in the context of rapid AI integration in medicine. We identify EPAs that require refinement, redefinition, or comprehensive change to align with the emerging trends in health care. Moreover, this perspective proposes a set of “emerging” EPAs, informed by the changing landscape and capabilities presented by generative AI technologies. We provide a practical evaluation of the EPAs, alongside actionable recommendations on how medical education, viewed through the lens of the AAMC EPAs, can adapt and remain relevant amid rapid technological advancements. By leveraging the transformative potential of AI, we can reshape medical education to align with an AI-integrated future of medicine. This approach will help equip future health care professionals with technological competence and adaptive skills to meet the dynamic and evolving demands in health care.}

Nevertheless, achieving optimal economic dispatch and power quality enhancement in microgrids is a significant and challenging topic since solar and wind power generation are inconsistent. In this paper, optimization, and improvement of power quality in a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) based system utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are studied. The efficiency of a photovoltaic and wind energy system is maximized in this work by using an AI optimization strategy to determine the best scaling parameters for a fuzzy logic-based MPPT controller. This paper presents an improved fuzzy logic and artificial bee colony (FLABC) technique for optimization and power quality enhancement in an MPPT-based system. optimal economic dispatch solution for a microgrid, with the goal of meeting load and balance demand, while reducing the cost of power generation and gas emissions. The FLABC technique is proposed for optimization and power quality enhancement in an MPPT-based hybrid renewable system. The core strength of this study is in the application of AI engineering, particularly in the field of renewable energy as a significant replacement for fossil fuels. The power that goes from the PV wind to the load is directly impacted by the setting of the input and output parameters. Firstly, mathematical model that considers the various traits of distributed generation units and loads was built, with the aim to enhance ABC's global convergence performance to make the model fit. Second, the key stages were outlined for using the modified ABC to solve the optimal power quality enhancement. Thirdly, several scenarios simulations were highlighted the advantages and potency of the suggested strategy for optimal power quality enhancement in microgrids. The study was conducted using MATLAB/Simulink software for simulations. Under various climatic situations, the suggested ABC-based fuzzy controller's performances are compared to those attained using fuzzy logic and ABC controllers. The simulation results demonstrated that the suggested Fuzzy logic-based ABC controller outperformed the performance in terms of the solar energy gained.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study aims to evaluate organs-at-risk (OARs) segmentation variability across 8 commercial artificial intelligence (AI)-based segmentation software using independent multi-institutional data sets, and to provide recommendations for clinical practices using AI-segmentation.
Methods and Materials
A total of 160 planning computed tomography image sets from 4 anatomic sites: head and neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis were retrospectively pooled from 3 institutions. Contours for 31 OARs generated by the software were compared to clinical contours using multiple accuracy metrics, including: dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95 percentile of Hausdorff distance, surface DSC, as well as relative added path length as an efficiency metric. A 2-factor analysis of variance was used to quantify variability in contouring accuracy across software platforms (intersoftware) and patients (interpatient). Pairwise comparisons were performed to categorize the software into different performance groups, and intersoftware variations were calculated as the average performance differences between the groups.
Results
Significant intersoftware and interpatient contouring accuracy variations (P < .05) were observed for most OARs. The largest intersoftware variations in DSC in each anatomic region were cervical esophagus (0.41), trachea (0.10), spinal cord (0.13), and prostate (0.17). Among the organs evaluated, 7 had mean DSC >0.9 (ie, heart, liver), 15 had DSC ranging from 0.7 to 0.89 (ie, parotid, esophagus). The remaining organs (ie, optic nerves, seminal vesicle) had DSC<0.7. Of the 31 organs, 16 (52%) had relative added path length less than 0.1.
Conclusions
Our results reveal significant intersoftware and interpatient variability in the performance of AI-segmentation software. These findings highlight the need of thorough software commissioning, testing, and quality assurance across disease sites, patient-specific anatomies, and image acquisition protocols.}

abstract = {Retrosynthesis is a strategy to analyze the synthetic routes for target molecules in medicinal chemistry. However, traditional retrosynthesis predictions performed by chemists and rule-based expert systems struggle to adapt to the vast chemical space of real-world scenarios. Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized retrosynthesis prediction in recent decades, significantly increasing the accuracy and diversity of predictions for target compounds. Single-step AI-driven retrosynthesis models can be generalized into three types based on their dependence on predefined reaction templates (template-based, semitemplate-based methods, template-free models), with respective advantages and limitations, and common challenges that limit their medicinal chemistry applications. Moreover, there are relatively inadequate multi-step retrosynthesis methods, which lack strong links with single-step methods. Herein, we review the recent advancements in AI applications for retrosynthesis prediction by summarizing related techniques and the landscape of current representative retrosynthesis models and propose feasible solutions to tackle existing problems and outline future directions in this field.

Recently, research has been exploring their potential use in digital health contexts, particularly in the mental health domain. However, implementing LLM-enhanced conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) presents significant ethical, technical, and clinical challenges. In this viewpoint paper, we discuss 2 challenges that affect the use of LLM-enhanced CAI for individuals with mental health issues, focusing on the use case of patients with depression: the tendency to humanize LLM-enhanced CAI and their lack of contextualized robustness. Our approach is interdisciplinary, relying on considerations from philosophy, psychology, and computer science. We argue that the humanization of LLM-enhanced CAI hinges on the reflection of what it means to simulate “human-like” features with LLMs and what role these systems should play in interactions with humans. Further, ensuring the contextualization of the robustness of LLMs requires considering the specificities of language production in individuals with depression, as well as its evolution over time. Finally, we provide a series of recommendations to foster the responsible design and deployment of LLM-enhanced CAI for the therapeutic support of individuals with depression.}

The major frameworks are focused on identifying content and technical knowledge (AI literacy). Most of the current definitions of AI literacy for a non-technical audience are developed from an engineering perspective and may not be appropriate for K–12 education. Teacher perspectives are essential to making sense of this initiative. Literacy is about knowing (knowledge, what skills); competency is about applying the knowledge in a beneficial way (confidence, how well). They are strongly related. This study goes beyond knowledge (AI literacy), and its two main goals are to (i) define AI literacy and competency by adding the aspects of confidence and self-reflective mindsets, and (ii) propose a more comprehensive framework for K–12 AI education. These definitions are needed for this emerging and disruptive technology (e.g., ChatGPT and Sora, generative AI). We used the definitions and the basic curriculum design approaches as the analytical framework and teacher perspectives. Participants included 30 experienced AI teachers from 15 middle schools. We employed an iterative co-design cycle to discuss and revise the framework throughout four cycles. The definition of AI competency has five abilities that take confidence into account, and the proposed framework comprises five key components: technology, impact, ethics, collaboration, and self-reflection. We also identify five effective learning experiences to foster abilities and confidences, and suggest five future research directions: prompt engineering, data literacy, algorithmic literacy, self-reflective mindset, and empirical research.}

Using a dataset generated from high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest models were trained to predict heat storage and extraction. LightGBM achieved the highest predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.966 for storage, 0.92 for extraction). To enhance interpretability, Shapley Additive Explanations and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations were applied, identifying inlet flow rate, upstream temperature, and tank geometry as the most influential features. LIME further revealed case-specific conditions linked to suboptimal performance. These insights enabled a targeted optimization process, reducing computational effort by 63 % with negligible loss in accuracy.

abstract = {Background
The release of the open-source platform ChatGPT in November 2022 created massive interest in the possibilities of artificial intelligence–based chatbots. However, there is little knowledge about how artificial intelligence could be used in nursing practice.
Aim
In this study, we aimed to discover whether nurses' answers to nursing-related questions differ from those generated by artificial intelligence.
Methods
A qualitative consensus group research design was used in this study. We conducted a Delphi study in three different rounds. For the first round, the instrument included 57 questions derived from 10 national nursing expert standards. In the second round, the nurses and ChatGPT were asked to rate the answers from the first round in order of relevance to everyday nursing. The third round included writing an assessment and a nursing handover based on two vignettes.
Results
The study showed significant differences between the answers given by the group of nurses and those given by ChatGPT in all main categories. The results of the third round indicate that the answers from the nurses and ChatGPT did not differ, except for answers assigned to two categories.
Conclusions
Our results indicate that ChatGPT generates answers that are comparable to those given by nurses. We assume that ChatGPT could be an enrichment at the beginning of the nursing process by summarizing and categorizing patient information. Furthermore, it could be helpful for nurses in the care planning phase. Given ChatGPT's ability to communicate in different languages, it might be a possible intervention for overcoming language barriers.}

Combining patent datasets for listed companies in China, this study explores the driving effect of AIT on CGIC from the perspective of “artificial intelligence +”. This study empirically examines how AIT affects CGIC, and further investigates AIT's impact on the duration of enterprises' green innovation. The findings reveal that AIT's intervention can effectively improve CGIC. Enterprises with different characteristics have heterogeneous effects on improving CGIC by applying AI, indicating that the application of AIT has a more prominent impact on heavily polluting, nontechnology-intensive, and highly competitive enterprises. Mechanism analysis demonstrates that AIT can improve CGIC by absorbing high-skilled labor and increasing investment in research and development. Further examination reveals that AIT application can significantly reduce the potential for enterprises interrupting green innovation activities and prolong the duration of green innovation. This study provides valuable insights concerning the effect of enterprises' AIT application on improving CGIC, empowering enterprises to improve energy efficiency and achieve low-carbon development.}

Currently, biomimetic structures are often simplified as periodic lattice structures, while the imitation of natural structures' random yet coherent arrangements is highly limited. This study utilizes a progressive algorithm called SinGAN, which is a modified version of GAN, to capture the inherent randomness presented in biostructures. In this paper, we focus on the ultralight cuttlebone structure, where SinGAN is conducted feature extractions and structural learning. The input for the process includes the 2D scanning images, which are then used to generate imitated structures through the network. The 2D images are vertically extruded to convert them into 3D structures for further analyses. The stiffness of all structures is determined through finite-element-based simulations. Computed results reveal that SinGAN successfully extracts the structural features of cuttlebone. In addition, some property of the imitated structures exhibits much more superior behavior comparing to the original structure. The presented approach for generating imitated structures is one of the first few endeavors to integrate artificial intelligence into biomimetic structure design, to the best of our knowledge.}

abstract = {Background
Social robots (SR), sensorimotor machines designed to interact with humans, can help to respond to the increasing demands in the health care sector. To ensure the successful use of this technology, acceptance is paramount. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology with the potential to enhance the functionality of SR and promote user acceptance by further improving human-robot interaction.
Objective
We present a protocol for a scoping review of the literature on the implementation of generative AI in SR in the health care sector. The aim of this scoping review is to map out the intersection of SR and generative AI in the health care sector; to explore if generative AI is applied in SR in the health care sector; to outline which models of generative AI and SR are used for these implementations; and to explore whether user acceptance is reported as an outcome following these implementations. This scoping review supports future research by providing an overview of the state of connectedness of 2 emerging technologies and by mapping out research gaps.
Methods
We follow the methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley and the recommendations by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Our protocol was drafted using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). We will conduct a systematic literature search of the online databases MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore, aiming to retrieve relevant data items via tabular data charting from references meeting specific inclusion criteria which are studies published from 2010 onwards, set in the health care sector, focusing on SR with physical bodies and implemented generative AI. There are no restrictions on study types. Results will be categorized, clustered, and summarized using tables, graphs, visual representations, and narratives.
Results
After conducting a preliminary search and deduplication in the second quarter of 2024, we retrieved 3176 preliminary results. This scoping review will be supplemented with the next methodological steps, including retrieving the results in a reference management tool as well as screening titles, abstracts, and full text regarding specific inclusion criteria. The completion of these steps is scheduled for the second quarter of 2025. Limitations based on the heterogeneity of the included studies and the general breadth of a scoping review compared to a systematic review are to be expected. To reduce bias, we adopted a system of dual reviews and thorough documentation of the study selection.
Conclusions
The conducted preliminary search implies that there are a sufficient number of heterogeneous references to complete this scoping review. To our knowledge, this is the first scoping review on generative AI in health care SR.

By extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) to include sustainable policy alignment and policy ambiguity as moderating factors, the research explores how these policy elements influence the relationship between GenAI adoption and SLBs’ discretionary actions. Data was collected from 489 SLBs and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings demonstrate that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, and habit significantly drive the continuous intention to use GenAI. In contrast, social influence and facilitating conditions do not have a significant effect. Furthermore, the continuous intention to use GenAI positively influences SLBs’ discretion in policy implementation, with sustainable policy alignment strengthening this relationship and diminishing policy ambiguity. A multi-group analysis reveals notable differences between Iraq and Oman. In Oman, all UTAUT2 variables are significant, reflecting a supportive and stable governance environment. In contrast, in Iraq, individual perceptions dominate, likely due to higher policy ambiguity and weaker institutional support. These results underscore the importance of emphasizing GenAI’s practical benefits and ease of use and advocate for developing clear, supportive policies that empower SLBs. This study extends the theoretical foundations of UTAUT2 in the public sector, offering practical insights for policymakers and organizations seeking to leverage GenAI for enhanced sustainability outcomes.}

abstract = {Traditional ultrasound methods, particularly cardiac echocardiography, depend predominantly on evidence-based decision trees and risk-scoring systems to guide and standardise clinical decision-making. Although these approaches demonstrate some effectiveness, their inherent rigidity and failure to address non-linear interactions lead to inadequate consideration of individual variability, thereby compromising diagnostic accuracy and consistency. Furthermore, these conventional techniques are vulnerable to human bias, which increases the risk of misdiagnosis. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI)-based analytical strategies substantially overcome these limitations using machine and deep learning methodologies. Furthermore, AI can autonomously annotate, measure, and evaluate cardiac function, significantly minimising human error, while enhancing diagnostic precision and reliability. In addition, AI can quickly process extensive volumes of imaging data and efficiently quantify cardiovascular pathological features, thereby improving the efficacy and accuracy of cardiovascular disease diagnosis. AI is widely applied in various areas of cardiac echocardiography, including image classification, disease screening, and automated measurements. Given the increasing integration of AI into cardiac echocardiography practices, we present a comprehensive review of the advantages of AI strategies and their practical applications, aiming to provide profound insights that may help promote automated intelligent analysis of echocardiography.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence(AI) is advancing airway management applications, especially for airway assessment, clinical decision support, and training. Traditional assessment methods struggle with time and precision as complex airway disorders become more common. AI's powerful data processing and pattern recognition capabilities can assess patient imaging and clinical characteristics using deep learning algorithms to predict airway complications. In dynamic clinical environments, AI-assisted management solutions can improve airway control safety and efficiency by providing unique decision support. Additionally, AI systems using virtual reality and simulation training technologies can customize training programs for healthcare professionals based on airway difficulty, improving learning curves and clinical competencies in complex airway scenarios. AI in airway management shows its potential in assessment, clinical decision-making, and medical education. In clinical applications, we must also weigh AI's advantages and disadvantages. This review examines AI technology's current uses, future potential, and limitations in clinical practice and medical education.}
