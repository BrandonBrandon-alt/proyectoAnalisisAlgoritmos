abstract = {Global economic growth has entered into the recovery phase of the economic cycle that is resilient yet slow, while the main culprit lies in the lower growth of green total factor productivity (TFP) caused by climate change intensification. It is imperative to formulate unconventional productivity models that can simultaneously solve ecological concerns and the crucial challenges posed by low innovation-driven productivity. This research aims to explore how and whether artificial intelligence (AI) as a critical dynamic capability to strengthen the development of firms' new quality productive forces (NQPFs). Based on the sample of Chinese manufacturing listed companies from 2011 to 2022, our findings show that AI promotes the development of firms' NQPFs; green innovation mediates the AI–NQPFs relationship, while economic policy uncertainty (EPU) moderates the above-mentioned mediating mechanism. Theoretically, our research extends Marx's view of productive forces to create a new construct of advanced productivity in China. Considering AI as a critical dynamic capability, we also provide insights into how productive forces are formed by human intelligence and AI. Practically, our findings help policymakers and practitioners reduce the impact of EPU caused partly by climate changes through AI usage and thereby predict the next trend of sustainable development.}

abstract = {Purpose
To assess the image quality and biventricular function utilizing a free-breathing artificial intelligence cine method with motion correction (FB AI MOCO).
Methods
A total of 72 participants (mean age 38.3 ± 15.4 years, 40 males) prospectively enrolled in this single-center, cross-sectional study underwent cine scans using standard breath-holding (BH) cine and FB AI MOCO cine at 3.0 Tesla. The image quality of the cine images was evaluated with a 5-point Ordinal Likert scale based on blood-pool to myocardium contrast, endocardial edge definition, and artifacts, and overall quality score was calculated by the equal weight average of all three criteria, apparent signal to noise ratio (aSNR), estimated contrast to noise ratio (eCNR) were assessed. Biventricular functional parameters including Left Ventricular (LV), Right Ventricular (RV) End-Diastolic Volume (EDV), End-Systolic Volume (ESV), Stroke Volume (SV), Ejection Fraction (EF), and LV End-Diastolic Mass (LVEDM) were also assessed. Comparison between two sequences was assessed using paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, correlation using Pearson correlation. The agreement of quantitative parameters was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis. P < 0.05 was statistically significant.
Results
The total acquisition time of the entire stack for FB AI MOCO cine (14.7 s ± 1.9 s) was notably shorter than that for standard BH cine (82.6 s ± 11.9 s, P < 0.001). The aSNR between FB AI MOCO cine and standard BH cine has no significantly difference (76.7 ± 20.7 vs. 79.8 ± 20.7, P = 0.193). The eCNR of FB AI MOCO cine was higher than standard BH cine (191.6 ± 54.0 vs. 155.8 ± 68.4, P < 0.001), as was the scores of blood-pool to myocardium contrast (4.6 ± 0.5 vs. 4.4 ± 0.6, P = 0.003). Qualitative scores including endocardial edge definition (4.2 ± 0.5 vs. 4.3 ± 0.7, P = 0.123), artifact presence (4.3 ± 0.6 vs. 4.1 ± 0.8, P = 0.085), and overall image quality (4.4 ± 0.4 vs. 4.3 ± 0.6, P = 0.448), showed no significant differences between the two methods. Representative RV and LV functional parameters — including RVEDV (102.2 (86.4, 120.4) ml vs. 104.0 (88.5, 120.3) ml, P = 0.294), RVEF (31.0 ± 11.1 % vs. 31.2 ± 11.0 %, P = 0.570), and LVEDV (106.2 (86.7, 131.3) ml vs. 105.8 (84.4, 130.3) ml, P = 0.450) — also did not differ significantly between the two methods. Strong correlations (r > 0.900) and excellent agreement (ICC > 0.900) were found for all biventricular functional parameters between the two sequences. In subgroups with reduced LVEF (<50 %, n = 24) or elevated heart rate (≥80  bpm, n = 17), no significant differences were observed in any biventricular functional metrics (P > 0.05 for all) between the two sequences.
Conclusion
In comparison to multiple BH cine, the FB AI MOCO cine achieved comparable image quality and biventricular functional parameters with shorter scan times, suggesting its promising potential for clinical applications.}

Improvements in energy efficiency and research and development innovation are the two mechanisms through which AI promotes energy transition. The results of heterogeneity analysis indicate that AI's impact on energy transition is more pronounced in cities with a high transition potential, specifically those with a low level of electrification, weak environmental regulations, greater fiscal constraints, and those located in the central and western regions of China.

abstract = {Background
The peer review process faces challenges of reviewer fatigue and bias. Artificial intelligence (AI) may help address these issues, but its application in the oral and maxillofacial surgery peer review process remains unexplored.
Purpose
The purpose of the study was to measure and compare manuscript review performance among 4 large language models and human reviewers. large language models are AI systems trained on vast text datasets that can generate human-like responses.
Study Design/Setting/Sample
In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated original research articles submitted to the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery between January and December 2023. Manuscripts were randomly selected from all submissions that received at least one external peer review.
Predictor Variable
The predictor variable was source of review: human reviewers or AI models. We tested 4 AI models: Generative Pretrained Transformer-4o and Generative Pretrained Transformer-o1 (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA), Claude (version 3.5; Anthropic, San Francisco, CA), and Gemini (version 1.5; Google, Mountain View, CA). These models will be referred to by their architectural design characteristics, ie, dense transformers, sparse-expert, multimodal, and base transformer, to highlight their technical differences rather than their commercial identities.
Outcome Variables
Primary outcomes included reviewer recommendations (accept = 3 to reject = 0) and responses to 6 Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery editor questions. Secondary outcomes comprised temporal stability (consistency of AI evaluations over time) analysis, domain-specific assessments (methodology, statistical analysis, clinical relevance, originality, and presentation clarity; 1 to 5 scale), and model clustering patterns.
Analyses
Agreement between AI and human recommendations was assessed using weighted Cohen's kappa. Intermodel reliability and temporal stability (24-hour interval) were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients. Domain scoring patterns were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance with post hoc comparisons and hierarchical clustering.
Results
From 22 manuscripts, human reviewers rejected 15 (68.2%), while AI rejection rates were statistically significantly lower (0 to 9.1%, P < .001). AI models demonstrated high consistency in their evaluations over time (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.88, P < .001) and showed moderate agreement with human decisions (κ = 0.38 to 0.46).
Conclusions
While AI models showed reliable internal consistency, they were less likely to recommend rejection than human reviewers. This suggests their optimal use is as screening tools complementing expert human review rather than as replacements.}

abstract = {Background
Food-derived bioactive peptides (FBPs) play a vital role in nutrition and health. Traditional experimental approaches for identifying FBPs are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. In contrast, computational approaches, for example, virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations, have their own limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology enables high-throughput screening and analysis of activity mechanisms for FBPs. Ongoing AI research will enhance the in-depth development and application of FBPs.
Scope and approach
This review outlines the general process of AI screening for FBPs, including data foundation, molecular feature representation, machine learning and deep learning model construction and training, as well as evaluation and validation. It also summarizes recent research advances in AI screening of FBPs with different bioactivities, discusses current key issues and challenges, and highlights future research directions and trends of FBPs.
Key findings and conclusions
Significant advancements have been made in utilizing AI screening methods to identify functional FBPs with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, flavor-enhancing, and hypotensive properties, while the research on anti-obesity and anti-fatigue peptides is still at a nascent stage. Deep learning has demonstrated clear predictive advantages over traditional machine learning techniques. However, challenges remain when screening for peptides with different biological activities. Moving forward, data augmentation strategies should be developed within food-specific large models, and a universal deep learning framework based on multi-scale chemical space features should be created to predict peptide-target dynamic interactions. A high-throughput screening framework should be established, alongside enhanced research on AI methods for multifunctional properties like anti-obesity and anti-fatigue effects.}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduces innovative solutions for circularity and waste management. Currently, design quality heavily relies on human expertise, modeling, and simulation tools. Our research explores the use of AI as an exchange tool between designers and end-of-life stakeholders to understand requirements, search for optimal solutions, and make informed decisions. As such, we aim to develop AI solutions tailored to different stages of the design process within a circular economy framework, focusing specifically on the design of products based on recovered second-life components. We aim to enhance circularity by using Generative AI for the structural and functional reuse of end-of-life products. For functional reuse, we propose a recommendation system using large language models (LLM), and for structural reuse, we propose creative design ideas using text-to-image models.

With the growing severity of global climate change, achieving carbon neutrality has become a central focus worldwide. The intersection of population studies and carbon neutrality introduces significant challenges in predicting and optimizing energy consumption, as demographic factors play a crucial role in shaping carbon emissions. This paper proposes a model based on a Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), enhanced with a dual-stage attention mechanism for optimization. The model automatically extracts key features from complex demographic and carbon emission data, leveraging the attention mechanism to assign appropriate weights, thereby capturing the behavioral patterns and trends in energy consumption driven by population dynamics more effectively. By integrating multi-source data, including historical carbon emissions, population density, demographic trends, meteorological data, and economic indicators, experimental results demonstrate the model's outstanding performance across multiple datasets.}

abstract = {Design for manufacturing is essential to fully exploit the potential of emerging materials and processing technologies. However, traditional trial-and-error optimisation often exhibits inferior performance in manufacturability-driven problems, particularly when handling complex shapes. Surrogate modelling and optimisation have been widely investigated for efficiently predicting simulation results and enhancing manufacturability. Nevertheless, existing methods are mostly constrained by fixed shape parameterisation schemes, limiting their flexibility and effectiveness. To overcome this limitation, this research develops a non-parametric optimisation framework, validated on a sheet metal forming case study, specifically the blank shape optimisation of an automotive hot-stamped B-pillar. The framework integrates an auto-decoder, serving as a differentiable blank shape generator, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-powered surrogate model for manufacturability evaluation, and an Adam optimiser for automated shape optimisation. The surrogate model predicts thickness distributions from the signed distance fields (SDFs) of blank shapes, which are generated by the auto-decoder from latent vectors; based on the predictions, the optimiser iteratively updates the latent vectors to acquire a blank shape with optimised manufacturability. The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance in terms of the accuracy of thickness distribution prediction, the fidelity of blank shape generation, and the efficiency of blank shape optimisation.}

abstract = {The challenges posed by digital citizen participation and the amount of data generated by Digital Participation Platforms (DPPs) create an ideal context for the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions. However, current AI solutions in DPPs focus mainly on technical challenges, often neglecting their social impact and not fully exploiting AI's potential to empower citizens. The goal of this paper is thus to investigate how to design digital participation platforms that integrate technical AI solutions while considering the social context in which they are implemented. Using Collective Intelligence as kernel theory, and through a literature review and a focus group, we generate design principles for the development of a socio-technically aware AI architecture. These principles are then validated by experts from the field of AI and citizen participation. The principles suggest optimizing the alignment of AI solutions with project goals, ensuring their structured integration across multiple levels, enhancing transparency, monitoring AI-driven impacts, dynamically allocating AI actions, empowering users, and balancing cognitive disparities. These principles provide a theoretical basis for future AI-driven artifacts, and theories in digital citizen participation.}

Another role of artificial intelligence is in the generation of automated radiology reports, which is a boon in high-volume centres to minimise report turnaround time. Although a validated and deployable deep-learning model for clinical use is still in its infancy, there is ongoing research to overcome the barriers for its universal implementation and we also delve into this aspect. We also briefly describe the role of radiomics in oncoimaging. Artificial intelligence can provide answers pertaining to cancer management at baseline imaging, saving cost and time.

The results revealed two significant relationships: AI literacy strongly influences AI implementation, and bias in AI significantly affects AI literacy. In contrast to expectations, perceived ethics and teacher concerns had no significant influence on AI literacy. Additionally, demographic variables (age and gender) had no moderating effects on the relationships between the constructs. The findings suggest that enhancing AI literacy and addressing algorithmic bias are crucial factors for successful AI integration in higher education, whereas ethical considerations and teacher concerns may play a less significant role than previously theorized.

abstract = {Due to the complex and nonlinear characteristics of the plastic hinge mechanism in steel-reinforced concrete composite shear walls (SRCCSWs), there are significant challenges in accurately predicting the plastic hinge length and providing a rational explanation for the mechanism. Advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms present a promising approach to tackle these issues. However, the development and interpretation of data-driven models for plastic hinge behavior are impeded due to the lack of a reliable and comprehensive analytical framework, as well as the inherent 'black box' nature associated with ML models. This study aims to establish an interpretable artificial intelligence framework for predicting the plastic hinge length of SRCSCWs. A reasonable understanding of the potential plastic hinge mechanism is provided. An experimental database encompassing two types of section reinforcement in SRCCSWs was compiled from existing literature. A Conditional Table Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) was employed to augment the training dataset and create a more extensive database, thereby addressing limitations posed by scarce available data. Eight individual and integrated ML algorithms were utilized to predict the plastic hinge length of SRCCSWs, and their performance and efficiency were comprehensively evaluated. The SHapley Additive exPlans (SHAP) method was introduced to systematically elucidate how design parameters affect plastic hinge mechanisms through feature importance analysis, feature dependency and interaction evaluation, and individual prediction interpretation. A simplified optimization equation is proposed by Bayesian methods to predict the equivalent plastic hinge length of flexural-dominated SRCCSWs based on the empirical models and this comprehensive database. Results show that the XGBoost model can make accurate and reliable predictions for plastic hinge length. Global interpretation reveals that geometric information makes a significant contribution to plastic hinge length. There is considerable interaction between the shear span ratio and the boundary element steel volume ratio. In addition, the optimization equation has shown commendable prediction accuracy for both synthetic and experimental data, although slightly lower than the accuracy of the XGBoost model, which can meet the requirements of engineering applications within a certain range.}

Despite the clinical importance, variability in immunohistochemical (IHC) staining protocols and interobserver inconsistencies challenge the reliability of HER2 status assessment, which is critical for guiding patient treatment strategies. To investigate the factors affecting HER2 interpretation consistency, tissue microarrays from 1063 breast carcinoma cases underwent 3 distinct IHC protocols, and a novel artificial intelligence (AI) model was developed to standardize HER2-stained images. A total of 5 sets of tissue microarrays (Nordi QC, protocol 1, protocol 2, protocol 1 AI, and protocol 2 AI) were independently reviewed by 8 pathologists. The Fleiss Kappa value and overall agreement rate measured interobserver agreement, with logistic regression analyzing the impact of variables on diagnostic accuracy. Our results showed that the Nordi QC protocol had the highest interobserver agreement (Kappa 0.754). AI-based image normalization notably enhanced consistency, particularly for HER2 low cases, aligning scores toward the Nordi QC standard. Logistic regression analysis indicated that both staining protocol and AI-based image standardization significantly influenced diagnostic accuracy (P < .001). The American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists 2018 binary criteria demonstrated the highest HER2 interobserver consistency (Kappa > 0.95). Compared with the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists 2023 criteria, the newly proposed null, ultra-low/low, positive criteria, merging HER2 low and ultra-low categories, demonstrated improved reliability and agreement, especially in distinguishing the challenging HER2–ultra-low cases, which showed an exceedingly low interobserver agreement (Kappa < 0.20) across all protocols. Overall, variability in IHC staining protocols and HER2 classification criteria significantly affect the diagnostic consistency among pathologists. The integration of an AI model for image standardization and the adoption of the null, ultra-low/low, positive criteria may refine diagnostic precision and bolster clinical decision-making in breast cancer treatment.}

abstract = {Beyond fifth-generation (B5G) networks enable high data rates, low latency, and massive machine communications, driving digital transformation across sectors. The integration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) technologies plays a vital role in enhancing the performance and efficiency of B5G networks. However, the dynamic and ever-evolving service demands associated with B5G use cases lead to the occurrence of drift, which can significantly degrade the performance of AI/ML models. Drift occurrence often results in violations of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and over- or under-provisioning of resources, ultimately impacting user experience and network reliability. Drift detection and adaptation are essential for addressing the dynamic service demands of B5G networks. Existing threshold approach and various other frameworks, have significant limitations, — SLA violations from delayed drift detection and inefficient resource management due to frequent retraining. This paper proposes a drift handling framework that determines drift promptly after its occurrence using Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI). The proposed Gen-AI framework is evaluated for a Quality of Service Prediction use case on the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Software Community (OSC) platform and compared to the existing threshold and other frameworks. Also, a real-time dataset from the Colosseum testbed is considered to evaluate the Network Slicing (NS) use case with the proposed Gen-AI framework for drift handling. The results demonstrate that the proposed Gen-AI framework leverages both Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), significantly enhances drift detection and adaptation time in B5G networks. Specifically, in the QoS prediction use case, GAN achieves 98% drift detection accuracy, while the VAE achieves 95% , compared to 85% for the classifier framework, 25% for the threshold-based approach. In addition, a similar kind of results is observed in case of the network slicing use case. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed Gen-AI framework in proactively handling drift with reduced detection and adaptation time, making it a promising solution for B5G networks.}

We also identify gaps in current practice and propose areas for further research. While promising, AI cannot replace the expertise and clinical judgement of a trained obstetric anaesthesiologist. It should, instead, be viewed as a valuable tool to facilitate and support our practice.}

While AI in nuclear medicine has the potential to be a powerful tool to improve clinical, research and educational practice, and to enhance patient care, careful examination of the impact of each AI tool needs to be undertaken with respect to the impact on, among other factors, diversity in the nuclear medicine workforce. Some AI tools can be used to specifically drive inclusivity and diversity of the workforce by supporting women and underrepresented minorities. Other tools, however, have the potential to negatively impact minority groups, leading to a widening of the diversity gap.

abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are an online source of information consulted by adolescents to gain insight into mental health and wellness behaviors. However, the accuracy and content of generative AI responses to questions related to suicide have not been systematically investigated.
Objective
This study aims to investigate general (not counseling-specific) generative AI chatbots’ responses to questions regarding suicide.
Methods
A content analysis was conducted of the responses of generative AI chatbots to questions about suicide. In phase 1 of the study, generative chatbots examined include: (1) Google Bard or Gemini; (2) Microsoft Bing or CoPilot; (3) ChatGPT 3.5 (OpenAI); and (4) Claude (Anthropic). In phase 2 of the study, additional generative chatbot responses were analyzed, which included Google Gemini, Claude 2 (Anthropic), xAI Grok 2, Mistral AI, and Meta AI (Meta Platforms). The two phases occurred a year apart.
Results
Findings included a linguistic analysis of the authenticity and tone within the responses using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program. There was an increase in the depth and accuracy of the responses between phase 1 and phase 2 of the study. There is evidence that the responses by the generative AI chatbots were more comprehensive and responsive during phase 2 than phase 1. Specifically, the responses were found to provide more information regarding all aspects of suicide (eg, signs of suicide, lethality, resources, and ways to support those in crisis). Another difference noted in the responses between the first and second phases was the emphasis on the 988 suicide hotline number.
Conclusions
While this dynamic information may be helpful for youth in need, the importance of individuals seeking help from a trained mental health professional remains. Further, generative AI algorithms related to suicide questions should be checked periodically to ensure best practices regarding suicide prevention are being communicated.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) applications require human experience and insight based on the understanding of complex environments and uncertainties and model predictive performance. However, existing research has focused on applying big data and developing automated processes. Actual user understanding and the consideration of model usability are insufficient. Studies must consider the human–machine cooperation-based approach in developing the AI model. This study proposes a collaborative approach through which the explainable AI (XAI) model, a self-explaining deep neural network for text classification, communicates with users. The proposed XAI model provides users with an explanation for the model prediction along with the prediction results for patent evaluation. Users provide feedback based on the model predictions and their explanations. The source XAI model is refined via relearning by reflecting on user feedback. This study experiments to assess model improvement using the human collaboration method. As for the human collaborative method, this study considers the process of human intervention independent of the XAI model's results as well as the method of human participation based on the explanation presented by the XAI model. The experimental results verified the XAI model performance, showing the highest accuracy (0.890) and F1 score (0.916), such that the model can be applied efficiently to patent evaluation. The XAI–human collaboration model presented in this study can also be expanded and applied to technology intelligence tasks. However, the collaborative approach in this study has complete trust in human advice from technical experts; thus, subsequent collaborative XAI models could be improved by communicating bidirectionally with human resources as a complementary relationship.}

Since more biometric patterns are represented the complexity of recognition changes where low security features are enabled in transmission process. Hence the process of increasing security is carried out with image biometric patterns where synthetic data is created with explainable artificial intelligence technique thereby appropriate decisions are made. Further sample data is generated at each case thereby all changing representations are minimized with increase in original image set values. Moreover the data flows at each identified biometric patterns are increased where partial decisive strategies are followed in proposed approach. Further more complete interpretabilities that are present in captured images or biometric patterns are reduced thus generated data is maximized to all end users. To verify the outcome of proposed approach four scenarios with comparative performance metrics are simulated where from the comparative analysis it is found that the proposed approach is less robust and complex at a rate of 4% and 6% respectively.}

Since then, PKs have become major targets in different therapeutic areas. The preferred approach to therapeutic intervention of PK-dependent diseases is the use of small molecules to inhibit their catalytic phosphate group transfer activity. PK inhibitors (PKIs) are among the most intensely pursued drug candidates, with currently 80 approved compounds and several hundred in clinical trials. Following the elucidation of the human kinome and development of robust PK expression systems and high-throughput assays, large volumes of PK/PKI data have been produced in industrial and academic environments, more so than for many other pharmaceutical targets. In addition, hundreds of X-ray structures of PKs and their complexes with PKIs have been reported. Substantial amounts of PK/PKI data have been made publicly available in part as a result of open science initiatives. PK drug discovery is further supported through the incorporation of data science approaches, including the development of various specialized databases and online resources. Compound and activity data wealth compared to other targets has also made PKs a focal point for the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in pharmaceutical research. Herein, we discuss the interplay of open and data science in PK drug discovery and review exemplary studies that have substantially contributed to its development, including kinome profiling or the analysis of PKI promiscuity versus selectivity. We also take a close look at how AI approaches are beginning to impact PK drug discovery in light of their increasing data orientation.

abstract = {Aims
Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a common clinical finding associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Once LVH is diagnosed, defining its cause has crucial clinical implications. Artificial intelligence (AI) may allow significant progress in the automated detection of LVH and its underlying causes from cardiovascular imaging. This systematic review aims to investigate the diagnostic performance of AI models developed to diagnose LVH and its common aetiologies.
Methods
MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies on echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and cardiac computed tomography (CT).
Results
Thirty studies were included in this review. Of them, 14 were on echocardiography, 15 on CMR, and one on cardiac CT. Regarding the AI methods applied, 79 % of studies in echocardiography utilized deep learning (DL), 64 % employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and 21 % applied traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms. For CMR studies, 53 % used DL, 27 % relied on CNNs, and 47 % adopted traditional ML methods. All studies showed good diagnostic performances, but those applying AI tools to determine the underlying causes of LVH demonstrated the highest accuracy metrics compared to those focused on detecting LVH itself.
Conclusion
AI models designed to detect and differentiate LVH on cardiac imaging are currently under development and are demonstrating promising results. Further studies focusing on real-life validation of these models, and cost-effectiveness analyses are needed.}

This paper presents the proprietary Block model of the Low Voltage (LV) grid control system enabling full control of the power flow in the LV grid using BESS (Battery Energy System Storage). The block system of LV grid control is built on the basis of four dedicated algorithms within three logic blocks, described later in this article. The first two algorithms of the four run offline for optimal power selection and BESS location and for building the training database. The other two algorithms are the procedure for starting BESS operation and maintaining its continuity. The execution device (GPU microcontroller) responsible for the current BESS control is a deep learning convolutional machine, while a statistical shallow learning regression machine (mdl) is responsible for controlling the MV/LV transformer ratio settings. The research was carried out in a real LV grid with high-RES saturation. The model was implemented in the environment: Power Word Simulator, MATLAB and SIMULINK.}

Still, this communication is vulnerable to various attacks, particularly in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) scenarios. This study proposes an Artificial Intelligence-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in an edge-envisioned environment, combining edge computing and deep learning. The approach uses the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for edge node selection to perform packet forwarding and employs a Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) for intrusion detection. This poses a challenge since regular traffic samples are typically more prevalent than anomalous traffic, and the dataset is unstructured and highly imbalanced. Our BiGAN-based model overcomes synchronization challenges between generator and discriminator networks. Training iterations increase independently until cross-entropy loss conditions are met. The trained encoder-discriminator network is a single-class classifier, distinguishing normal and abnormal data. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance on the NSL-KDD dataset compared to similar methods.}

The novelty of the presented approach lies in integration of a Belief-Desire-Intention agent, communicating directly to a robot and ensuring safety properties and verifiable decision making, with large language models that excel in language understanding and generation. We establish a framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms by allowing users to formulate commands in natural language, using the ability of large language models to interpret and ground them into actionable goals, with the proven ability of Belief-Desire Intention agents to perform verifiable reasoning and goal management. In addition, we utilize the ability of this agent to represent and store its mind state, including its belief base, plan library, and history of selected events and actions, to allow large language models based explanations of the system behavior. Our findings demonstrate that this architecture provides several benefits in terms of performance and safety, without impacting efficiency or requiring extensive integration effort. This research contributes a novel perspective on the combination of large language models with symbolic approaches for explainable Artificial Intelligence and aims at inspiring new developments in human-centered Artificial Intelligence systems.}

Our analysis of 84 studies from 2018 to 2024 provides the first thorough cross-disorder comparison of AI implementation patterns. According to our data, each condition has different success rates and technological preferences. AI applications are expanding quickly, especially in research on ASD (56 % of studies), followed by ADHD (36 %), and DYS (8 %). In almost half of the reviewed studies, computer-assisted technologies, which have demonstrated encouraging results in terms of treatment support and diagnostic accuracy, became the main mode of intervention. Despite high accuracy in controlled settings, the implementation of these technologies in clinical practice faces significant challenges. While human oversight remains essential in clinical applications, future advancements should prioritize privacy protection and the ability to assess tools longitudinally. Notably, multimodal approaches that integrate various data types have improved diagnostic accuracy; recent research has shown that they can detect ASD with up to 99.8 % accuracy and ADHD with up to 97.4 % accuracy. A promising trend is the combination of mobile applications and wearable technology, especially for real-time monitoring and intervention. This review highlights the potential and current limitations of AI-driven tools in supporting children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Future development should focus not on replacing clinical expertise, but on augmenting it. Research efforts should aim at creating tools that enhance professional judgment while preserving the essential human components of assessment and intervention.}

We outline the GeoAI applications in human geography by systematically summarising the number of publications over the years, empirical studies across countries, the categories of data sources used in GeoAI applications, and their modelling tasks across different subdomains. We find out that existing human geography studies have limited capacity to monitor complex human behaviour and examine the non-linear relationship between human behaviour and its potential drivers—such limits can be overcome by GeoAI models with the capacity to handle complexity. We elaborate on the current progress and status of GeoAI applications within each subdomain of human geography, point out the issues and challenges, as well as propose the directions and research opportunities for using GeoAI in future human geography studies in the context of sustainable and open science, generative AI, and quantum revolution.}

abstract = {The integration of AI in archaeology poses several risks due to the oversimplification of complex archaeological data for computational ease. This reductionist approach fosters a deterministic view, treating provisional classifications as definitive truths and influencing subsequent interpretations. The reliance on legacy data and Big Data for AI training risks perpetuating outdated ideas and frameworks. As AI expands from automating tasks to interpreting and creating reconstructions, archaeologists must adopt a critical approach to avoid biased and harmful outputs. The deterministic view of AI hinders informed debate. Archaeologists should engage in discussions that address the classificatory, and ethical aspects as well as the materiality of AI. The accumulation of data in AI mimics storytelling but lacks the interpretative depth needed to understand historical human perspectives. Developing theories and narrative practices is essential to making archaeological data meaningful. The shift from a representational to a co-creative view of data is necessary to understand its re-use and the power dynamics involved. Finally, to normalise AI in archaeology, a critical and sceptical approach is needed to integrate AI into the real world and understand its implications and ethical considerations.}

abstract = {Background
As health care moves to a more digital environment, there is a growing need to train future family doctors on the clinical uses of artificial intelligence (AI). However, family medicine training in AI has often been inconsistent or lacking.
Objective
The aim of the study is to develop a curriculum framework for family medicine postgraduate education on AI called “Artificial Intelligence Training in Postgraduate Family Medicine Education” (AIFM-ed).
Methods
First, we conducted a comprehensive scoping review on existing AI education frameworks guided by the methodological framework developed by Arksey and O’Malley and Joanna Briggs Institute methodological framework for scoping reviews. We adhered to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist for reporting the results. Next, 2 national expert panels were conducted. Panelists included family medicine educators and residents knowledgeable in AI from family medicine residency programs across Canada. Participants were purposively sampled, and panels were held via Zoom, recorded, and transcribed. Data were analyzed using content analysis. We followed the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research for panels.
Results
An integration of the scoping review results and 2 panel discussions of 14 participants led to the development of the AIFM-ed curriculum framework for AI training in postgraduate family medicine education with five key elements: (1) need and purpose of the curriculum, (2) learning objectives, (3) curriculum content, (4) organization of curriculum content, and (5) implementation aspects of the curriculum.
Conclusions
Using the results of this study, we developed the AIFM-ed curriculum framework for AI training in postgraduate family medicine education. This framework serves as a structured guide for integrating AI competencies into medical education, ensuring that future family physicians are equipped with the necessary skills to use AI effectively in their clinical practice. Future research should focus on the validation and implementation of the AIFM-ed framework within family medicine education. Institutions also are encouraged to consider adapting the AIFM-ed framework within their own programs, tailoring it to meet the specific needs of their trainees and health care environments.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown potential in enhancing ECG analysis, but its accuracy in detecting atrial fibrillation (AF) in COVID-19 patients remains unstudied. Given the increased risk of arrhythmias and thromboembolic events in this population, AI could aid in timely correct diagnosis, reduce unnecessary consultations, tests, and minimize infection spread. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of the AI-based PMcardio application in detecting AF in COVID-19 patients.
Methods
The study analyzed 116 hospitalized COVID-19 consecutive patients using paper-based medical records, with a particular focus on ECGs. The presence and type of arrhythmias were determined by an experienced cardiologist and compared with assessments by the infectious disease specialists collected from patient medical records and the PMcardio application.
Results
The mean patient age was 63.28 (14.980) years. The PMcardio AI application demonstrated perfect diagnostic performance, achieving a sensitivity and specificity of 1.00 for AF detection compared to cardiologist's evaluations. Infectious disease specialists showed lower sensitivity (0.85) but retained high specificity (0.97). No significant association was found between the AI confidence score and diagnostic accuracy (p = 0.660), indicating consistent performance across confidence levels. Additionally, the AI's severity classification correlated significantly with rhythm diagnoses (p < 0.001).
Conclusions
AI-powered ECG analysis using PMcardio highly accurately detected AF in COVID-19 patients, outperforming infectious disease specialists and matching cardiologist's accuracy. The integration of AI in clinical practice may enhance arrhythmia detection and streamline diagnostic workflows, particularly in resource-limited and infectious disease settings.}

abstract = {Background
The use of artificial intelligence for psychological advice shows promise for enhancing accessibility and reducing costs, but it remains unclear whether AI-generated advice can match the quality and empathy of experts.
Method
In a blinded, comparative cross-sectional design, licensed psychologists and psychotherapists assessed the quality, empathy, and authorship of psychological advice, which was either AI-generated or authored by experts.
Results
AI-generated responses were rated significantly more favorable for emotional (OR = 1.79, 95 % CI [1.1, 2.93], p = .02) and motivational empathy (OR = 1.84, 95 % CI [1.12, 3.04], p = .02). Ratings for scientific quality (p = .10) and cognitive empathy (p = .08) were comparable to expert advice. Participants could not distinguish between AI- and expert-authored advice (p = .27), but perceived expert authorship was associated with more favorable ratings across these measures (ORs for perceived AI vs. perceived expert ranging from 0.03 to 0.15, all p < .001). For overall preference, AI-authored advice was favored when assessed blindly based on its actual source (β = 6.96, p = .002). Nevertheless, advice perceived as expert-authored was also strongly preferred (β = 6.26, p = .001), with 93.55 % of participants preferring the advice they believed came from an expert, irrespective of its true origin.
Conclusions
AI demonstrates potential to match expert performance in asynchronous written psychological advice, but biases favoring perceived expert authorship may hinder its broader acceptance. Mitigating these biases and evaluating AI's trustworthiness and empathy are important next steps for safe and effective integration of AI in clinical practice.}

abstract = {Introduction
Artificial intelligence–based chatbots are becoming increasingly used in patient education, in the realm of colorectal diseases. Perhaps, not surprisingly, concerns about the appropriateness of chatbot answers have been raised by healthcare professionals. Numerous studies have explored the utility and accuracy of chatbots in providing information in several clinical disciplines. This review aimed to summarize the findings of published studies, highlighting the strengths and limitations of chatbots used in medical education for colorectal surgery.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE via PubMed and Scopus in February 2025 for original articles evaluating artificial intelligence–based chatbots in patient education related to colorectal surgery, categorizing them into 3 groups: colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, and other colorectal conditions.
Results
We identified 15 studies, 9 assessed chatbot utility in patient education in colorectal cancer, 4 assessed their utility in inflammatory bowel diseases, 1 involved benign anal conditions, and another involved intestinal stomas. Our findings indicated that chatbots, particularly ChatGPT, can improve patient education by providing accessible information on common questions. However, we also identified several limitations of the ability of chatbots to address complex medical issues which underscored that these tools may complement rather than replace professional medical guidance.
Conclusion
Chatbots may be useful for patient education related to simple and basic information, but not in complex and patient-specific settings. Future research should focus on refining chatbot algorithms to enhance the accuracy and depth of their responses, ensuring they effectively support patient education while maintaining the crucial role of healthcare providers.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence–based models might improve patient selection for liver transplantation in hepatocellular carcinoma. The objective of the current study was to develop artificial intelligence–based deep learning models and determine the risk of recurrence after living donor liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma.
Methods
The study was a single-center retrospective cohort study. Patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma were divided into training and validation cohorts (n = 192). The deep learning models were used to stratify patients in the training cohort into low- and high-risk groups, and 5-year recurrence-free survival was assessed in the validation cohort.
Results
The median follow-up period was 59.1 (33.9–72.4) months. The artificial intelligence model (pretransplant factors) had an area under the curve of 0.86 in the training cohort and 0.71 in the validation cohort. The largest tumor diameter and alpha-fetoprotein level had the greatest Shapley Additive exPlanations values for recurrence (>0.4). The 5-year recurrence-free survival rates in the low- and high-risk groups were 92.6% and 45% (P < .001). In the second artificial intelligence model (pretransplant factors + grade), the area under the curve for the validation cohort was 0.77, with 5-year recurrence-free survival rates of 96% and 30% in the low- and high-risk groups (P < .001). None of the low-risk patients outside the Milan and University of California San Francisco Criteria had recurrence during follow-up.
Conclusions
The artificial intelligence–based hepatocellular carcinoma transplant recurrence models might improve patient selection for liver transplantation.}
