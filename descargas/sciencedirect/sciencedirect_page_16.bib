abstract = {Purpose
To assess the image quality and biventricular function utilizing a free-breathing artificial intelligence cine method with motion correction (FB AI MOCO).
Methods
A total of 72 participants (mean age 38.3 ± 15.4 years, 40 males) prospectively enrolled in this single-center, cross-sectional study underwent cine scans using standard breath-holding (BH) cine and FB AI MOCO cine at 3.0 Tesla. The image quality of the cine images was evaluated with a 5-point Ordinal Likert scale based on blood-pool to myocardium contrast, endocardial edge definition, and artifacts, and overall quality score was calculated by the equal weight average of all three criteria, apparent signal to noise ratio (aSNR), estimated contrast to noise ratio (eCNR) were assessed. Biventricular functional parameters including Left Ventricular (LV), Right Ventricular (RV) End-Diastolic Volume (EDV), End-Systolic Volume (ESV), Stroke Volume (SV), Ejection Fraction (EF), and LV End-Diastolic Mass (LVEDM) were also assessed. Comparison between two sequences was assessed using paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, correlation using Pearson correlation. The agreement of quantitative parameters was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis. P < 0.05 was statistically significant.
Results
The total acquisition time of the entire stack for FB AI MOCO cine (14.7 s ± 1.9 s) was notably shorter than that for standard BH cine (82.6 s ± 11.9 s, P < 0.001). The aSNR between FB AI MOCO cine and standard BH cine has no significantly difference (76.7 ± 20.7 vs. 79.8 ± 20.7, P = 0.193). The eCNR of FB AI MOCO cine was higher than standard BH cine (191.6 ± 54.0 vs. 155.8 ± 68.4, P < 0.001), as was the scores of blood-pool to myocardium contrast (4.6 ± 0.5 vs. 4.4 ± 0.6, P = 0.003). Qualitative scores including endocardial edge definition (4.2 ± 0.5 vs. 4.3 ± 0.7, P = 0.123), artifact presence (4.3 ± 0.6 vs. 4.1 ± 0.8, P = 0.085), and overall image quality (4.4 ± 0.4 vs. 4.3 ± 0.6, P = 0.448), showed no significant differences between the two methods. Representative RV and LV functional parameters — including RVEDV (102.2 (86.4, 120.4) ml vs. 104.0 (88.5, 120.3) ml, P = 0.294), RVEF (31.0 ± 11.1 % vs. 31.2 ± 11.0 %, P = 0.570), and LVEDV (106.2 (86.7, 131.3) ml vs. 105.8 (84.4, 130.3) ml, P = 0.450) — also did not differ significantly between the two methods. Strong correlations (r > 0.900) and excellent agreement (ICC > 0.900) were found for all biventricular functional parameters between the two sequences. In subgroups with reduced LVEF (<50 %, n = 24) or elevated heart rate (≥80  bpm, n = 17), no significant differences were observed in any biventricular functional metrics (P > 0.05 for all) between the two sequences.
Conclusion
In comparison to multiple BH cine, the FB AI MOCO cine achieved comparable image quality and biventricular functional parameters with shorter scan times, suggesting its promising potential for clinical applications.}

abstract = {Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown promise in facilitating surgical video review through automatic recognition of surgical activities/events. There are few public video data sources that demonstrate critical yet rare events which are insufficient to train AI for reliable video event recognition. We suggest that a generative AI algorithm can create artificial massive bleeding images for minimally invasive lobectomy that can be used to augment the current lack of data in this field.
Materials and methods
A generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithm was used (CycleGAN) to generate artificial massive bleeding event images. To train CycleGAN, six videos of minimally invasive lobectomies were utilized from which 1819 frames of nonbleeding instances and 3178 frames of massive bleeding instances were used.
Results
The performance of the CycleGAN algorithm was tested on a new video that was not used during the training process. The trained CycleGAN was able to alter the laparoscopic lobectomy images according to their corresponding massive bleeding images, where the contents of the original images were preserved (e.g., location of tools in the scene) and the style of each image is changed to massive bleeding (i.e., blood automatically added to appropriate locations on the images).
Conclusions
The result could suggest a promising approach to supplement the lack of data for the rare massive bleeding event that can occur during minimally invasive lobectomy. Future work could be dedicated to developing AI algorithms to identify surgical strategies and actions that potentially lead to massive bleeding and warn surgeons prior to this event occurrence.}

Despite the adoption of telemedicine and AI-driven healthcare solutions, disabled and elderly people continue to face challenges in accessing real-time medical services, receiving accurate diagnoses and independently navigate healthcare facilities. Current healthcare systems often struggle with delays, lack of personalization, and inefficiencies in medical data processing, limiting their effectiveness in providing inclusive and responsive healthcare. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an AI-powered healthcare framework that integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and the Analytic Network Process (ANP). RLHF enables AI models to learn and adapt based on real-time user feedback, ensuring a personalized and interactive healthcare experience. Meanwhile, ANP optimizes decision-making processes, allowing for faster, more accurate medical service delivery by considering multiple healthcare factors. This combined approach improves remote consultations, intelligent diagnostics, and seamless real-time interactions, significantly improving accessibility to healthcare for disabled individuals. The proposed framework is evaluated against existing AI-driven healthcare models. Results demonstrate that the system outperforms traditional methods, providing a faster, more reliable, and patient-centered healthcare experience. By combining GAI, RLHF, and ANP, this research offers a practical solution to improve healthcare accessibility for disabled individuals, aligning with the goals of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030.}

A comprehensive AI adoption index is constructed using novel text-mining and machine-learning techniques applied to annual reports of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2007 through 2023. The analysis reveals that AI intensity boosts productivity and operational competitiveness, which in turn prompts firm expansion and increases overall labor demand. Yet aggregate growth masks a pronounced shift toward high-skill occupations, producing a skill-biased unipolarization of labor demand. Input–output analysis further shows that AI penetration in upstream industries exacerbates this polarization in downstream sectors. Policy evaluation indicates that government interventions, especially in technology-intensive firms, dampen the labor-market disruptions associated with AI, with the strongest stabilizing effects observed in regions featuring rigorous tax enforcement and low market segmentation. Threshold-effect tests uncover a nonlinear pattern of rising marginal impacts of AI on labor demand. The employment-enhancing benefits of AI are most evident in state-owned enterprises, large firms, and capital-and-technology-intensive industries. These findings offer fresh microeconomic insights into the employment consequences of AI and provide guidance for labor market governance, industrial upgrading, and human capital development in the digital era.}

abstract = {The global impact of COVID-19 has caused a significant rise in the demand for psychological counseling services, creating pressure on existing mental health professionals. Large language models (LLM), like ChatGPT, are considered a novel solution for delivering online psychological counseling. However, performance evaluation, emotional expression, high levels of anthropomorphism, ethical issues, transparency, and privacy breaches need to be addressed before LLM can be widely adopted. This study aimed to evaluate ChatGPT’s effectiveness and emotional support capabilities in providing mental health counseling services from both macro and micro perspectives to examine whether it possesses psychological support abilities comparable to those of human experts. Building on the macro-level evaluation, we conducted a deeper comparison of the linguistic differences between ChatGPT and human experts at the micro-level. In addition, to respond to current policy requirements regarding the labeling, we further explored how to identify artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) in counseling texts and which micro-level linguistic features can effectively distinguish AIGC from user-generated content (UGC). Finally, the study addressed transparency, privacy breaches, and ethical concerns. We utilized ChatGPT for psychological interventions, applying LLM to address various mental health issues. The BERTopic algorithm evaluated the content across multiple mental health problems. Deep learning techniques were employed to differentiate between AIGC and UGC in psychological counseling responses. Furthermore, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) evaluate interpretability, providing deeper insights into the decision-making process and enhancing transparency. At the macro level, ChatGPT demonstrated performance comparable to human experts, exhibiting professionalism, diversity, empathy, and a high degree of human likeness, making it highly effective in counseling services. At the micro level, deep learning models achieved accuracy rates of 99.12 % and 96.13 % in distinguishing content generated by ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4.0 from UGC, respectively. Interpretability analysis revealed that context, sentence structure, and emotional expression were key factors differentiating AIGC from UGC. The findings highlight ChatGPT's potential to deliver effective online psychological counseling and demonstrate a reliable framework for distinguishing between artificial intelligence-generated and human-generated content. This study underscores the importance of leveraging large-scale language models to support mental health services while addressing high-level anthropomorphic issues and ethical and practical challenges.}

The inclusion criterion was studies that developed predictive models for immune checkpoint inhibitor outcomes; the exclusion criteria were non-original research and preclinical studies. Emerging evidence highlights AI’s transformative role in the prediction of immunotherapy efficacy for treating NSCLC: radiomics quantifies tumor heterogeneity through computed tomography-based PD-L1 and TMB ≥10 mut/Mb biomarkers, while pathomics refines PD-L1 scoring and immune microenvironment classification. Multi-omics integration synergizes imaging, histopathology, and liquid biopsy data with dynamic models by resolving spatial discordance and temporal clonal evolution. However, clinical adoption requires the standardization of peri-tumoral radiomics, validation of delta-feature protocols, and prospective trials to address overfitting risks in small cohorts. AI-driven multi-omics redefines immunotherapy prognostication, but faces interpretability and ethical challenges. Future validation must prioritize prospective multicenter trials, causal biological linking of radiomic features, and federated learning frameworks to ensure equitable clinical implementation.}

abstract = {Many sustainable design approaches focus on preserving the value of the product when it reaches the end of its life and is assimilated to waste: functional recovery of the product or its modules, material recovery through recycling, or energy recovery. However, to ensure the highest levels of value preservation, another approach is to develop design strategies from end-of-life by reusing all or parts of the products into new ones. Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduces innovative solutions for circularity and waste management. Currently, design quality heavily relies on human expertise, modeling, and simulation tools. Our research explores the use of AI as an exchange tool between designers and end-of-life stakeholders to understand requirements, search for optimal solutions, and make informed decisions. As such, we aim to develop AI solutions tailored to different stages of the design process within a circular economy framework, focusing specifically on the design of products based on recovered second-life components. We aim to enhance circularity by using Generative AI for the structural and functional reuse of end-of-life products. For functional reuse, we propose a recommendation system using large language models (LLM), and for structural reuse, we propose creative design ideas using text-to-image models. Advanced technologies like Generative AI are crucial for effective product design and strengthening circular economy implementations.}

abstract = {This study focuses on understanding air pollution dynamics through the integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and spatio-temporal geostatistics for air pollution control. It combines the classic approach with the simultaneous evaluation of multiple machine learning (ML) models to enhance the interpretability of model decisions. Data from a dense network of 52 IoT (internet of things) sensors deployed across an urban municipality and surrounding areas were analyzed to identify key predictors of air pollution trends. XAI is employed to interpret complex relationships between pollution levels, meteorological conditions, human activity patterns, and geographic factors. Spatio-temporal geostatistics serve as the foundation for interpreting XAI in both spatial and temporal contexts. July exhibited the least spatial variability in PM2.5 concentrations, with the hour of the day being the key predictor (13.04% of predictive importance), while December showed the highest spatial variability, with atmospheric pressure as the dominant factor (13.84% of predictive importance). Precipitation was the least influential predictor in both months (3.00 %). Four and nine distinct clusters with significant spatial variability in predictor importance were identified. Analysis of transition matrices revealed both stable and dynamic clusters, highlighting the complex nature of PM2.5 emissions as they vary between warm and cold seasons, characteristic of moderate climate zones. This methodology enhances the understanding of air pollution dynamics and provides a transparent framework for urban pollution control and management decision-making. The findings contribute to the development of smart urban management strategies, supporting sustainable city planning and pollution mitigation efforts, while advocating for the right of citizens to a cleaner environment.}

The goal of this paper is thus to investigate how to design digital participation platforms that integrate technical AI solutions while considering the social context in which they are implemented. Using Collective Intelligence as kernel theory, and through a literature review and a focus group, we generate design principles for the development of a socio-technically aware AI architecture. These principles are then validated by experts from the field of AI and citizen participation. The principles suggest optimizing the alignment of AI solutions with project goals, ensuring their structured integration across multiple levels, enhancing transparency, monitoring AI-driven impacts, dynamically allocating AI actions, empowering users, and balancing cognitive disparities. These principles provide a theoretical basis for future AI-driven artifacts, and theories in digital citizen participation.}

AI still requires the interpretation and clinical judgement of a trained healthcare professional and cannot provide the empathy and emotional support often required in healthcare.
Resumen
La inteligencia artificial (IA) puede ser una herramienta de gran valor para la atención primaria (AP), ya que, entre otras cosas, puede ayudar a los profesionales de la salud a mejorar la precisión en los diagnósticos, la gestión de enfermedades crónicas y la eficiencia general del cuidado que proporcionan. Es importante subrayar que la IA no debe ser vista como una herramienta de sustitución, sino como una ayuda para los profesionales de la AP. Aunque la IA es capaz de procesar grandes volúmenes de datos y generar predicciones precisas, no puede reemplazar la destreza y la experiencia de los profesionales en la toma de decisiones clínicas. La IA todavía requiere la interpretación y el juicio clínico de un profesional de la salud capacitado, y no puede ofrecer la empatía y el apoyo emocional que a menudo se requiere en el ámbito sanitario.}

There are also substantial individual differences in LLM capacities. Given the consistent observation of a positive manifold and general intelligence factor in human samples, along with group-level factors (e.g., crystallised intelligence), we hypothesized that LLM test scores may also exhibit positive inter-correlations, which could potentially give rise to an artificial general ability (AGA) factor and one or more group-level factors. Based on a sample of 591 LLMs and scores from 12 tests aligned with fluid reasoning (Gf), domain-specific knowledge (Gkn), reading/writing (Grw), and quantitative knowledge (Gq), we found strong empirical evidence for a positive manifold and a general factor of ability. Additionally, we identified a combined Gkn/Grw group-level factor. Finally, the number of LLM parameters correlated positively with both general factor of ability and Gkn/Grw factor scores, although the effects showed diminishing returns. We interpreted our results to suggest that LLMs, like human cognitive abilities, may share a common underlying efficiency in processing information and solving problems, though whether LLMs manifest primarily achievement/expertise rather than intelligence remains to be determined. Finally, while models with greater numbers of parameters exhibit greater general cognitive-like abilities, akin to the connection between greater neuronal density and human general intelligence, other characteristics must also be involved.}

abstract = {Household mites, recognized as a principal allergen, can induce allergic rhinitis in over 90 % of patients worldwide. It is indispensable to accurately assess mite pollutant exposure within living environments to heighten awareness regarding mite prevention. Current techniques for household mite detection and quantification, however, suffer from limitations such as complex sampling requirements, time-consuming analysis processes, and high costs, which ultimately contribute to a lack of awareness among residents. Therefore, this study develops an innovative artificial intelligence (AI) technique with multi-feature fusion for household mite detection and classification to evaluate indoor mite infestation levels. This system incorporates a symmetric Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and multiple Image Signal Processing (ISP) models to not only enhance the visual quality of images obtained from scanned Dust Mite Traps but also facilitate data augmentation, thus significantly improving the detection, classification, and quantification accuracy of two prevalent household mite species: dust mite and Cheyletid mite. With the enhanced You Only Look Once (YOLO) model, the integrated AI framework demonstrates rapid and precise mite detection and quantification, achieving an accuracy rate of 85.4 % and a counting error of only 7.1 %. Furthermore, the visualization process improves human visual interpretation, effectively raising awareness about dust mite contamination for indoor environment quality. The proposed AI models offer a cost-effective, efficient tool for assessing mite infestation within homes and increase awareness about mite protection, thereby reducing the risks of exposure to indoor allergens.}

abstract = {Due to the complex and nonlinear characteristics of the plastic hinge mechanism in steel-reinforced concrete composite shear walls (SRCCSWs), there are significant challenges in accurately predicting the plastic hinge length and providing a rational explanation for the mechanism. Advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms present a promising approach to tackle these issues. However, the development and interpretation of data-driven models for plastic hinge behavior are impeded due to the lack of a reliable and comprehensive analytical framework, as well as the inherent 'black box' nature associated with ML models. This study aims to establish an interpretable artificial intelligence framework for predicting the plastic hinge length of SRCSCWs. A reasonable understanding of the potential plastic hinge mechanism is provided. An experimental database encompassing two types of section reinforcement in SRCCSWs was compiled from existing literature. A Conditional Table Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) was employed to augment the training dataset and create a more extensive database, thereby addressing limitations posed by scarce available data. Eight individual and integrated ML algorithms were utilized to predict the plastic hinge length of SRCCSWs, and their performance and efficiency were comprehensively evaluated. The SHapley Additive exPlans (SHAP) method was introduced to systematically elucidate how design parameters affect plastic hinge mechanisms through feature importance analysis, feature dependency and interaction evaluation, and individual prediction interpretation. A simplified optimization equation is proposed by Bayesian methods to predict the equivalent plastic hinge length of flexural-dominated SRCCSWs based on the empirical models and this comprehensive database. Results show that the XGBoost model can make accurate and reliable predictions for plastic hinge length. Global interpretation reveals that geometric information makes a significant contribution to plastic hinge length. There is considerable interaction between the shear span ratio and the boundary element steel volume ratio. In addition, the optimization equation has shown commendable prediction accuracy for both synthetic and experimental data, although slightly lower than the accuracy of the XGBoost model, which can meet the requirements of engineering applications within a certain range.}

However, little research has systematically examined how AI literacy (AIL) shapes university students’ creative personal identity (CPI). To address this gap, this study developed a moderated mediation model grounded in identity theory and social cognitive theory, positioning AIL as the predictor, creative self-efficacy (CSE) as the mediator, and creative mindset as the moderator. Using a cross-sectional design, the study employed structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis. The results show that AIL significantly and positively predicts CPI, with CSE partially mediating this relationship. Moreover, fixed and growth mindsets exerted distinct moderating effects across the model’s pathways. Multi-group analysis further revealed that among students with more than two years of exposure to generative AI, the impact of AIL on CPI was stronger, whereas the influence of CSE on CPI was weaker. From both cognitive and psychological perspectives, this study clarifies the mechanisms through which AIL shapes students’ creative identity and highlights how differences in AI usage experience alter these pathways. The findings provide a theoretical foundation for understanding creative identity construction in the digital era and offer actionable insights for designing curricula and teaching practices that foster creativity in university education.}

abstract = {Recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly large language models (LLMs), have introduced novel paradigms for long-tailed medical text classification. This task is challenging because tailed classes suffer from severe data scarcity while requiring a comprehensive understanding of domain-specific medical information. To this end, we propose a Generative Class feature Fusion with Agent attention (GCFA) model, which leverages LLM-driven data generation and information fusion to enhance feature representations and mitigate data imbalance. Specifically, a generative head-tailed fusion strategy is proposed, which generates tailed samples by strategically fusing semantically diverse features from both head and tailed distributions. This ensures that generated samples retain tail-class identity while enriching their semantic diversity. Then, we design a prompt-based medical terminology learning method, where LLMs can mine critical, especially some low-frequency medical terms, from three public datasets to construct a medical vocabulary dictionary. This dictionary guides our Medical Agent Attention Mechanism, enabling targeted emphasis on important medical terms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCFA achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated datasets. Our code is available: https://github.com/WQYwqy123456/GCFA-123#.}

abstract = {Beyond fifth-generation (B5G) networks enable high data rates, low latency, and massive machine communications, driving digital transformation across sectors. The integration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) technologies plays a vital role in enhancing the performance and efficiency of B5G networks. However, the dynamic and ever-evolving service demands associated with B5G use cases lead to the occurrence of drift, which can significantly degrade the performance of AI/ML models. Drift occurrence often results in violations of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and over- or under-provisioning of resources, ultimately impacting user experience and network reliability. Drift detection and adaptation are essential for addressing the dynamic service demands of B5G networks. Existing threshold approach and various other frameworks, have significant limitations, — SLA violations from delayed drift detection and inefficient resource management due to frequent retraining. This paper proposes a drift handling framework that determines drift promptly after its occurrence using Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI). The proposed Gen-AI framework is evaluated for a Quality of Service Prediction use case on the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Software Community (OSC) platform and compared to the existing threshold and other frameworks. Also, a real-time dataset from the Colosseum testbed is considered to evaluate the Network Slicing (NS) use case with the proposed Gen-AI framework for drift handling. The results demonstrate that the proposed Gen-AI framework leverages both Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), significantly enhances drift detection and adaptation time in B5G networks. Specifically, in the QoS prediction use case, GAN achieves 98% drift detection accuracy, while the VAE achieves 95% , compared to 85% for the classifier framework, 25% for the threshold-based approach. In addition, a similar kind of results is observed in case of the network slicing use case. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed Gen-AI framework in proactively handling drift with reduced detection and adaptation time, making it a promising solution for B5G networks.}

This review article brings the recent advances in the field of photocatalysts for hydrogen (H₂) production up to date concerning the criteria for choosing photocatalysts and the modifications that can be made on a photocatalyst to adjust its photocatalytic activity. The production of hydrogen is being brought forward as an upcoming clean energy source, and semiconductor materials are revealed to have an essential function in this field of application. Different approaches for enhancing the photocatalytic activities of semiconductor materials, including mechanisms and thermodynamic aspects, are addressed in this paper. There is a discourse on using reinforcement learning algorithms in photocatalysis and dynamic optimization of reaction conditions towards colossal efficiency and flexibility in sustainable environmental processes. The majority of semiconductor photocatalysts employed in this study include titanium oxide, g-C₃N₄, graphene, sulfides, oxides, nitrides, oxysulfides, and oxynitrides; cocatalyst-based materials seek to enhance their photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation. This article describes improved compatibility between metals and non-metals during the construction of heterojunctions, such as type I–III structures; the sophisticated systems referred to as Z-scheme and S-scheme structures; and the function of mediators in the indirect construction of a Z-scheme assembly through suitably aligned bands, which improves the photocatalytic activity. In addition, it demonstrates the most critical parameters for maximizing photocatalytic efficiency, such as reaction chemistry, mass transfer, reaction kinetics, limits to light diffusion, and selecting proper light sources and photoreceptors. Finally, this review ends with an overview of how these developments, combined with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, complete highly efficient and sustainable hydrogen production technologies, offering a road map for additional research and development in this field.}

Drugs that interact with multiple therapeutic targets are potential high-value products in polypharmacology-based drug discovery, but the rational design remains a formidable challenge.

The molecular structure generation is performed by a fragment-based approach using a genetic algorithm with chemical substructures and a deep learning approach using reinforcement learning with stochastic policy gradients in the framework of generative adversarial networks. Using the proposed methods, we designed the chemical structures of compounds that would interact with two therapeutic targets of bronchial asthma, i.e., adenosine A2a receptor (ADORA2A) and phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D). We then synthesized 10 compounds and evaluated their bioactivities via the binding assays of 39 target human proteins, including ADORA2A and PDE4D. Three of the 10 synthesized compounds successfully interacted with ADORA2A and PDE4D with high specificity.}

This paper examines an artificial intelligence tutor like ChatGPT, enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation, in a pilot project at two universities. The advantage of retrieval-augmented generation in higher education is that lecturers can take control of the underlying literature used by the large language model. Four courses from three programs with different learning objectives and pedagogical methods were involved to provide as diverse a context as possible. We created an artificial intelligence tutor for each course, capable of answering students' questions by referring to the educational resources provided. Both students and lecturers reported positive experiences. Qualitative analysis of the chats shows a high level of engagement and motivation. Based on expert coding of a random sample, 1.5 % of answers were incorrect and 16.5 % were outside the context provided to the large language model. We found that retrieval-augmented generation reduces hallucinations for topics that are sufficiently explained in the material. Both the online survey results and the temporal pattern of the queries showed various learning strategies. Students used the tutor effectively, intuitively finding the most appropriate use for themselves. A comparison of different courses shows that the same tool can work differently in different contexts. Our results show that the artificial intelligence tutor does not simply impart knowledge, but mediates the relationship between student, lecturer, and course material.

Some AI tools can be used to specifically drive inclusivity and diversity of the workforce by supporting women and underrepresented minorities. Other tools, however, have the potential to negatively impact minority groups, leading to a widening of the diversity gap.

The construction of hydropower projects involves huge investments, and it's important to estimate the investment accurately in the design and planning stage. Machine learning can construct investment estimation models based on a large number of samples. However, in the hydropower industry, given that Engineering Procurement Construction (hereafter EPC) is an emerging investment and construction model, relatively few samples are available for investment estimation of EPC hydropower projects. This study aims to propose a few-shot machine learning method for hydropower project investment estimation. First, a comprehensive similarity index is proposed to select similar projects; after that, a hydropower project investment estimation artificial intelligence model is constructed by integrating an improved support vector machine and swarm intelligence optimization algorithm. In this study, the investment data of 36 EPC hydropower projects are collected. Experiments show that the proposed method can construct a hydropower project investment model using a small number of samples, and the model prediction accuracy is 97.1 %, which is better than the traditional machine learning method. The proposed method helps to provide support for the comparison of investment and construction programs for EPC hydropower projects, thus reducing the investment cost.}

Building on the rich legacy of research that positions youth as designers of computing systems, we explore how to support high school students in designing very small-scale generative language models, which we call babyGPTs. Through an in-depth case study of three teenagers building a babyGPT screenplay generator, we illustrate how the team defined a design problem, developed a model, and reflected while engaging in AI/ML data practices and addressing ethical issues.

Since more biometric patterns are represented the complexity of recognition changes where low security features are enabled in transmission process. Hence the process of increasing security is carried out with image biometric patterns where synthetic data is created with explainable artificial intelligence technique thereby appropriate decisions are made. Further sample data is generated at each case thereby all changing representations are minimized with increase in original image set values. Moreover the data flows at each identified biometric patterns are increased where partial decisive strategies are followed in proposed approach. Further more complete interpretabilities that are present in captured images or biometric patterns are reduced thus generated data is maximized to all end users. To verify the outcome of proposed approach four scenarios with comparative performance metrics are simulated where from the comparative analysis it is found that the proposed approach is less robust and complex at a rate of 4% and 6% respectively.}

Since then, PKs have become major targets in different therapeutic areas. The preferred approach to therapeutic intervention of PK-dependent diseases is the use of small molecules to inhibit their catalytic phosphate group transfer activity. PK inhibitors (PKIs) are among the most intensely pursued drug candidates, with currently 80 approved compounds and several hundred in clinical trials. Following the elucidation of the human kinome and development of robust PK expression systems and high-throughput assays, large volumes of PK/PKI data have been produced in industrial and academic environments, more so than for many other pharmaceutical targets. In addition, hundreds of X-ray structures of PKs and their complexes with PKIs have been reported. Substantial amounts of PK/PKI data have been made publicly available in part as a result of open science initiatives. PK drug discovery is further supported through the incorporation of data science approaches, including the development of various specialized databases and online resources. Compound and activity data wealth compared to other targets has also made PKs a focal point for the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in pharmaceutical research. Herein, we discuss the interplay of open and data science in PK drug discovery and review exemplary studies that have substantially contributed to its development, including kinome profiling or the analysis of PKI promiscuity versus selectivity. We also take a close look at how AI approaches are beginning to impact PK drug discovery in light of their increasing data orientation.

In this study, we provide a systematic literature review of the technique for detecting AI content, especially text and images, using watermarking, spanning studies from 2010 to 2025. Studies included in this review were peer-reviewed articles that applied watermarking to effectively distinguish AI-generated content from real or human-written content. We report strong past and current approaches to detecting watermarking-based AI content, especially text and images. This includes an analysis of how watermarking methods are used on AI-generated content, their role in enhancing performance, and a detail comparative analysis of notable techniques. Furthermore, we discuss how these methods have been evaluated, identify the research gaps and potential solutions. Our findings provide valuable insights for future watermarking-based AI content detection researchers, applications and organizations seeking to implement watermarking solutions in potential applications.

abstract = {Aims
Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a common clinical finding associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Once LVH is diagnosed, defining its cause has crucial clinical implications. Artificial intelligence (AI) may allow significant progress in the automated detection of LVH and its underlying causes from cardiovascular imaging. This systematic review aims to investigate the diagnostic performance of AI models developed to diagnose LVH and its common aetiologies.
Methods
MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies on echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and cardiac computed tomography (CT).
Results
Thirty studies were included in this review. Of them, 14 were on echocardiography, 15 on CMR, and one on cardiac CT. Regarding the AI methods applied, 79 % of studies in echocardiography utilized deep learning (DL), 64 % employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and 21 % applied traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms. For CMR studies, 53 % used DL, 27 % relied on CNNs, and 47 % adopted traditional ML methods. All studies showed good diagnostic performances, but those applying AI tools to determine the underlying causes of LVH demonstrated the highest accuracy metrics compared to those focused on detecting LVH itself.
Conclusion
AI models designed to detect and differentiate LVH on cardiac imaging are currently under development and are demonstrating promising results. Further studies focusing on real-life validation of these models, and cost-effectiveness analyses are needed.}

abstract = {This paper presents the development of an innovative communication interface between humans and robots, designed for human-in-the-loop interaction with a user interface through natural language. The novelty of the presented approach lies in integration of a Belief-Desire-Intention agent, communicating directly to a robot and ensuring safety properties and verifiable decision making, with large language models that excel in language understanding and generation. We establish a framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms by allowing users to formulate commands in natural language, using the ability of large language models to interpret and ground them into actionable goals, with the proven ability of Belief-Desire Intention agents to perform verifiable reasoning and goal management. In addition, we utilize the ability of this agent to represent and store its mind state, including its belief base, plan library, and history of selected events and actions, to allow large language models based explanations of the system behavior. Our findings demonstrate that this architecture provides several benefits in terms of performance and safety, without impacting efficiency or requiring extensive integration effort. This research contributes a novel perspective on the combination of large language models with symbolic approaches for explainable Artificial Intelligence and aims at inspiring new developments in human-centered Artificial Intelligence systems.}

abstract = {The negative impact of carbon emissions has received greater attention and is a significant challenge. Recent research has focused on promoting CN and achieving CN goals through the use of advanced techniques. While there is some debate on the use and influence of different technologies, there is a limited exploration of the use of specific technologies, such as AI, in achieving CN, particularly in the supply chain (SC) domain. This research paper examines the intersection between AI-led CN and SC, exploring the multifaceted aspects that define this evolving landscape. This paper aims to unravel the complexities and outcomes surrounding the use of AI-led disruptive technologies to achieve CN in SC operations. The authors conducted a comprehensive review of 47 relevant studies to facilitate a critical synthesis of the literature. Based on an extensive literature review, the study identified various antecedents and consequences of AI-led CN goals, spanning a geographical expanse under the broad themes of Sustainable Energy, Digital and Technological Transformation, Biomass Conversion, Waste Management, and Carbon Forecasting and Accounting in the SC domain. The findings revealed several antecedents to AI-led CN goals, including discussion on energy supply issues, intelligent systems, access to green financial markets, and slag waste optimization, as well as a few consequences of such implementation, such as AI-based methods to monitor slag waste, biomass concerns, and carbon neutrality, among others. The study also developed a framework, highlighting various AI-led CN strategies at the optimization and operational stages, as well as several AI-led innovations and their importance. The study offers a few policy suggestions, such as designing emission reduction policies, encouraging public-private partnerships, developing a regulatory framework to promote the industrial transformation of intelligent buildings, and managing uncertainties related to slag waste, biomass, energy systems, and other SC issues to ensure proper implementation of AI-led CN systems in the SC domain.}

Therefore, it is necessary to conduct imaging characterization of the biofilm matrices to deepen the comprehensive understanding of biofilms for their better regulation and application. Despite substantial progress in biofilm characterization via high-resolution imaging, traditional techniques are generally insufficient to comprehensively capture the heterogeneity and dynamics of biofilm matrices. Hence, integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into high-resolution imaging is essential for advancing biofilm imaging techniques and expanding their application. Here, we review typical biofilm imaging technologies combined with AI, and analyze the principles of such combinations for advanced biofilm characterization in terms of imaging quality, automation and standardization. Furthermore, We summarize the application of AI-assisted imaging technologies in the static characterization and dynamic monitoring of biofilms. We also consider the challenges associated with such integration and discuss approaches to overcome technical and methodological barriers. Additionally, we outline the prospects for AI-assisted biofilm characterization through interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. Overall, the convergence of AI and advanced imaging technologies is poised to accelerate and further redefine the landscape of biofilm research. The future of biofilm research promises transformative breakthroughs in understanding microbial communities and their impact on health, environment, and biotechnology.}

However, research lacks validated tools for capturing both the frequency and quality of generative AI use. This study presents the Generative AI Engagement Scale (GAIES), a multidimensional instrument that was developed following best practices in scale construction and validation. GAIES consists of two subscales: the Use Frequency scale, which measures how often users interact with generative AI for self-interested and task-oriented purposes, and the Interaction Style scale, which assesses how users interact with generative AI through Questioningness, Expressiveness, and Preciseness. This study included 414 participants. Several psychometric evaluations were involved, including classical test theory, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and item response theory. The subscales showed strong internal consistency, a clear factor structure, and a good fit. Besides validating GAIES, we demonstrated its practical utility through two case studies. An analysis of a structural equation model revealed that predictors from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology explained Self-interest- and Task-oriented usage differentially, indicating the predictability of the scale. Further, latent profile analysis revealed four distinct user subgroups, demonstrating the usefulness of the scale in identifying meaningful patterns of engagement. These findings establish GAIES as a psychometrically and theoretically sound method of measuring generative AI engagement. A key contribution of GAIES is its ability to go beyond generic usage metrics and offer a foundation for future research into the behavioral implications of generative AI usage.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence–based models might improve patient selection for liver transplantation in hepatocellular carcinoma. The objective of the current study was to develop artificial intelligence–based deep learning models and determine the risk of recurrence after living donor liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma.
Methods
The study was a single-center retrospective cohort study. Patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma were divided into training and validation cohorts (n = 192). The deep learning models were used to stratify patients in the training cohort into low- and high-risk groups, and 5-year recurrence-free survival was assessed in the validation cohort.
Results
The median follow-up period was 59.1 (33.9–72.4) months. The artificial intelligence model (pretransplant factors) had an area under the curve of 0.86 in the training cohort and 0.71 in the validation cohort. The largest tumor diameter and alpha-fetoprotein level had the greatest Shapley Additive exPlanations values for recurrence (>0.4). The 5-year recurrence-free survival rates in the low- and high-risk groups were 92.6% and 45% (P < .001). In the second artificial intelligence model (pretransplant factors + grade), the area under the curve for the validation cohort was 0.77, with 5-year recurrence-free survival rates of 96% and 30% in the low- and high-risk groups (P < .001). None of the low-risk patients outside the Milan and University of California San Francisco Criteria had recurrence during follow-up.
Conclusions
The artificial intelligence–based hepatocellular carcinoma transplant recurrence models might improve patient selection for liver transplantation.}
