abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming a crucial issue for society. But the flourishing communication about AI makes it more difficult to understand what AI actually is and what role AI takes in society. From a systems theory perspective, we propose that to understand AI is to understand how societal subsystems deal with AI. To investigate the different constructions of AI we use text mining methods on the discursive structure, the semantics, and their trends over the past 20 years. We compare two subsystems – science and mass media – with getting insights from two databases – OpenAlex and Wikipedia. In science, AI is a computer science topic, consisting of four main strands: computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and machine learning. AI as a research topic appears as a driver of scientific development that underlies machine learnization. AI as a media and broadcasting topic on Wikipedia is stable and concentrates on science, big technological firms, and science fiction. The respective pages are oriented towards the perspective of everyday life and range from personal assistance systems over sci-fi franchises to philosophical currents. We diagnose a trend from speculation to application in the attention AI receives on Wikipedia. Other systems like polity, law, or social movements do not play (at the moment) an important role in either system. Taken together, the trends point to a peculiar divergence between exaggerated expectations, everyday applications and societal debates about potentials, limits, and challenges.}

This article demonstrates the use of generative AI in the selection of relevant literature as part of a systematic review on indicators of ecosystem condition. We highlight, through the development of an optimal prompt to communicate inclusion and exclusion criteria, the need to describe ecosystem condition as a multidimensional concept whilst also maintaining clarity on what does not meet the criteria of comprehensiveness. We show that, although not completely infallible, the GPT-3.5 model significantly outperforms traditional literature screening processes in terms of speed and efficiency whilst correctly selecting 83 % of relevant literature for review. Our study highlights the importance of precision in prompt design and the setting of query parameters for the AI model and opens the perspective for future work using language models to contextualize complex concepts in the environmental sciences. Future development of this methodology in tandem with the continued evolution of the accessibility and capacity of AI tools presents a great potential to improve evidence synthesis through gains in efficiency and possible scope.}

A retrospective analysis included 55 patients divided into two cohorts: one with non-AI-assisted PB diagnosis (n = 25) and another with AI-assisted PB diagnosis (n = 30). Pathological assessments recorded tumor size, Gleason score, Grade Group, and perineural invasion. The correlation between PB and RP results was analyzed, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. AI-assisted PB diagnosis showed faster reporting times by 24 hours, enhancing workflow efficiency. AI assistance improved the correlation of tumor size between PB and RP, showing a substantial agreement (R=0.646, p < 0.001) compared to non-AI (R=0.479, p = 0.015). Gleason Score concordance increased by 13 % in the AI-assisted group, achieving 73.3 % versus 60 % in the non-AI-assisted group.

Overcrowding and long wait times in emergency departments (EDs) remain global challenges that negatively affect patient outcomes and staff satisfaction. As an emerging technology, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential to optimize ED operations and reduce wait times.
Objective
Establish a strategy to evaluate AI modeling as it relates to utilizing AI based strategies for ED flow.
Methods
We searched Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Scopus for English-language studies published from January 1, 1946, to August 17, 2023, and we will update our search to ensure currency. The ROBINS-I tool assessed study quality, while PROBAST examined the risk of bias and applicability.
Results
Out of 17,569 screened studies, 65 full-text articles were evaluated for eligibility, with 16 quantitative observational studies meeting inclusion criteria. The best-performing algorithms included regression-based methods (n = 2), traditional single-model machine learning (n = 8), neural networks/deep learning (n = 3), natural language processing (n = 1), and ensemble methods (n = 2). None of the studies examined AI’s impact in a real ED setting, though four simulations reported wait-time reductions ranging from 7 to 43.2 minutes.
Conclusions
AI integration in ED is still in its infancy. Our review found no real-world ED implementation studies, and most of the existing research lacked involvement from ED experts. This gap highlights the lack of insight into AI’s practical impact. Future reviews and research must clarify these dimensions, guiding AI's effective, collaborative adoption in ED workflows.}

Suicide remains a critical global public health issue, with approximately 800,000 deaths annually. Despite various prevention efforts, suicide rates are rising, highlighting the need for more effective strategies. Traditional suicide risk assessment methods often fall short in accuracy and predictive capability. This has driven interest in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML), as a potential solution. This paper reviews systematic evaluations of AI's effectiveness in predicting suicide risk, aiming to explore AI's potential while addressing its challenges and limitations.
Methodology
A meta-research approach was used to review existing systematic reviews on AI's role in suicide risk prediction. Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science for publications from 2004 to 2024. Relevant studies were selected based on specific inclusion criteria, and data were extracted on review characteristics, AI techniques, outcomes, and methodological quality. The review focuses on AI/ML models predicting suicidal ideation (SI), suicide attempts (SA), and suicide deaths (SD) separately, excluding non-suicidal self-injury.
Results
Out of 96 initial articles, 23 met the inclusion criteria for full-text review. Most studies focused on developing ML models to identify suicide risk, showing promising results in enhancing accuracy and effectiveness. These models utilize various data sources and analytical techniques. However, challenges remain, including high bias risk and issues with interpretability, which necessitate further validation and refinement of AI-driven methods.
Conclusion
The review underscores the significant potential of AI, especially ML, in predicting suicide risk and attempts. Although ML models show promise, challenges like data limitations, bias, and interpretability issues need addressing. Continued research and ethical scrutiny are crucial to fully realize AI's potential in suicide prevention.}

abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based artificial intelligence (AI) in the preoperative prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Methods
A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted up to May 2025, following PRISMA guidelines. Studies using MRI-based AI models with histopathologically confirmed MVI were included. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Statistical synthesis used bivariate random-effects models.
Results
Twenty-nine studies were included, totaling 2838 internal and 1161 external validation cases. Pooled internal validation showed a sensitivity of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.76–0.85), specificity of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78–0.85), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 19.33 (95% CI: 13.15–28.42), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91). External validation yielded a comparable AUC of 0.85. Traditional machine learning methods achieved higher sensitivity than deep learning approaches in both internal and external validation cohorts (both P < 0.05). Studies incorporating both radiomics and clinical features demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity compared to radiomics-only models (P < 0.01).
Conclusions
MRI-based AI demonstrates high performance for preoperative prediction of MVI in HCC, particularly for MRI-based models that combine multimodal imaging and clinical variables. However, substantial heterogeneity and low GRADE levels may affect the strength of the evidence, highlighting the need for methodological standardization and multicenter prospective validation to ensure clinical applicability.}

Ten essays were generated using a text prompt, “Tell us in 1-2 paragraphs why you are considering the University of Rochester for General Surgery residency” (Current trainees: n = 5, ChatGPT: n = 5). Ten blinded faculty reviewers rated essays (ten-point Likert scale) on the following criteria: desire to interview, relevance to the general surgery residency, overall impression, and AI- or human-generated; with scores and identification error rates compared between the groups.
Results
There were no differences between groups for %total points (ChatGPT 66.0 ± 13.5%, human 70.0 ± 23.0%, P = 0.508) or identification error rates (ChatGPT 40.0 ± 35.0%, human 20.0 ± 30.0%, P = 0.175). Except for one, all essays were identified incorrectly by at least two reviewers. Essays identified as human-generated received higher overall impression scores (area under the curve: 0.82 ± 0.04, P < 0.01).
Conclusions
Whether use of AI tools for academic purposes should constitute academic dishonesty is controversial. We demonstrate that human and AI-generated essays are similar in quality, but there is bias against presumed AI-generated essays. Faculty are not able to reliably differentiate human from AI-generated essays, thus bias may be misdirected. AI-tools are becoming ubiquitous and their use is not easily detected. Faculty must expect these tools to play increasing roles in medical education.}

A new deep reinforcement learning-based (DRL-based) bandwidth allocation system for real-time, dynamic management of 5G radio access networks is proposed in this paper. Unlike rule-based and static strategies, the proposed system dynamically updates itself according to shifting network conditions such as traffic load and channel conditions to maximize the achievable throughput, fairness, and compliance with QoS requirements. By using extensive simulations mimicking real-world 5G scenarios, the proposed DRL model outperforms current baselines like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), linear regression, round-robin, and greedy algorithms. It attains 90%–95% of the maximum theoretical achievable throughput and nearly twice the conventional equal allocation. It is also shown to react well under delay and reliability constraints, outperforming round-robin (hindered by excessive delay and packet loss) and proving to be more efficient than greedy approaches. In conclusion, the efficiency of DRL in optimizing the allocation of bandwidth is highlighted, and its potential to realize self-optimizing, Artificial Intelligence-assisted (AI-assisted) resource management in 5G as well as upcoming 6G networks is revealed.}

abstract = {Background and Objectives
The inherent complexity of medical documents remains a barrier to patient literacy and engagement. Aligning these documents with specific patient literacy levels and reading preferences without compromising semantic meaning can improve patient comprehension and participation in their care. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the GPT-4 large language model in simplifying operative reports, assess patient preferences for original versus artificial intelligence (AI) simplified reports, and elucidate attitudes on AI in medical documentation.
Methods
A two-phase prospective study was conducted from June to October 2023. We surveyed adults 18 years or older who had undergone spine surgery. A total of 3,932 patients were identified, with 360 completing the initial survey, and 251 completing the subsequent evaluation. Phase 1 involved surveying patient preferences and attitudes towards operative reports and AI. Phase 2 involved comparing patients' perceptions of their original operative reports to those simplified by AI. Reports were also reviewed by two independent physicians for quality and safety. The primary outcome measured was patient preference for either the original or the AI-simplified operative report. Secondary measures included readability, comprehensibility, overall satisfaction with the document, linguistic metrics, and physician review.
Results
The primary outcome showed that 55.4% (95% CI 48.6-61.2%) of participants preferred the GPT-simplified reports for being significantly clearer (mean 1.53±0.83 vs 1.98±1.92, p<0.001), terminology being more accessible (mean 1.50±0.70 vs 2.31±0.89, p<0.001), and overall, more understandable (mean 86.40±18.07 vs 73.70±20.82, p<0.001). Those with a bachelor’s degree and below preferred the GPT-simplified report in higher proportion (59.6%, 95% CI 52.0-67.0%) of cases.
Conclusions
This study suggests that operative reports simplified by AI can facilitate patient understanding. However, preferences varied according to patient demographics, indicating the need for individualized approaches to simplification. Further research is necessary to optimize the use of AI for personalized patient education and to evaluate the long-term impact on healthcare outcomes.}

Children's voice and communication abilities evolve with age, necessitating tailored protocols for accurate analysis. Distinct vocal properties and communication styles across developmental stages require specific tasks. The absence of standardized pediatric protocols impedes reliable voice data collection, limits robust acoustic measurements, and hinders AI-driven voice research. This study aims to develop age-specific voice data collection protocols, creating a pediatric voice database to advance research and enhance AI applications.
Methods
Protocols were developed iteratively over six months through a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional team involving speech-language pathologists and otolaryngologists. A comprehensive literature review was completed. Emphasis was placed on designing protocols capable of generating high-quality, consistent data for AI modeling while minimizing measurement variability.
Results
Four developmentally appropriate protocols were created for children aged 2 to <4 years, 4 to <6 years, 6 to <10 years, and 10+ years respectively. Each protocol targeted key acoustic parameters while aligning with the linguistic and cognitive abilities of the respective age group. The iterative design incorporated tasks that engaged children while ensuring clinically robust data collection. Standardized protocols were deployed via a user-friendly iPad application, using child-sized headset microphones at fixed distances from the mouth. The protocols were administered to 100 pediatric patients in an otolaryngology clinic between the ages of 2–18.
Conclusions
The development of age specific protocols aims to standardize the collection of pediatric voice and acoustic sound data, which will serve as a valuable resource for advancing artificial intelligence applications within clinical sciences. Future validation will ensure feasibility, adherence, and reliability of data collection to support AI-driven innovations.}

AI technologies, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), enable the efficient analysis of vast datasets, facilitate faster identification of drug targets, optimization of compounds, and prediction of clinical outcomes. This review explores the multifaceted applications of AI across various stages of cancer drug development, from early-stage discovery to clinical trial design, development. In early-stage discovery, AI-driven methods support target identification, virtual screening (VS), and molecular docking, offering precise predictions that streamline the identification of promising compounds. Additionally, AI is instrumental in de novo drug design and lead optimization, where algorithms can generate novel molecular structures and optimize their properties to enhance drug efficacy and safety profiles. Preclinical development benefits from AI's predictive modeling capabilities, particularly in assessing a drug's toxicity through in silico simulations. AI also plays a pivotal role in biomarker discovery, enabling the identification of specific molecular signatures that can inform patient stratification and personalized treatment approaches. In clinical development, AI optimizes trial design by leveraging real-world data (RWD), improving patient selection, and reducing the time required to bring new drugs to market. Despite its transformative potential, challenges remain, including issues related to data quality, model interpretability, and regulatory hurdles. Addressing these limitations is critical for fully realizing AI's potential in cancer drug discovery and development. As AI continues to evolve, its integration with other technologies, such as genomics and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), holds promise for advancing personalized cancer therapies.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasing being deployed across various sectors in society. While bringing progress and promise to scientific discovery, public administration, healthcare, transportation and human well-being generally, artificial intelligence can also exacerbate existing forms of human vulnerabilities and can introduce new vulnerabilities through the interplay of AI inferences, predictions and content that is generated. This underpins the anxiety of policymakers in terms of managing potential harms and vulnerabilities and the harried landscape of governance and regulatory modalities, including through the European Union’s effort to be the first in the world to comprehensively regulate AI. This article examines the adequacy of the existing theories of human vulnerability in countering the challenges posed by artificial intelligence, including through how vulnerability is theorised and addressed within human rights law and within existing legislative efforts such as the EU AI Act. Vulnerability is an element that informs the contours of groups and populations that are protected, for example under non-discrimination law and privacy law. A critical evaluation notes that while human vulnerability is taken into account in governing and regulating AI systems, the vulnerability lens that informs legal responses is one that is particularistic, static and identifiable. In other words, the law demands that vulnerabilities are known in advance in order for meaningful parameters of protection to be designed around them. The individual, as the subject of legal protection, is also expected to be able to identify the harms suffered and therein seek for accountability. However, AI can displace this straightforward framing and the legal certainty that implicitly underpins how vulnerabilities are dealt with under the law. Through data-driven inferential insights of predictive AI systems and content generation enabled by general purpose AI models, novel forms of dynamic, unforeseeable and emergent forms of vulnerability can arise that cannot be adequately encompassed within existing legal responses. Instead, it requires an expansion of not only the types of legal responses offered but also of vulnerability theory itself and the measures of resilience that should be taken to address the exacerbation of existing vulnerabilities and but also of emergent ones. The article offers a re-theorisation of human vulnerability in the age of AI as one informed by the universalist idea of vulnerability theorised by Martha Fineman. A new conceptual framework is offered, through an expanded understanding that sketches out the human condition in this age as one of ‘algorithmic vulnerability.’ It finds support for this new condition through a vector of convergence from the growing vocabularies of harm, the regulatory direction and drawing from scholarship on emerging vulnerabilities. The article proposes the framework of multi-level resilience to account for existing and emerging vulnerabilities. It offers a typology, examining how resilience towards vulnerabilities can be operationalised at the level of the individual, through technological design and within regulatory initiatives and other measures that promote societal resilience. The article also addresses objections to this new framing, namely in terms of how it seemingly results in a problem with no agency, potentially negating fault ascription and blame. Further, it addresses if the re-conception itself falls into the trap of technological determinism and finally, how the universalist notion of vulnerability can seemingly negate human autonomy that is a key feature of human dignity.}

Following a systematic literature review based on PRISMA guidelines, the study examines the role of AI in optimizing mechanical refining, dewatering and drying, friction reduction, and condition monitoring. Results show that AI can fine-tune operational parameters in mechanical refining, leading to energy savings of up to 15 %. In dewatering and drying, AI-driven strategies improve heat recovery efficiency, potentially reducing energy consumption by 10–20 %. In friction management, AI-based optimization and the application of advanced technologies such as aerostatic bearings can reduce energy losses by up to 24 % in the long term.

abstract = {Background
In medical education, particularly in anatomy and dermatology, generative artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to create customized illustrations. However, the underrepresentation of darker skin tones in medical textbooks and elsewhere, which serve as training data for AI, poses a significant challenge in ensuring diverse and inclusive educational materials.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the extent of skin tone diversity in AI-generated medical images and to test whether the representation of skin tones can be improved by modifying AI prompts to better reflect the demographic makeup of the US population.
Methods
In total, 2 standard AI models (Dall-E [OpenAI] and Midjourney [Midjourney Inc]) each generated 100 images of people with psoriasis. In addition, a custom model was developed that incorporated a prompt injection aimed at “forcing” the AI (Dall-E 3) to reflect the skin tone distribution of the US population according to the 2012 American National Election Survey. This custom model generated another set of 100 images. The skin tones in these images were assessed by 3 researchers using the New Immigrant Survey skin tone scale, with the median value representing each image. A chi-square goodness of fit analysis compared the skin tone distributions from each set of images to that of the US population.
Results
The standard AI models (Dalle-3 and Midjourney) demonstrated a significant difference between the expected skin tones of the US population and the observed tones in the generated images (P<.001). Both standard AI models overrepresented lighter skin. Conversely, the custom model with the modified prompt yielded a distribution of skin tones that closely matched the expected demographic representation, showing no significant difference (P=.04).
Conclusions
This study reveals a notable bias in AI-generated medical images, predominantly underrepresenting darker skin tones. This bias can be effectively addressed by modifying AI prompts to incorporate real-life demographic distributions. The findings emphasize the need for conscious efforts in AI development to ensure diverse and representative outputs, particularly in educational and medical contexts. Users of generative AI tools should be aware that these biases exist, and that similar tendencies may also exist in other types of generative AI (eg, large language models) and in other characteristics (eg, sex, gender, culture, and ethnicity). Injecting demographic data into AI prompts may effectively counteract these biases, ensuring a more accurate representation of the general population.}

This study investigates the influence of AI-based technologies on creating safe and respectful work atmospheres, focusing on their role in fostering safety, inclusion, and ethical management practices. Drawing on recent findings, the paper explores the dual nature of AI's effects, from enabling safer workplaces to posing ethical challenges. (1) The study identifies critical dynamics within AI-driven work environments. Through safety-oriented tools,—such as real-time risk monitoring systems,—AI contributes to incident prevention and fosters inclusion. However, its implementation also introduces challenges, particularly regarding privacy concerns and lack of transparency, which may trigger distrust and raise ethical dilemmas among employees. (2) The analysis further emphasizes ethical and operational barriers. To ensure effective integration, organisations must address the psychological impact of automation, ensuring it does not compromise employee morale or workplace cohesion. Transparent implementation practices are essential to avoid unintended negative consequences. (3) Findings reveal opportunities for AI to reshape organisational culture by harmonising operational efficiency with inclusive values. The study underscores the importance of aligning technological innovation with strategies that prioritise ethical governance and employee well-being. To support these insights, the study adopts a bibliographic analysis methodology, reviewing a curated corpus of peer-reviewed publications from the past five years. Sources were selected based on thematic relevance, scientific rigour, and empirical depth. This method enabled the identification of conceptual patterns, gaps in the literature, and key trends regarding the socio-ethical implications of AI in the workplace. These insights offer practical guidelines for organisations implementing AI technologies. By adopting transparent communication, ethical frameworks, and strategies aligned with employee well-being, businesses can leverage AI to create safer and more inclusive environments. This research underscores the importance of designing policies that balance technological advancement with respect for employee rights and privacy.}

This review addresses the need for effective governance by synthesising the fragmented landscape of AI governance approaches. Using bibliometric analysis and an in-depth literature review, it maps and classifies governance approaches to develop a hybrid, iterative and integrated AI governance model. The literature analysis reveals four primary categories that govern AI: formal, informal, risk management, and eclectic. The findings are used to embed these approaches directly into the different phases of the AI lifecycle, adapted from CRISP-DM and CDAC AI lifecycles. Furthermore, grounded in Ostrom’s polycentric governance theory, the study proposes ‘The Wheel of AI Governance’ (WAG) model to align governance actions with distinct phases of the AI lifecycle. It offers proper checkpoints to AI developers, project managers, policymakers and organisations to design, direct the development, assess the deployment, regulate the societal integration and advocate changes through constant monitoring of the AI applications. The paper concludes with policy recommendations that focus not just on technical soundness but also on ethical alignment, legal compliance, participatory co-creation, and the good of the community. The WAG model emphasises local agency, adaptive governance and sustainability while governing AI, particularly for less industrialised nations.}

This concept merges servitization —integrating services with products— and digitization —enhancing operations through digital technologies. While previous research has examined digital servitization and smart technologies, a gap remains in understanding how Artificial Intelligence (AI) specifically supports various types of digital servitization across both back-office and front-office activities. This study addresses this gap by investigating how AI enhances digital servitization through six case studies of companies implementing AI-driven servitized solutions. Adopting a capability theoretical perspective, we analyze the application of AI in both back-office and front-office activities for the delivery of base, intermediate, and advanced services. Our findings reveal that AI's role varies by service type, affecting customer interactions and operational tasks differently. We present a theoretical framework with five propositions that elucidate how AI capabilities enhance digital servitization. This framework gives scholars a refined understanding of AI's roles beyond the generalized black box approach and offers practitioners practical insights on leveraging AI for digital transformation.}

Intensive care units (ICUs) are at the forefront of this movement, given their unique combination of high data density, decision-making under uncertainty, and the vulnerability of critically ill patients. Yet despite the abundance of proof-of-concept studies, the clinical translation of AI tools remains strikingly limited, with fewer than 2 % of published algorithms prospectively evaluated in real-world ICU settings. In this editorial, we discuss the roadmap proposed by Workum et al., which outlines a progressive, risk-aligned framework for the integration of AI in critical care. Beyond model performance, the authors emphasize fundamental values such as fairness, explainability, and accountability, while highlighting the practical challenges of data interoperability, infrastructure, governance, and liability. Their work reminds us that AI adoption is not primarily hindered by algorithms themselves but by the surrounding ecosystem of data quality, regulatory clarity, and clinician trust. We argue that the true promise of AI in the ICU lies not in rapid technological breakthroughs but in careful, evidence-based, and human-centered implementation. Whether these systems will ultimately improve patient-centered outcomes remains uncertain. The roadmap by Workum et al. should therefore be read as a call for cautious progress: to begin with low-risk applications, to invest in infrastructure and interdisciplinary collaboration, and to rigorously evaluate clinical benefit before moving toward high-stakes medical decision support.}

The model utilized Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) regression methods to correlate spectral and colorimetric data with elemental composition. Replicas were prepared and painted with three red inorganic pigments (cinnabar, hematite and minium), and they were analysed using portable X-ray fluorescence, visible reflectance spectroscopy, and digital imaging. Cross-reference between elemental and colorimetric information was performed using Support Vector Regression and Artificial Neural Networks, and the models were validated through Venetian-blinds cross-validation. In the calibration step, Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) for Fe, Pb, and Hg were 0.03, 3.5, and 3.0 %, respectively, with correlation values (R2) of 0.99, 0.90, and 0.94.

While research has begun mapping AI's role in digital media ecosystems, an often-overlooked factor is public attitudes toward regulating AI in election campaigns. Understanding these attitudes is essential as regulatory debates unfold at national and international levels, where public opinion often constrains the leeway of political decision-makers. We analyze data from two cross-sectional surveys conducted in the United States and Taiwan—two democracies with relatively lenient campaign regulations, which held presidential elections in the same year. We examine the role of general attitudes toward AI, psychological dispositions, and partisan alignments in shaping public support for AI regulation during elections.

This study aims to compare student-generated nursing care plans with ChatGPT-generated care planning texts for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery.
Background
Given the increasing significance of technology in nursing education, the integration of AI-driven tools into educational methodologies demonstrates potential for enhancing nursing students' preparation for clinical practice by providing access to more comprehensive and current information sources.
Methods
This descriptive comparative study evaluated 14 nursing care plans developed by nursing students for laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients alongside care plans generated by ChatGPT for identical patient scenarios, using the DISCERN scale as the assessment instrument.
Results
The quality of student-generated care plans was determined to be satisfactory, whereas the quality of ChatGPT-generated texts was assessed as moderate. Both student care plans and ChatGPT-generated texts demonstrated moderate reliability and information quality regarding nursing care. Students exhibited the highest accuracy rate in formulating correct nursing diagnoses (90.22 %), while ChatGPT-generated texts demonstrated superior performance in correctly establishing nursing goals (90.35 %) and developing appropriate nursing interventions (91.07 %).
Conclusions
The findings indicate that while student-generated care plans demonstrated generally acceptable quality, ChatGPT's performance in this domain was moderate, particularly in formulating surgical nursing goals and interventions. Although clinical outcomes were not evaluated in this study, the results suggest that ChatGPT may serve as a valuable supplementary resource for surgical nursing education and care plan development. Further research is warranted to determine its impact on patient care quality and clinical effectiveness.}

Intraoral photographs served as the primary data source, with fluorescent and microscopic dental images excluded. The methodological characteristics and performance metrics of clinical studies reporting on AI models were analysed. Twenty-six studies met the review criteria. Various image acquisition devices were used by the resarchers including professional cameras, intraoral cameras, smartphones, and home-use devices. Ten studies used clinical examinations as reference methods, while 16 used visual examinations. Eight studies involved multiple experts in dataset annotation. Only 9 studies employed multiple intraoral views for their AI models, with the remaining studies focusing solely on the frontal view. Regarding AI tasks, 17 studies used classification, 4 used detection, and 5 used segmentations. Performance metrics varied widely and were assessed at multiple levels. Classification studies showed accuracies ranging from 0.46 to 1.00, detection studies showed accuracies from 0.56 to 0.78, and segmentation studies achieved Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 0.43 to 0.70. AI models show potential for detecting periodontal disease from intraoral photographs, but their clinical use faces challenges. Future research should focus on improving reporting standards, standardising evaluation metrics, performing external tests, enhancing data quality, and using clinical gold standards as reference methods. Furthermore, efforts should focus on promoting transparency, integrating ethical considerations, minimising misclassification, and advancing the development of explainable and user-friendly AI systems to enhance their clinical applicability and reliability.}

We illustrate the application of our proposal to a time series of Bitcoin prices, which acts as the response variable, along with time series of classical financial prices, which act as explanatory variables. Three main findings emerge from the analysis. First, recurrent neural networks lead to a better performance, in terms of accuracy and robustness, with respect to classic neural networks. Second, the best performing models indicate that Bitcoin prices are affected mostly by their lagged values, and that their explainability, in terms of classical financial assets, is limited.

abstract = {Objectives
Congenital heart diseases (CHD) are a significant cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Detecting these abnormalities during pregnancy increases survival rates, enhances prognosis, and improves pregnancy management and quality of life for the affected families. Foetal echocardiography can be considered an accurate method for detecting CHDs. However, the detection of CHDs can be limited by factors such as the sonographer's skill, expertise and patient specific variables. Using artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to address these challenges, increasing antenatal CHD detection during prenatal care. A scoping review was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect databases, employing keywords, Boolean operators, and inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify peer-reviewed studies. Thematic mapping and synthesis of the found literature were conducted to review key concepts, research methods and findings.
Key findings
A total of n = 233 articles were identified, after exclusion criteria, the focus was narrowed to n = 7 that met the inclusion criteria. Themes in the literature identified the potential of AI to assist clinicians and trainees, alongside emerging new ethical limitations in ultrasound imaging.
Conclusion
AI-based tools in ultrasound imaging offer great potential in assisting sonographers and doctors with decision-making in CHD diagnosis. However, due to the paucity of data and small sample sizes, further research and technological advancements are needed to improve reliability and integrate AI into routine clinical practice.
Implications for practice
This scoping review identified the reported accuracy and limitations of AI-based tools within foetal cardiac ultrasound imaging. AI has the potential to aid in reducing missed diagnoses, enhance training, and improve pregnancy management. There is a need to understand and address the ethical and legal considerations involved with this new paradigm in imaging.}

In this paper, we revised and expanded upon the TTT; by including a new stage of assessment (i.e. testing simulated conversations) and providing further guidance on the phases of the TTT. First, the CA is tested in a safe environment with simulated clients (with Gen AI), instead of human clients; second, the TTT is conducted with a selected sample of actual users; and third, the TTT is conducted with a large sample of users. Adopting this innovative assessment method will guide the future development of mental health CAs, ensuring AI-led interventions meet the rigorous standards expected of human therapists.}

The advent of digital twins in pharmacology presents transformative potential for precision medicine, enabling personalized treatment optimization through dynamic computational simulations of drug interactions at molecular, cellular, and patient levels. These advanced virtual replicas of a patient's biological system are designed to predict individual therapeutic responses with high fidelity, thereby moving beyond the one-size-fits-all paradigm. This paper explores the concept of digital pharmacological twins, detailing how they can integrate heterogeneous data, including multi-omic, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, clinical, and environmental information, and employing a synergy of advanced mechanistic and machine learning models. Using illustrative examples from ongoing international initiatives, this work highlights the methodological frameworks necessary for developing and validating such comprehensive predictive tools. We underscore the critical importance of model interoperability, robust data integration strategies, and rigorous validation to ensure clinical utility.

By combining multi-omics data researchers learn more about the genetic and molecular basis of important agricultural traits. However, statistical methods are often insufficient to address the data complexity. By contrast, AI techniques, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), are emerging as powerful tools to explore complexity. Algorithms such as random forests (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) can support genomic selection (GS) and trait value prediction. Furthermore, DL models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM) dominate high-throughput phenotyping and time series analyses, providing accurate predictions for crop yield, disease resistance, and genotype adaptation. Large language models (LLMs) are able to integrate complex omics data. AI models can analyze large dataset, generated by genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomic applications because algorithms can combine different inputs, such as DNA sequences, gene expression profiles, protein–protein interaction networks, metabolite concentrations, and phenotypic data under specific environmental conditions. The integration of individual models can improve prediction accuracy by reducing resource inputs and automating labor-intensive tasks involved in breeding programs.

abstract = {Background and Objectives
AI has emerged as a transformative force in clinical medicine, changing the diagnosis, treatment, and management of patients. Tools have been derived for working with ML, DL, and NLP algorithms to analyze large complex medical datasets with unprecedented accuracy and speed, thereby improving diagnostic precision, treatment personalization, and patient care outcomes. For example, CNNs have dramatically improved the accuracy of medical imaging diagnoses, and NLP algorithms have greatly helped extract insights from unstructured data, including EHRs. However, there are still numerous challenges that face AI integration into clinical workflows, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, ethical dilemmas, and problems with the interpretability of “black-box” AI models. These barriers have thus far prevented the widespread application of AI in health care, and its possible trends, obstacles, and future implications are necessary to be systematically explored. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to assess the current trends in AI applications in clinical medicine, identify those obstacles that are hindering adoption, and identify possible future directions. This research hopes to synthesize evidence from other peer-reviewed articles to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role that AI plays to advance clinical practices, improve patient outcomes, or enhance decision-making.
Methods
A systematic review was done according to the PRISMA guidelines to explore the integration of Artificial Intelligence in clinical medicine, including trends, challenges, and future directions. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles from 2014 to 2024 with keywords such as “Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,” “AI in Clinical Practice,” “Machine Learning in Healthcare,” and “Ethical Implications of AI in Medicine.” Studies focusing on AI application in diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient care reporting measurable clinical outcomes were included. Non-clinical AI applications and articles published before 2014 were excluded. Selected studies were screened for relevance, and then their quality was critically appraised to synthesize data reliably and rigorously.
Results
This systematic review includes the findings of 8 studies that pointed out the transformational role of AI in clinical medicine. AI tools, such as CNNs, had diagnostic accuracy more than the traditional methods, particularly in radiology and pathology. Predictive models efficiently supported risk stratification, early disease detection, and personalized medicine. Despite these improvements, significant hurdles, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, and resistance from clinicians regarding the “black-box” nature of AI, had yet to be surmounted. XAI has emerged as an attractive solution that offers the promise to enhance interpretability and trust. As a whole, AI appeared promising in enhancing diagnostics, treatment personalization, and clinical workflows by dealing with systemic inefficiencies.
Conclusion
The transformation potential of AI in clinical medicine can transform diagnostics, treatment strategies, and efficiency. Overcoming obstacles such as concerns about data privacy, the danger of algorithmic bias, and difficulties with interpretability may pave the way for broader use and facilitate improvement in patient outcomes while transforming clinical workflows to bring sustainability into healthcare delivery.}

This includes early detection from electronic health records, electrocardiography and imaging, automated, standardized interpretation of echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) potentially expediting referral and final diagnosis. Deep learning applied to echocardiography achieves expert-level PAH classification and provides automated right-heart quantification while CT/CMR-based models segment the heart and great vessels, quantify lung disease radiomics, and infer hemodynamics, supporting noninvasive triage and prognostication. In future, remote monitoring with wearables and telemedicine, coupled with AI analytics, promises to enable proactive management and potentially reduce hospitalizations. While early studies are promising, translation to practice requires rigorous external validation, prospective studies, bias auditing and seamless integration into guideline-aligned workflows. Overall, AI stands to augment expert clinical judgement by converting high-dimensional, multimodal data into actionable insights. With careful governance and evidence generation, AI has the potential to shorten time-to-diagnosis, refine risk stratification, and personalize therapy in PAH, ultimately improving outcomes for this high-risk population.}

Statement of problem
Despite advances in artificial intelligence (AI), the quality, reliability, and understandability of health-related information provided by chatbots is still a question mark. Furthermore, studies on maxillofacial prosthesis (MP) information from AI chatbots are lacking.
Purpose
The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the reliability, quality, readability, and similarity of responses to MP-related questions generated by 4 different chatbots.
Material and methods
A total of 15 questions were provided by a maxillofacial prosthodontist and from 4 different chatbots (ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3). The Reliability Scoring (adapted DISCERN), the Global Quality Scale (GQS), the Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES), the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Grade Level (FKRGL), and the Similarity Index (iThenticate) were used to evaluate the performance of chatbots. Data were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the differences between chatbots were determined by the Conover multiple comparison test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction (α=.05).
Results
There were no significant differences between the chatbots' DISCERN scores, except for one question where ChatGPT showed significantly higher reliability than Gemini or Copilot (P=.03). There was no statistically significant difference among AI tools in terms of GQS values (P=.096), FRES values (P=.166), and FKRGL values (P=.247). The similarity rate of Gemini was statistically higher than other AI chatbots (P=.03).
Conclusions
ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3 showed good quality responses. All chatbots' responses were difficult for non-professionals to read and understand. Low similarity rates were found for all chatbots except Gemini, indicating originality of their information.}

In August 2024–January 2025, we asked Snapchat AI questions related to delta-8, a derived intoxicating cannabis product that has been rapidly rising in popularity in the United States and has limited regulations. Qualitative responses were independently coded into thematic categories.
Results
The AI prompted individuals to ask follow-up questions, which largely drove the themes. Themes included general information (similarity to delta-9 THC, but with a purported lower potency; relaxing/euphoric effects; legality), use motives (pain relief, anti-nausea, appetite stimulation, anxiety reduction), potential consequences (dry mouth, red eyes, increased heart rate, drowsiness, contaminated products, inaccurate labeling), retail availability, and product recommendations. Responses did not provide supporting citations. While the AI did not block results related to delta-8, it did block results pertaining to “weed” and “THC.”
Discussion
Snapchat AI is a plausible information source about delta-8 THC among youth. No citations were provided to support claims made by the AI, which portrayed delta-8 THC use favorably, as having benefits and low risks from use. Findings have policy implications, including restricting or regulating this type of content—particularly relating to claims without supporting scientific evidence.}

A productive conversation about AI requires the conversation to recognize AI as a very broad and diverse field with “narrow” and “general” applications. Narrow AI applications are quite common and widely deployed today. A fearless conversation can be had regarding how narrow AI can be more widely adopted while allowing for increased transparency and comfort. General AI is more complex and generally leads to what level of government regulation may be necessary (if practically possible).

It analyses the definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum technologies (QTs) that have been adopted by 27 EU member states and two associated countries (Norway and the United Kingdom), and which are contained in their national strategy documents. Drawing on the theoretical framework of sociotechnical imaginaries and employing qualitative thematic analysis, the article shows how these definitions co-constitute narratives that intertwine visions of technological development with governance choices. The lexicon used in definitions is not neutral, and reflects distinct epistemological assumptions and political priorities, thus demonstrating how definitional language acts as a performative tool that legitimizes strategic decisions and aligns collective expectations. AI and QTs are emerging technologies (ETs), characterized by rapid growth, high uncertainty, and potential for significant socio-economic impact, and they are the only two ETs for which most European countries have produced national strategic documents in response to specific requests and coordination efforts by the European Commission. A comparative thematic analysis reveals the relevance of these definitions for national and supranational governance, and indicates that the strategic documents are explicitly oriented toward imagining and shaping specific technological futures that justify increasing public investment in both domains.}

Physicians are asked to make decisions on a daily basis without complete certainty, whether it is in understanding the patient’s problem, performing the physical examination, interpreting the findings of diagnostic tests, or proposing a management plan. The reasons for this uncertainty are widespread, including the lack of knowledge about the patient, individual physician limitations, and the limited predictive power of objective diagnostic tools. This uncertainty poses significant problems in providing competent patient care. Research efforts and teaching are attempts to reduce uncertainty that have now become inherent to medicine. Despite this, uncertainty is rampant. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, which are being rapidly developed and integrated into practice, may change the way we navigate uncertainty. In their strongest forms, AI tools may have the ability to improve data collection on diseases, patient beliefs, values, and preferences, thereby allowing more time for physician-patient communication. By using methods not previously considered, these tools hold the potential to reduce the uncertainty in medicine, such as those arising due to the lack of clinical information and provider skill and bias. Despite this possibility, there has been considerable resistance to the implementation of AI tools in medical practice. In this viewpoint article, we discuss the impact of AI on medical uncertainty and discuss practical approaches to teaching the use of AI tools in medical schools and residency training programs, including AI ethics, real-world skills, and technological aptitude.}

This review outlines recent progress in leveraging these computational methodologies to enhance device performance across domains such as dynamic light modulation, antenna design, and nonlinear optical phenomena. We systematically survey advancements in AI-driven forward and inverse design strategies, which bypass conventional trial-and-error approaches by embedding physical laws directly into optimization workflows. Furthermore, the integration of AI accelerates electromagnetic simulations and enables precise modelling of complex optical effects, including topological photonic states and nonlinear interactions. A comparative evaluation of algorithmic frameworks highlights their strengths in balancing computational efficiency, multi-objective optimization, and fabrication feasibility. Challenges such as limited interpretability of AI models and data scarcity for unconventional optical modes are critically addressed. Finally, we emphasize future opportunities in scalable multi-physics modelling, adaptive architectures, and practical deployment of AI-optimized photonic devices.

abstract = {Background
While artificial intelligence has significantly impacted medicine, the application of large language models (LLMs) in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) remains underexplored.
Purpose
This study aimed to measure and compare the accuracy of 4 leading LLMs on OMS board examination questions and to identify specific areas for improvement.
Study Design, Setting, and Sample
An in-silico cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate 4 artificial intelligence chatbots on 714 OMS board examination questions.
Predictor Variable
The predictor variable was the LLM used — LLM 1 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 4o [GPT-4o], OpenAI, San Francisco, CA), LLM 2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3.5 [GPT-3.5], OpenAI, San Francisco, CA), LLM 3 (Gemini, Google, Mountain View, CA), and LLM 4 (Copilot, Microsoft, Redmond, WA).
Main Outcome Variables
The primary outcome variable was accuracy, defined as the percentage of correct answers provided by each LLM. Secondary outcomes included the LLMs' ability to correct errors on subsequent attempts and their performance across 11 specific OMS subject domains: medicine and anesthesia, dentoalveolar and implant surgery, maxillofacial trauma, maxillofacial infections, maxillofacial pathology, salivary glands, oncology, maxillofacial reconstruction, temporomandibular joint anatomy and pathology, craniofacial and clefts, and orthognathic surgery.
Covariates
No additional covariates were considered.
Analyses
Statistical analysis included one-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) to compare performance across chatbots. χ2 tests were used to assess response consistency and error correction, with statistical significance set at P < .05.
Results
LLM 1 achieved the highest accuracy with an average score of 83.69%, statistically significantly outperforming LLM 3 (66.85%, P = .002), LLM 2 (64.83%, P = .001), and LLM 4 (62.18%, P < .001). Across the 11 OMS subject domains, LLM 1 consistently had the highest accuracy rates. LLM 1 also corrected 98.2% of errors, while LLM 2 corrected 93.44%, both statistically significantly higher than LLM 4 (29.26%) and LLM 3 (70.71%) (P < .001).
Conclusion and Relevance
LLM 1 (GPT-4o) significantly outperformed other models in both accuracy and error correction, indicating its strong potential as a tool for enhancing OMS education. However, the variability in performance across different domains highlights the need for ongoing refinement and continued evaluation to integrate these LLMs more effectively into the OMS field.}

abstract = {Background
Tobacco use remains a significant global health challenge, contributing substantially to preventable morbidity and mortality. Despite established interventions, outcomes vary due to scalability issues, resource constraints, and limited reach.
Objective
To systematically explore current artificial intelligence (AI) applications within tobacco control, highlighting their usefulness, benefits, limitations, and ethical implications.
Method
This scoping review followed the Arksey and O’Malley framework and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Five major databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and PsycINFO) were searched for articles published between January 2010 and March 2025. From 1,172 initial records, 57 studies met inclusion criteria after screening.
Results
AI-driven tools, including machine learning and natural language processing, effectively monitor social media for emerging tobacco trends and personalize smoking cessation interventions. Applications were predominantly focused on predictive modelling (using algorithms like XGBoost and SVM to predict e-cigarette use and relapse risk), cessation support (employing chatbots and reinforcement learning to improve accessibility), and social media surveillance (detecting synthetic nicotine promotions and analysing vaping trends). Approximately 22% of studies aligned with WHO FCTC Article 13 (tobacco advertising regulation), while 45% supported Article 14 (cessation services). However, tobacco industry interference remains a critical challenge, with AI technologies exploited to undermine public health initiatives, target vulnerable populations, and manipulate policy discussions. Critical issues including algorithmic bias, privacy concerns, interpretability challenges, and data quality must be addressed to ensure positive impact.
Conclusion
AI holds considerable promise for extending tobacco control if implemented ethically, transparently, and collaboratively. Future directions emphasize explainable AI development, integration of real-time intervention systems, global data inclusion, and robust cross-sector collaboration. While the current landscape shows a laudable start, it reflects the need for more diverse skill sets to fully harness AI’s extensive prospects for tobacco control and achieving tobacco endgame goals.}

abstract = {Background
Positive images of aging in traditional media promote better health outcomes in older adults, including increased life expectancy. Images produced by generative artifical intelligence (AI) technologies may reflect and amplify societal age-related biases, a phenomenon known as digital ageism. This study addresses a gap in research on the perpetuation of digital ageism in AI-generated images over time.
Objective
This study examined how visual characteristics of digital ageism in AI-generated representations of older adults changed over time. It aims to provide insight into the interplay between technology advancements, societal attitudes toward aging, and the well-being of older adults interacting with digital media.
Methods
This longitudinal study compared 164 images generated by Open AI’s DALL-E 2 at 2 time points, 1 year apart (2022 and 2023). Identical text prompts from the geriatric lexicon (eg, frail older adult, dementia) were used at both time points. Authors evaluated the images generated for demographic characteristics (perceived gender, race, and socioeconomic status), and primary emotion characteristics, then compared the frequency of these characteristics between years and evaluation characteristics using a type III 2-way ANOVA.
Results
Representations of White-racialized older adults were 5-fold higher than those of other races in both years. The mean number of representations of Asian-racialized individuals increased from 20 to 31 (P=.004), and the mean number of other racialized representations also increased, from 6 to 14 (P=.007). Representations of people with a middle-class socioeconomic status were significantly more frequent than other statuses in 2022 and 2023 with no changes in socioeconomic status from one year to the next. Prompts were largely neutral for expression terms, while image analyses for expressions did not show significant differences in positive, neutral, or negative emotions between 2022 and 2023. Prompts used for image generation had more male-oriented terms than expected, and male representation was higher then female representation in the images, with no difference in sex representation between the 2 time points.
Conclusions
Despite a social emphasis on positive views on aging, AI text-to-image generators persistently generated images with characteristics of digital ageism. Images predominantly featured White-racialized individuals at both time points, with no improvement in emotional representation despite using neutral text prompts. These findings highlight the persistence of ageist visual characteristics in AI-generated images over time. A limitation of this study is that it focused only on AI image generation and did not analyze other AI-generated content that may express digital ageism.}

ML approaches have shown promise in predicting the functional impact of genetic variants and establishing genotype–phenotype correlations, exemplified by tools like “Hema-Class” for factor VIII variants. However, some challenges remain, including the need to expand variant selection beyond missense mutations (which is now the standard of most studies).

In this frame, we discuss various AI/ML-based tools for genetic variant detection and interpretation, highlighting their strengths and limitations.

This perception gap is partly explained by individuals’ tendency to attribute lower effort and creativity to work produced by AI algorithms. Through two pre-registered experiments, we investigate how individuals evaluate creative content when it is labeled as created by AI, humans, or human-AI collaboration. While previous research has established algorithm aversion across various domains, our findings reveal nuanced patterns in creative contexts. Individuals consistently rate content labeled as AI-authored as less creative and less favorable compared to content labeled as human-authored. This effect is driven by a sequential mediation: perceived effort influences perceived creativity, which in turn shapes overall attitudes. Importantly, content labeled as human-AI collaboration performs significantly better than AI-only content, suggesting a potential mitigation strategy. Our main theoretical contribution is the identification of the machine heuristic (MH), individuals' preexisting beliefs about AI capabilities, as a key moderator. Individuals with stronger MH beliefs attribute more effort to AI-generated work, which positively influences perceptions of creativity along with behavioral intentions. Using Netflix show descriptions as stimuli, we show these effects extend beyond attitudes to impact behavioral outcomes like willingness to watch. These results expand algorithm aversion theory by establishing MH as an important boundary condition and highlighting human-AI collaboration as an effective mitigation approach, offering valuable insights for creative industries integrating AI while maintaining positive perceptions among users.}

abstract = {Summary
Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping infectious disease diagnostics by supporting clinical decision making, optimising laboratory and clinical workflows, and enabling real-time disease surveillance. AI approaches improve pathogen detection, antimicrobial stewardship, and treatment monitoring, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. The role of AI in combating antimicrobial resistance is particularly significant, enabling rapid pathogen identification and personalised treatment. Despite progress over the past two decades, widespread AI adoption in infectious disease diagnostics faces challenges. In high-income countries, fragmented data ecosystems, incomplete datasets, and algorithmic bias hinder clinical integration. Meanwhile, low-income and middle-income countries contend with limited digital infrastructure, unstandardised data, and financial constraints, exacerbating disparities in diagnostic access. Further barriers include concerns over interoperability, data privacy, cybersecurity, and the regulation of AI implementation. This paper examines the role of AI in infectious disease diagnostics, highlighting both opportunities and limitations. It underscores the need for coordinated investments in digital infrastructure, harmonised data-sharing frameworks, and clinician engagement to support equitable, sustainable adoption. Addressing these challenges will enable health-care systems to harness the potential of AI to improve infectious disease detection, prevention, and management of infectious diseases, thereby strengthening global health resilience.}

abstract = {Purpose
Accurate evaluation of anterior chamber depth (ACD), a major risk factor for angle closure, is clinically important. Although standard techniques provide reliable measurements, they are often labor-intensive, technically demanding, and time-consuming. To address this, we previously developed an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm capable of estimating ACD from slit lamp photographs. This study sought to assess the performance of this AI model when applied via the Smart Eye Camera (SEC), a smartphone-compatible slit lamp imaging system, by comparing its estimates to those obtained with anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT) at a separate institution.
Design
An evaluation of diagnostic test.
Participants
Five hundred fifty-six phakic eyes (268 nondilated and 288 dilated eyes) from 329 Asian patients.
Methods
A retrospective analysis was performed on images captured using both the SEC and AS-OCT. Anterior chamber depth values generated by the AI model embedded in the SEC were compared with corresponding measurements obtained using AS-OCT.
Main Outcome Measures
Metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), were calculated to evaluate model performance.
Results
The AI algorithm integrated into the SEC demonstrated the capability to estimate the ACD with an MAE of 0.119 ± 0.0949 mm and an MSE of 0.0233 ± 0.0557 mm. A strong correlation was observed between ACD measurements obtained using AS-OCT and those estimated by AI (R = 0.922; 95% confidence interval, 0.908–0.933). The ICC for agreement between AI-estimated and AS-OCT-measured ACD was 0.903, indicating excellent reliability.
Conclusions
Our AI model, embedded within the SEC platform, demonstrated high accuracy in estimating ACD when benchmarked against AS-OCT. Given its portability and user-friendliness, the SEC presents a promising option for accessible ACD screening across diverse clinical environments.

For the safety of SFR internal structures, although it is a crucial inspection for defect monitoring, it is difficult to identify structural defects because of the invisible environment. Therefore, we applied the YOLOv7 model in this study; however, we encountered challenges including decreased accuracy with complex defect shapes and complications from data augmentation during pre-training. To solve these problems, we additionally applied the enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network for higher resolution and a Sobel noise-filtering algorithm to enhance the defect detection accuracy. And we evaluated our system by comparing it with a confidence score. This underscores the effectiveness of the approach in enhancing the defect detection capabilities.

abstract = {Background
Blood and plasma volume calculations are a daily part of practice for many Transfusion Medicine and Apheresis practitioners. Though many formulas exist, each facility may have their own modifications to consider. ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) provides a new and exciting pathway for those with no programming experience to create personalized programs to meet the demands of daily practice. Additionally, this pathway creates computer programs that provide accurate and reproducible outputs. Herein, we aimed to create a step-by-step process for clinicians to create customized computer programs for use in everyday practice.
Methods
We created a process of inputs to ChatGPT-40, which generated computer programming code. This code was copied and pasted into Notepad (and saved as a Python file) and Google Colaboratory to verify functionality. We validated the durability of our process by repeating it over a 5-day timeframe and by recruiting volunteers to reproduce our outputs using the suggested process.
Results
Computer code generated by ChatGPT-40 in response to our common language inputs was accurate and durable over time. The code was fully functional in both Python and Colaboratory. Volunteers reproduced our process and outputs with minimal assistance.
Conclusion
We analyzed the practical application of ChatGPT-40 and artificial intelligence (AI) to perform daily calculations encountered in Transfusion Medicine. Our results provide a proof of concept that people with no programming experience can create customizable solutions for their own facilities. Our future work will expand to the creation of comprehensive and customizable websites designed for each individual user.}
