abstract = {Background
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant health concern, contributing to the highest mortality among infectious diseases worldwide. However, none of the various TB diagnostic tools introduced is deemed sufficient on its own for the diagnostic pathway, so various artificial intelligence (AI)–based methods have been developed to address this issue.
Objective
We aimed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of AI-based algorithms for TB detection across various data modalities.
Methods
Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) 2020 guidelines, we conducted a systematic review to synthesize current knowledge on this topic. Our search across 3 major databases (Scopus, PubMed, Association for Computing Machinery [ACM] Digital Library) yielded 1146 records, of which we included 152 (13.3%) studies in our analysis. QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2) was performed for the risk-of-bias assessment of all included studies.
Results
Radiographic biomarkers (n=129, 84.9%) and deep learning (DL; n=122, 80.3%) approaches were predominantly used, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-16 (n=37, 24.3%), ResNet-50 (n=33, 21.7%), and DenseNet-121 (n=19, 12.5%) architectures being the most common DL approach. The majority of studies focused on model development (n=143, 94.1%) and used a single modality approach (n=141, 92.8%). AI methods demonstrated good performance in all studies: mean accuracy=91.93% (SD 8.10%, 95% CI 90.52%-93.33%; median 93.59%, IQR 88.33%-98.32%), mean area under the curve (AUC)=93.48% (SD 7.51%, 95% CI 91.90%-95.06%; median 95.28%, IQR 91%-99%), mean sensitivity=92.77% (SD 7.48%, 95% CI 91.38%-94.15%; median 94.05% IQR 89%-98.87%), and mean specificity=92.39% (SD 9.4%, 95% CI 90.30%-94.49%; median 95.38%, IQR 89.42%-99.19%). AI performance across different biomarker types showed mean accuracies of 92.45% (SD 7.83%), 89.03% (SD 8.49%), and 84.21% (SD 0%); mean AUCs of 94.47% (SD 7.32%), 88.45% (SD 8.33%), and 88.61% (SD 5.9%); mean sensitivities of 93.8% (SD 6.27%), 88.41% (SD 10.24%), and 93% (SD 0%); and mean specificities of 94.2% (SD 6.63%), 85.89% (SD 14.66%), and 95% (SD 0%) for radiographic, molecular/biochemical, and physiological types, respectively. AI performance across various reference standards showed mean accuracies of 91.44% (SD 7.3%), 93.16% (SD 6.44%), and 88.98% (SD 9.77%); mean AUCs of 90.95% (SD 7.58%), 94.89% (SD 5.18%), and 92.61% (SD 6.01%); mean sensitivities of 91.76% (SD 7.02%), 93.73% (SD 6.67%), and 91.34% (SD 7.71%); and mean specificities of 86.56% (SD 12.8%), 93.69% (SD 8.45%), and 92.7% (SD 6.54%) for bacteriological, human reader, and combined reference standards, respectively. The transfer learning (TL) approach showed increasing popularity (n=89, 58.6%). Notably, only 1 (0.7%) study conducted domain-shift analysis for TB detection.
Conclusions
Findings from this review underscore the considerable promise of AI-based methods in the realm of TB detection. Future research endeavors should prioritize conducting domain-shift analyses to better simulate real-world scenarios in TB detection.

abstract = {The development of an efficient disease detection system for Nile Tilapia is critical due to the significant economic and food security impacts of disease outbreaks. Traditional disease identification methods are labor-intensive, inefficient, and often fail to detect early signs of disease, leading to substantial economic losses. This study introduces the Adaptive Artificial Multiple Intelligence Fusion System (A-AMIFS), an advanced model that innovatively combines image augmentation, ensemble image segmentation methods, and ensemble Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. The system utilizes a non-population-based artificial multiple intelligence system (np-AMIS) for optimizing image augmentation and a population-based system (Pop-AMIS) for decision fusion, demonstrating superior performance. Evaluated on two novel datasets, Nile Tilapia Disease-1 (NTD-1) and Nile Tilapia Disease-2 (NTD-2), the system achieved an overall accuracy of 98.26 %, precision of 98.35 %, recall of 98.30 %, and an F1-score of 98.32 %, significantly outperforming existing methodologies. Additionally, a "chatbot" feature was developed to enable farmers to automatically detect fish diseases using the ensemble model as the backend classification system, achieving an impressive classification accuracy of over 98 %. These results underscore the system's robustness in detecting various diseases in Nile Tilapia and its potential to transform disease detection in aquaculture. The proposed system reduces manual labor, optimizes disease identification processes, and enhances disease management strategies, promoting more sustainable and productive aquaculture practices. This research highlights the indispensable role of AI techniques in overcoming the complex challenges of disease detection and management in aquaculture, presenting efficient and effective disease management practices. By leveraging advanced image augmentation, ensemble segmentation methods, and ensemble CNN architectures, this study presents a revolutionary approach to disease detection in Nile Tilapia. The integration of a user-friendly chatbot interface further enhances the technology's accessibility and practical application, empowering farmers to proactively manage disease outbreaks and mitigate economic losses.}

abstract = {Objective
Pain is a complex sensory and emotional experience that significantly impacts individuals' well-being. Lumbar radicular pain (LRP) is a prevalent neuropathic pain affecting 9.9% to 25% of the population annually. Accurate identification of pain patterns in LRP is essential for diagnosis and management. Artificial intelligence has potential in health care but faces challenges in reliability and accuracy. This study aimed to investigate the accuracy and consistency of LRP patterns demonstrated by ChatGPT-4o.
Methods
The study was conducted at Üsküdar State Hospital from June 1 to June 30, 2024, utilizing the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), version 4o language model. ChatGPT-4o was prompted to generate and mark LRP patterns for L4, L5, and S1 radiculopathies on an anatomical model. The process was repeated after two weeks to assess consistency. The markings by ChatGPT were compared with those by two experienced specialists using OpenCV for analysis.
Results
ChatGPT's initial and follow-up markings of L4, L5, and S1 radiculopathy pain patterns were statistically significantly different from each other and from the specialists' markings (P < 0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions
ChatGPT currently lacks the capacity to accurately and consistently represent LRP patterns. AI tools in health care require further refinement, validation, and regulation to ensure reliability and safety. Future research should involve multiple AI platforms and broader medical conditions to enhance generalizability.}

abstract = {In the fabrication and monitoring of parts in composite structures, which are being used more and more in a variety of engineering applications, the prediction and fatigue failure detection in composite materials is a difficult problem. This difficulty arises from several factors, such as the lack of a comprehensive investigation of the fatigue failure phenomena, the lack of a well-defined fatigue damage theory used for fatigue damage prediction, and the inhomogeneity of composites because of their multiple internal borders. This study investigates the fatigue behavior of carbon fiber reinforced with epoxy (CFRE) laminated composite plates under spectrum loading utilizing a unique Deep Learning Network consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN). The method includes establishing Finite Element Model (FEM) in a plate model under a spectrum fatigue loading. Then, a CNN is trained for fatigue behavior prediction. The training phase produces promising results, showing the model’s performance with 94.21% accuracy, 92.63% regression, and 91.55% F-score. To evaluate the model’s reliability, a comparison is made between fatigue data from the CNN and the FEM. It was found that the error band for this comparison is less than 0.3878 MPa, affirming the accuracy and reliability of the proposed technique. The proposed method results converge with available experimental results in the literature, thus, the study suggests the broad applicability of this method to other different composite structures.}

A three-stage AI-based data generating strategy is suggested to handle missing datasets, using a small sample dataset obtained from a smart healthcare program community in a specific city: Step one involves generating the dataset's basic attributes using a tree-based generation strategy that takes the original data distribution into account. Step two involves using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create basic indicators of behavioural capability assessment for the samples. Step three builds on stage two and uses a multivariate linear regression method to create evaluation criteria and indicators of high-level behavioural capability. Six problems involving multiple classifications and two tasks using multiple labels are implemented using various neural network-based training strategies on the obtained data to assess the usefulness of the dataset for downstream tasks. To ensure that the data collected is genuine and useful, the experimental data must be analysed and expert knowledge must be included.}

This study aimed to develop a prediction tool to identify abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) at increased risk of rupture incorporating demographic, clinical, imaging, and medication data using artificial intelligence (AI).
Design
A development and validation study for individual prognosis using AI in a case-control design.
Methods
From two Danish hospitals, all available ruptured AAA cases between January 2009 and December 2016 were included in a ratio of 1:2 with elective surgery controls. Cases with previous AAA surgery or missing preoperative scans were excluded. Features from computed tomography angiography scans and hospital records were manually retrieved. The sample was divided randomly and evenly into developmental and internal validation groups. A SHapley Additive exPlanations Feature Importance Rank Ensembling (SHAPFire) AI tool was developed using a gradient boosting decision tree framework. The final SHAPFire AI model was compared with models using (1) solely infrarenal anterior-posterior diameter and (2) all available features.
Results
The study included 637 individuals (84.8% men, mean age 73 ± 7 years, 213 ruptured AAAs). The SHAPFire AI incorporated 20 of 68 available features, and aneurysm size, blood pressure, and relationships between height and weight were given highest rankings. The receiver operating characteristic curve for the SHAPFire AI model displayed a significant increase in accuracy identifying ruptured AAA cases compared with the conventional model based solely on diameter with areas under the curves of 0.86 ± 0.04 and 0.74 ± 0.03 (P = .008), respectively. SHAPFire AI was comparable in performance with the model using all features.
Conclusions
This study successfully developed a SHAPFire AI tool to identify AAAs at increased risk of rupture with significantly higher accuracy than diameter alone. External validation of the model is warranted before clinical implementation.}

abstract = {Colonoscopy, a crucial procedure for detecting and removing colorectal polyps, has seen transformative advancements through the integration of artificial intelligence, specifically in computer-aided detection (CADe) and diagnosis (CADx). These tools enhance real-time detection and characterization of lesions, potentially reducing human error, and standardizing the quality of colonoscopy across endoscopists. CADe has proven effective in increasing adenoma detection rate, potentially reducing long-term colorectal cancer incidence. However, CADe’s benefits are accompanied by challenges, such as potentially longer procedure times, increased non-neoplastic polyp resections, and a higher surveillance burden. CADx, although promising in differentiating neoplastic and non-neoplastic diminutive polyps, encounters limitations in accuracy, particularly in the proximal colon. Real-world data also revealed gaps between trial efficacy and practical outcomes, emphasizing the need for further research in uncontrolled settings. Moreover, CADx limited specificity and binary output underscore the necessity for explainable artificial intelligence to gain endoscopists' trust. This review aimed to explore the benefits, harms, and limitations of artificial intelligence for colon cancer screening, surveillance, and treatment focusing on CADe and CADx systems for lesion detection and characterization, respectively, while addressing challenges in integrating these technologies into clinical practice.}

abstract = {Conventional fault diagnosis systems have constrained the automotive industry to damage vehicle maintenance and component longevity critically. Hence, there is a growing demand for advanced fault diagnosis technologies to mitigate the impact of these limitations on unplanned vehicular downtime caused by unanticipated vehicle breakdowns. Due to vehicles’ increasingly complex and autonomous nature, there is a growing urgency to investigate novel diagnosis methodologies for improving safety, reliability, and maintainability. While Artificial Intelligence (AI) has provided a great opportunity in this area, a systematic review of the feasibility and application of AI for Vehicle Fault Diagnosis (VFD) systems is unavailable. Therefore, this review brings new insights into the potential of AI in VFD methodologies and offers a broad analysis using multiple techniques. We focus on reviewing relevant literature in the field of machine learning as well as deep learning algorithms for fault diagnosis in engines, lifting systems (suspensions and tires), gearboxes, and brakes, among other vehicular subsystems. We then delve into some examples of the use of AI in fault diagnosis and maintenance for electric vehicles and autonomous cars. The review elucidates the transformation of VFD systems that consequently increase accuracy, economization, and prediction in most vehicular sub-systems due to AI applications. Indeed, the limited performance of systems based on only one of these AI techniques is likely to be addressed by combinations: The integration shows that a single technique or method fails its expectations, which can lead to more reliable and versatile diagnostic support. By synthesizing current information and distinguishing forthcoming patterns, this work aims to accelerate advancement in smart automotive innovations, conforming with the requests of Industry 4.0 and adding to the progression of more secure, more dependable vehicles. The findings underscored the necessity for cross-disciplinary cooperation and examined the total potential of AI in vehicle default analysis.}

In a first longitudinal experiment with full-time employees in the UK (N = 174), participants interacting with AI to solve a task (compared to a control group) experienced increased perceived control over their future work self when FWSS was high, in contrast to those with low FWSS. We replicated this pattern in a second longitudinal study with German business students (N = 208). Building on these findings, a third longitudinal experiment with German full-time employees (N = 155) extended the model by demonstrating a moderated mediation: for individuals with high FWSS, AI interaction increased perceived control over the future work self and thus promoted proactive career behavior. In contrast, perceived control and proactive career behavior decreased for those with low FWSS. This research demonstrates the potential impact of AI interactions on work-related outcomes, offering critical insights for both theory and practice.}

Active phase control compensates for phase noise-induced coherence degradation by directly or indirectly detecting phase differences among sub-beams. Traditional phase control algorithms face challenges in large-scale CBC systems due to low control bandwidth. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, integrating advanced intelligent algorithms into active phase control systems holds promise for enhancing the performance of CBC systems. This paper begins with a brief introduction to the principles of traditional phase control algorithms, such as Stochastic Parallel Gradient Descent (SPGD) and locking of optical coherence by single-detector electronic-frequency tagging (LOCSET), elucidating why AI can assist in active phase control systems. Subsequently, we review recent advancements in phase control based on deep learning and reinforcement learning, concluding with a summary and future outlook. As phase control technology advances, the integration of AI and traditional algorithms will play a pivotal role in achieving high-bandwidth and accurate phase control in large-scale CBC systems.}

abstract = {Introduction
Pain associated with temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) is often confused with odontogenic pain, which is a challenge in endodontic diagnosis. Validated screening questionnaires can aid in the identification and differentiation of the source of pain. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a virtual assistant based on artificial intelligence using natural language processing techniques to automate the initial screening of patients with tooth pain.
Methods
The PAINe chatbot was developed in Python (Python Software Foundation, Beaverton, OR) language using the PyCharm (JetBrains, Prague, Czech Republic) environment and the openai library to integrate the ChatGPT 4 API (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA) and the Streamlit library (Snowflake Inc, San Francisco, CA) for interface construction. The validated TMD Pain Screener questionnaire and 1 question regarding the current pain intensity were integrated into the chatbot to perform the differential diagnosis of TMD in patients with tooth pain. The accuracy of the responses was evaluated in 50 random scenarios to compare the chatbot with the validated questionnaire. The kappa coefficient was calculated to assess the agreement level between the chatbot responses and the validated questionnaire.
Results
The chatbot achieved an accuracy rate of 86% and a substantial level of agreement (κ = 0.70). Most responses were clear and provided adequate information about the diagnosis.
Conclusions
The implementation of a virtual assistant using natural language processing based on large language models for initial differential diagnosis screening of patients with tooth pain demonstrated substantial agreement between validated questionnaires and the chatbot. This approach emerges as a practical and efficient option for screening these patients.}

abstract = {Background
Obesity, now the fifth leading global cause of death, has seen a dramatic rise in prevalence over the last forty years. It significantly increases the risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Early identification of obesity risk allows for preventative actions against obesity-related factors. Despite the existence of AI-based predictive models, developing a comprehensive obesity screening tool requires extensive cohort data.
Methods
A thorough review of 6,351 articles, focusing on AI predictions for obesity in cohort studies, was conducted up to March 2024 across databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science.
Results
Using the JBI checklist, 10 studies involving 411,580 participants were critically appraised. These cohorts varied in length and size, with half lasting 1–5 years and involving less than 5,000 participants. The data types were categorized into nine groups, with demographic (7 studies) and biomarker data (4 studies) being the most frequently used. Machine learning was predominantly used (95 % of studies), mostly employing supervised learning techniques. Algorithms like random forest (RF) (18 %), linear regression (18 %), and stochastic gradient boosting (GBM) (14 %) were common. Top-performing models were noted for k-means (accuracy of 0.977), artificial neural networks (AUC of 0.99), GBM (specificity of 0.95 and sensitivity of 0.65), RF (RMSE of 0.146), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (r-squared of 0.684).
Conclusion
Findings indicate that AI algorithms can predict obesity; however, further research is needed to assess their effectiveness in analyzing obesity-related data and examine most advanced AI methods. This review is a valuable resource for dietitians and researchers engaged in developing predictive models and intelligent clinical decision support systems using AI technology.}

This development is enabled by an increase in computing power, a decrease in its price, and the emergence of ubiquitous computing, resulting in vast amounts of storable and processable data. However, the diffusion of AI depends on its legitimacy in society, whereby legitimacy is understood as the congruence between organizational activities and their cultural environment. This study aims at understanding the process whereby AI is being (de)legitimated across key industries and over time. To capture and trace the process of legitimation, we rely on media coverage as a form of societal discourse reflecting the legitimation process of AI. We find that the legitimation process gathers momentum in the mid-2010s and the legitimacy of AI increases over time. Furthermore, we identify four types of legitimacy discourse, which integrate sentiment, specific media frames, and appeals of persuasion. Uncovering the four types of legitimacy discourse, we aim at supporting organizations seeking to understand the legitimacy of specific AI applications and how these legitimacy judgments can shift.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence-based X-ray image detection can significantly aid early tuberculosis (TB) detection. However, the varying distribution of X-ray image data across different hospitals has resulted in a decline in the model’s performance when transitioning to a new dataset. Domain adaptation techniques can effectively mitigate the impact of this issue. However, current domain adaptation methods align the entire image features between the source and target domains without explicitly focusing on regions containing transferable classification information across domains. Forced alignment of features across the entire image may lead to negative transfer. This paper proposes a complementary domain attention model (CDAM) for TB detection where the feature map is partitioned into domain-shared (DSH) and domain-specific (DSP) features. DSP features are complementary to DSH features. DSH features are responsible for mitigating the impact of domain gaps on classification. Consequently, they focus on areas containing classification information that can be transferred across domains. In contrast, the role of the DSP feature is to maximize the domain gap, concentrating its attention on areas rich in domain information. Given that the DSH and DSP features are complementary, when the DSP feature occupies domain-informative areas, it simultaneously encourages the DSH feature to focus more accurately on areas containing transferable classification information across domains, thereby enhancing classification performance. The objective of CDAM is to fully consider the importance of different regions within the feature map and mitigate negative transfer. The proposed method underwent domain adaptation experiments on the Shenzhen, Montgomery, and TBX11K datasets, achieving average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity scores of 73.3%, 74.0%, and 72.7%, respectively. This result surpasses existing domain adaptation methods for TB data, providing evidence for the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {Identifying host defense peptides (HDPs) that are effective against drug-resistant infections is challenging due to their vast sequence space. Artificial intelligence (AI)-guided design can accelerate HDP discovery, but it traditionally requires large data sets to operationalize. We report an AI workflow that utilizes limited data sets (∼100 peptides) to uncover potent, selective, and safe HDPs by informing selection through lead candidate mutational scanning. This approach, referred to as Lead Informed Machine Interrogation of Therapeutic Sequences (LIMITS), is applied against the exemplary pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Experimental validation of predicted sequences shows nearly an order of magnitude improvement in potency, selectivity, and safety, relative to the initial template. Post hoc analysis suggests sequence length may be a unique and underappreciated driver of antitubercular HDP activity. These results demonstrate that, with continued development, the LIMITS approach can identify selective HDPs under data-limited conditions and elucidate structure–function–performance relationships previously hidden in biologic complexity.

AI-driven DR classification frameworks typically consist of sequential stages: image preprocessing, optic disc (OD) localization and removal, blood vessel segmentation, feature extraction, and classification of DR severity. In the proposed and implemented model, each of these phases was systematically addressed to ensure improved performance. The implementation demonstrated superior accuracy, achieving 98.02 % on the widely used MESSIDOR dataset. The pipeline incorporated effective preprocessing to enhance image quality, accurate OD localization and exclusion to avoid false detections, followed by precise vessel segmentation. Extracted features were then used to train deep learning models for DR severity classification. Comparative analysis with existing methods executed on the same dataset revealed that proposed model outperformed other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. Ww outline the recent progress in AI-based DR screening, highlighting the significance of each diagnostic phase and their role in improving overall performance. By evaluating multiple approaches and benchmarking them against established dataset, the study emphasizes the transformative role of AI in DR diagnosis.

abstract = {Summary
Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in health care have been effective in many areas of medicine, but they are often trained for a single task using labelled data, making deployment and generalisability challenging. How well a general-purpose AI language model performs diagnosis and triage relative to physicians and laypeople is not well understood.
Methods
We compared the predictive accuracy of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3)'s diagnostic and triage ability for 48 validated synthetic case vignettes (<50 words; sixth-grade reading level or below) of both common (eg, viral illness) and severe (eg, heart attack) conditions to a nationally representative sample of 5000 lay people from the USA who could use the internet to find the correct options and 21 practising physicians at Harvard Medical School. There were 12 vignettes for each of four triage categories: emergent, within one day, within 1 week, and self-care. The correct diagnosis and triage category (ie, ground truth) for each vignette was determined by two general internists at Harvard Medical School. For each vignette, human respondents and GPT-3 were prompted to list diagnoses in order of likelihood, and the vignette was marked as correct if the ground-truth diagnosis was in the top three of the listed diagnoses. For triage accuracy, we examined whether the human respondents’ and GPT-3's selected triage was exactly correct according to the four triage categories, or matched a dichotomised triage variable (emergent or within 1 day vs within 1 week or self-care). We estimated GPT-3's diagnostic and triage confidence on a given vignette using a modified bootstrap resampling procedure, and examined how well calibrated GPT-3's confidence was by computing calibration curves and Brier scores. We also performed subgroup analysis by case acuity, and an error analysis for triage advice to characterise how its advice might affect patients using this tool to decide if they should seek medical care immediately.
Findings
Among all cases, GPT-3 replied with the correct diagnosis in its top three for 88% (42/48, 95% CI 75–94) of cases, compared with 54% (2700/5000, 53–55) for lay individuals (p<0.0001) and 96% (637/666, 94–97) for physicians (p=0·012). GPT-3 triaged 70% correct (34/48, 57–82) versus 74% (3706/5000, 73–75; p=0.60) for lay individuals and 91% (608/666, 89–93%; p<0.0001) for physicians. As measured by the Brier score, GPT-3 confidence in its top prediction was reasonably well calibrated for diagnosis (Brier score=0·18) and triage (Brier score=0·22). We observed an inverse relationship between case acuity and GPT-3 accuracy (p<0·0001) with a fitted trend line of –8·33% decrease in accuracy for every level of increase in case acuity. For triage error analysis, GPT-3 deprioritised truly emergent cases in seven instances.
Interpretation
A general-purpose AI language model without any content-specific training could perform diagnosis at levels close to, but below, physicians and better than lay individuals. We found that GPT-3's performance was inferior to physicians for triage, sometimes by a large margin, and its performance was closer to that of lay individuals. Although the diagnostic performance of GPT-3 was comparable to physicians, it was significantly better than a typical person using a search engine.

Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising solutions for automating the diagnosis and management of corneal conditions. This narrative review examines the application of AI in corneal diseases, focusing on keratoconus, infectious keratitis, pterygium, dry eye disease, Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy, and corneal transplantation. AI models integrating diverse imaging modalities (e.g., corneal topography, slit-lamp, and anterior segment OCT images) and clinical data have demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, often outperforming human experts. Emerging trends include the incorporation of biomechanical data to enhance keratoconus detection, leveraging in vivo confocal microscopy for diagnosing infectious keratitis, and employing multimodal approaches for comprehensive disease analysis. Additionally, AI has shown potential in predicting disease progression, treatment outcomes, and postoperative complications in corneal transplantation. While challenges remain such as population heterogeneity, limited external validation, and the “black box” nature of some models, ongoing advancement in explainable AI, data augmentation, and improved regulatory frameworks can serve to address these limitations.}

Prior research on hospitality communication has not solved this issue, as AI-generated images are occasionally promoted as effective marketing tools across various service contexts, while other scholars caution against their use due to the significant concerns they may trigger among consumers. Following a mixed-methods approach to find boundary conditions, our research reveals that consumers prefer hospitality services advertised with real images, rather than those featuring AI-generated images. Nevertheless, this effect is moderated by two key factors. In particular, the research reveals that the negative influence of using generative AI images on intentions to use and recommend the service are strengthened for hedonic rather than utilitarian services, and for highly rather than lowly involved customers. A qualitative study further explores the reasons behind this rejection, highlighting that customers perceive companies using AI-generated images as impersonal, less professional, lacking credibility, and potentially misleading, as they impede customers’ ability to envision the actual experience. Implications for management suggest that, while generative AI holds promise for enhancing communication, companies should use AI-generated images with caution. The discussion also proposes future research directions to explore the broader implications of AI use in marketing.}

However, their detection remains challenging even for experienced pathologists. While artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated SRC diagnosis has gained increasing attention for its potential to enhance diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, existing methodologies lack systematic review. This gap impedes the assessment of disparities between algorithmic capabilities and clinical applicability. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AI-driven SRC analysis from 2008 through June 2025. We systematically summarize the biological characteristics of SRCs and challenges in their automated identification. Representative algorithms are analyzed and categorized as unimodal or multi-modal approaches. Unimodal algorithms, encompassing image, omics, and text data, are reviewed; image-based ones are further subdivided into classification, detection, segmentation, and foundation model tasks. Multi-modal algorithms integrate two or more data modalities (images, omics, and text). Finally, by evaluating current methodological performance against clinical assistance requirements, we discuss unresolved challenges and future research directions in SRC analysis. This survey aims to assist researchers, particularly those without medical backgrounds, in understanding the landscape of SRC analysis and the prospects for intelligent diagnosis, thereby accelerating the translation of computational algorithms into clinical practice.}

Given the advanced capabilities of new AI systems, it is critical that these are embedded using standard operational procedures, clear epistemic criteria, and behave in alignment with the normative expectations of society. Scholars in multiple domains have subsequently begun to conceptualize the different forms that AI applications may take, highlighting both their potential benefits and pitfalls. However, the literature remains fragmented, with researchers in social science disciplines like public administration and political science, and the fast-moving fields of AI, ML, and robotics, all developing concepts in relative isolation. Although there are calls to formalize the emerging study of AI in government, a balanced account that captures the full depth of theoretical perspectives needed to understand the consequences of embedding AI into a public sector context is lacking. Here, we unify efforts across social and technical disciplines by first conducting an integrative literature review to identify and cluster 69 key terms that frequently co-occur in the multidisciplinary study of AI. We then build on the results of this bibliometric analysis to propose three new multifaceted concepts for understanding and analysing AI-based systems for government (AI-GOV) in a more unified way: (1) operational fitness, (2) epistemic alignment, and (3) normative divergence. Finally, we put these concepts to work by using them as dimensions in a conceptual typology of AI-GOV and connecting each with emerging AI technical measurement standards to encourage operationalization, foster cross-disciplinary dialogue, and stimulate debate among those aiming to rethink government with AI.}

The results show that the “sense of identification” and “sense of control” will cause people to have emotional dependence on the artificial intelligence chatbots, with p < 0.05. However, the psychological distance plays a regulating role in the identification-emotional dependence and the sense of control-emotional dependence, respectively.

abstract = {Sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains a pressing health issue, affecting hundreds of thousands each year globally. The heterogeneity among people who suffer a SCD, ranging from individuals with severe heart failure to seemingly healthy individuals, poses a significant challenge for effective risk assessment. Conventional risk stratification, which primarily relies on left ventricular ejection fraction, has resulted in only modest efficacy of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for SCD prevention. In response, artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise for personalized SCD risk prediction and tailoring preventive strategies to the unique profiles of individual patients. Machine and deep learning algorithms have the capability to learn intricate nonlinear patterns between complex data and defined end points, and leverage these to identify subtle indicators and predictors of SCD that may not be apparent through traditional statistical analysis. However, despite the potential of AI to improve SCD risk stratification, there are important limitations that need to be addressed. We aim to provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art of AI prediction models for SCD, highlight the opportunities for these models in clinical practice, and identify the key challenges hindering widespread adoption.}

keywords = {Artificial intelligence, Education, Research, Osteopathic medicine},
abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into healthcare education and research, yet little is known about how AI is perceived within osteopathy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cross-sectional study to examine AI perspectives specifically among osteopathic educators and researchers, providing fresh insights into technology adoption within this healthcare discipline.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted between December 2023 and February 2024 among osteopathic educators and/or researchers through snowball sampling. The survey collected data on AI-related knowledge, usage in educational and research contexts, attitudes toward AI, perceived risks, and necessities challenges. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to validate the structure of the survey. Demographic factors such as age, gender, occupation, and academic qualifications were analysed in relation to scores.
Results
190 respondents from 18 countries completed the survey. Participants demonstrated positive attitudes toward the role of AI in education and research, but acknowledged limited proficiency in its use. Usage of AI was higher among younger, male participants, with AI primarily used for personal organisation and research. Concerns about AI included risks of bias, over-reliance on technology, and potential replacement of human judgment. Participants with educational roles expressed fewer concerns about AI's risks compared to those outside of education. Knowledge of AI was not correlated with demographic factors, but attitudes and concerns about risks varied with age.
Conclusion
Osteopathic educators and researchers view AI as a beneficial tool for teaching and research, but face challenges in its effective implementation due to concerns about technology replacing human expertise and biases. Training, institutional support, and ethical guidelines are essential to foster the responsible integration of AI in osteopathy.
Implications for practice
●AI is underutilised in osteopathic education and research despite positive attitudes towards its potential.●Educators are less concerned about AI risks, positioning them as key facilitators of responsible assimilation.●Institutional policies should provide clear AI usage guidelines while addressing ethical and validity concerns.●AI should support, not replace, human expertise, ensuring critical thinking remains central in education and research.}

In fact, it promises to master and coordinate the immense pool of information acquired so far about chemical reactions (about 100 million data), so that optimization of process parameters and prediction of process performance will be by far more effective than they are today. In other words, problems, which ordinarily require years of work by highly qualified chemical engineers could be solved in minutes. How to synthesize a given chemical compound from available reagents; what will happen as a result of the reaction mixing given chemical compounds under specific conditions; under what conditions a given reaction should be carried out; how to design a chemical reactor; what the reactor conditions are and how to optimize it to achieve the best economics? This issue concerns AI—a combination of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). ML uses algorithms to analyze data, learn from it, and make informed decisions based on gained knowledge. Instead, DL creates an “artificial neural network” that can independently learn and make intelligent decisions. In addition, the development of AI technologies has led to the creation of robotic chemists (RS), which can synthesize compounds of interest on their own. In this case, the AI serves as the cognitive brain, and the robot acts as a physical body, providing autonomous operation.}

The research uses the TVP-SV-VAR methodology to recognise the ever-changing correlation among the artificial intelligence index (AII), global supply chain pressure indicator (GSCPI) and global energy-related uncertainty index (GEUI). In light of quantitative discussions, it is presented that AII exerts negative influences on GSCPI and GEUI, highlighting that the development of artificial intelligence would facilitate global supply chain stability and energy sustainability; in turn, GSCPI and GEUI have positive and adverse influences on AII. Through comparing, the correlation between AII and GEUI is only reflected in the short term, whereas the interrelationship between AII and GSCPI could be observed in the short-, medium- and long-run situations. In addition, GSCPI exerts positive and negative influences on GEUI in the short, medium and long runs, whereas the positive effects of GEUI on GSCPI means the uncertainty in the energy market might destroy the supply chain across the globe. In the context of a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, this study will provide significant recommendations to maintain global supply chain stability and energy sustainability by applying artificial intelligence technology.}

We develop and demonstrate a method, called the Conceptual Modeling for Machine Learning (CMML), which is comprised of guidelines for data preparation in machine learning and based on conceptual modeling constructs and principles. To assess the impact of CMML on machine learning outcomes, we first applied it to two real-world problems to evaluate its impact on model performance. We then solicited an assessment by data scientists on the applicability of the method. These results demonstrate the value of CMML for improving machine learning outcomes.}

With recent advances in modern technologies, AI interventions have provided more personalized and adaptive features tailored to meet a diverse range of health conditions and eating behaviors. However, given the increasing attention of researchers and practitioners to design AI interventions that promote healthy eating behaviors, there is a need to synthesize knowledge to empirically justify their effectiveness and ethical implications. While AI interventions continue to raise ethical concerns around privacy, transparency, autonomy, and other related ones, this could potentially impact the overall effectiveness of these interventions in the healthy eating domain. Hence, in this book chapter, we present results from a systematic review of articles published from 2013 to 24. Results from our review show that while 77% have shown the effectiveness of AI interventions in this domain, there are several limitations, including no follow-up studies and ethical considerations that need to be addressed to conclude on their long-term effectiveness.

Numerous research efforts are currently focused on detecting pelvic fractures using advanced intelligent processes. Although these methods have shown impressive accuracy, they frequently result in extended processing times. To address this challenge, we propose a model that integrates three key components of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to enhance the speed of fracture detection. The first component is an explainable segment that pinpoints the location of fractures. The second component is a deep generative approach that carefully analyzes images to simplify feature complexity. The final component is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which assists in decision-making by introducing four transfer learning models: InceptionV2, Xception, MobileNet, and MobileNetV2. Among these, the MobileNet-based approach demonstrates the highest accuracy in classifying conditions, achieving an accuracy of 93.43%, a precision of 99.47%, a sensitivity of 99.38%, and an F1 score of 99.42%, based on a dataset of 876 images. These results are surprising, as the model consistently performed exceptionally well in detecting pelvic fractures. This finding is significant because the model consistently showcased superior performance in identifying pelvic fractures. Moreover, the overall performance of the proposed XAI is comparable to that of medical professionals and orthopedic specialists in detecting pelvic fractures. The proposed technique may offer a promising solution to the challenges in pelvic fracture identification. It harnesses the strengths of deep generative models and CNNs to deliver accurate and interpretable results.}

This study investigates customers’ perceptions and adoption intentions regarding personalized solutions provided by AI or humans. Drawing from stereotyping theory, mind perception theory, and uniqueness theory, this study establishes a serial mediation model, with provider type (AI versus human) as the independent variable, expected group size and perceived uniqueness of solutions as serial mediators, and perceived similarity to others as a moderator. Customer attitude and adoption intention serve as the dependent variables. Based on two online scenario experiments, we collected 533 valid responses from participants in China (N = 262) and the United States (N = 271). The results indicate that customers tend to perceive AI-generated solutions as less unique, compared to those provided by humans, and consequently exhibit less favorable attitudes and lower adoption intentions. Furthermore, the expected large group size associated with AI-generated solutions serves as an underlying psychological mechanism that negatively affects customers’ perception of uniqueness. Especially when customers perceive themselves as dissimilar to typical users of AI, they are more likely to infer that AI cannot autonomously deliver personalized solutions, and therefore may share their information with others, resulting in a larger expected group size. These findings contribute to the literature on AI-generated content, uniqueness perception, and information adoption, while also offering practical implications for businesses seeking to more effectively leverage AI tools in delivering personalized solutions.}

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers a powerful avenue for peptide design, yet this process remains challenging due to vast sequence space, complex structure-activity relationships, and the need to balance antimicrobial potency with low toxicity. Here, we introduce AMP-Diffusion, a latent diffusion model fine-tuned on antimicrobial peptide (AMP) sequences using embeddings from protein language models (pLMs). AMP-Diffusion enables the rapid discovery of antibiotic candidates by systematically exploring sequence space. We generated 50,000 candidate sequences, filtered and ranked them using our APEX deep learning (DL) model, and synthesized 46 top candidates. These peptides showed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, including against multidrug-resistant strains, while exhibiting low cytotoxicity. Mechanistic studies revealed membrane permeabilization and depolarization as primary modes of action. In a preclinical mouse model, lead peptides reduced bacterial loads with efficacy comparable to polymyxin B and levofloxacin, with no detectable adverse effects. AMP-Diffusion thus presents a robust platform for designing antibiotics.}

Specimen Mammography (SM) is commonly used in Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS) for intraoperative margin analysis. A systematic scoping review was conducted to identify sources of methodological variation in Specimen Mammography Interpretation (SMI) and assess the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to optimise Diagnostic Accuracy (DA).
Methods
Embase, Pubmed, Cochrane and web of science databases were searched. Studies were included if SM was used for margin analysis for BCS with reported DA compared with pathological margin status and data extracted.
Results
1242 unique studies were identified, of which 40 were included. 39/40 studies did not utilise AI for SMI, with 4 studies comparing 2 relevant techniques, giving 43 non-AI study arms for analysis. There was wide variation in SM techniques, including number of views and location of SM. Specialist performing SMI in usual clinical practice was surgeon (13/39 studies;33 %), radiologist(s) (16/39;41 %), surgeon and radiologist (3/39;8 %) or not stated (7/39;18 %) which differed from the study specialist in 15/39 (38 %) of studies. Diagnostic accuracy in studies ranged from sensitivity 19–91.7 % and specificity 25–100 %.
Conclusions
There is marked variation in current techniques used for SM for intraoperative margin analysis with correspondingly disparate DA. Only 1 study applied AI to SMI, and we identify how AI could optimise SMI and a template for future work to apply AI techniques to SMI, reduce unwarranted variation and optimise DA.}

This impact is particularly notable within the field of materials science and engineering, where artificial intelligence has catalyzed the discovery of new materials, enhanced design simulations, influenced process controls, and facilitated operational analysis and predictions of material properties and behaviors. Consequently, these advancements have streamlined the synthesis, simulation, and processing procedures, leading to material optimization for diverse applications. A key area of interest within materials science is the development of hydrogen-based electrochemical systems, such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, as clean energy solutions, known for their promising high energy density and zero-emission operations. While artificial intelligence shows great potential in studying both fuel cells and electrolyzers, existing literature often separates them, with a clear gap in comprehensive studies on electrolyzers despite their similarities. This review aims to bridge that gap by providing an integrated overview of artificial intelligence's role in both technologies. This review begins by explaining the fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence and introducing commonly used artificial intelligence-based algorithms in a simplified and clearly comprehensible way, establishing a foundational knowledge base for further discussion. Subsequently, it explores the role of artificial intelligence in materials science, highlighting the critical applications and drawing on examples from recent literature to build on the discussion. The paper then examines how artificial intelligence has propelled significant advancements in studying various types of fuel cells and electrolyzers, specifically emphasizing proton exchange membrane (PEM) based systems. It thoroughly explores the artificial intelligence tools and techniques for characterizing, manufacturing, testing, analyzing, and optimizing these systems. Additionally, the review critically evaluates the current research landscape, pinpointing progress and prevailing challenges. Through this thorough analysis, the review underscores the fundamental role of artificial intelligence in advancing the generation and utilization of clean energy, illustrating its transformative potential in this area of research.}

For decades, a key mechanism to ensure QM in radiology practices has been ACR accreditation. However, no such program currently exists for AI in radiology. As leaders of the ACR Commissions on Quality and Safety and Informatics, we are dedicated to establishing ACR accreditation for radiology AI. In this article, we outline our plan for this effort. ACR accreditation is a peer-reviewed process that evaluates radiology practices according to ACR Practice Parameters and Technical Standards, which are consensus-based guidelines aimed at improving care quality and reducing variability. ACR Practice Parameters focus on clinical aspects like patient management, and Technical Standards address the performance of imaging and treatment equipment. To support the development of this accreditation program, the ACR Recognized Center for Healthcare-AI (ARCH-AI) program has been established as a precursor to formal accreditation. ARCH-AI participants attest to meeting minimum criteria in areas such as governance, model selection, acceptance testing, monitoring, and management of locally developed models. Insights gained from ARCH-AI will inform the development of the formal accreditation program, which will culminate in ACR Council approval, currently anticipated in spring 2027. The College remains committed to fostering dialogue among members and stakeholders to ensure AI fulfills its promise of enhancing patient care safely and effectively.}

abstract = {Summary
Objective
To evaluate and compare the performance of OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 and Microsoft Copilot in providing information on 3D-printed orthodontic appliances, with a focus on the accuracy, completeness of the content, and response generation time.
Methods
This cross-sectional study proceeded in five stages. Initially, three orthodontists created a total of 125 questions concerning 3D printed orthodontic appliances of which 105 questions were finalized to be incorporated into the study by a panel of senior orthodontists. These questions were subsequently organized into 15 distinct domains. Both chatbots were presented with the questions under consistent conditions, using the same laptop and internet setup. A stopwatch was used to record response times. The responses were anonymized and evaluated by seven orthodontists with extensive experience, who scored accuracy and completeness based on standardized tools. Through discussion, evaluators reached a consensus on each score, ensuring reliability.
Results
Spearman's correlation revealed a moderate to strong negative correlation between accuracy and completeness for both chatbots (p≤0.001). The negative correlation observed between accuracy and completeness scores, particularly prominent in Copilot, indicates a trade-off between these qualities in some responses. Mann-Whitney U tests confirmed significant differences in accuracy and completeness between the chatbots (p≤0.001), though response time differences were not statistically significant (p=0.204). Cohen's Kappa results implied little to no consistency between the two models on the assessed parameters (p>0.05).
Conclusion
ChatGPT-4 outperformed Microsoft Copilot in accuracy and completeness, providing more precise and comprehensive information on 3D-printed orthodontic appliances demonstrating a greater ability to handle complex, and detailed requests in this area.}

The increasing pressure on product development has led chemical companies to evaluate the stages of the product development process carefully. In product development, preparation and technical analysis are particularly critical. The knowledge and experience gained in the preparation phase can eliminate risky and costly activities in the later stages of the process. In addition, the testing and evaluation phases are critical elements that can provide meaningful feedback before commercialization. Another issue that chemical manufacturers work on, both for new and existing products, is quality control (QC). Manufacturers need to ensure that the product’s quality meets customer expectations. Making QC processes more efficient is one of the issues the industry has been working on for a long time. Therefore, using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in product development and QC has become inevitable. McKinsey asserted that the implementation of AI has the potential to enhance market fit by up to 50%, achieve product performance improvements ranging from 15 to 60%, attain up to 50% increased workplace productivity, and facilitate a reduction in time to market of up to 40%. According to the research conducted by Bain & Company, AI is predicted to result in a 20% reduction in engineering hours and a 5–30% reduction in costs.}

In the digital age, artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated great strengths in design and learning. The application of AI has become an irreversible trend, with particularly remarkable potential for use in crop breeding.

In this review, we explore the fundamental engineering principles used in crop synthetic biology and their applications for crop improvement. We discuss approaches to genetic circuit design, including gene editing, synthetic nucleic acid and protein technologies, multi-omics analysis, genomic selection, directed protein engineering, and AI. We then outline strategies for the development of crops with higher photosynthetic efficiency, reshaped plant architecture, modified metabolic pathways, and improved environmental adaptability and nutrient absorption; the establishment of trait networks; and the construction of crop factories. We propose the development of SMART (self-monitoring, adapted, and responsive technology) crops through AI-empowered synthetic biotechnology.

To address the challenges of high computational resource demands and limited adaptability of traditional prediction models to complex conditions, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence-enabled predictive energy saving planning based on the Transformer-GRU model for predicting coolant temperature in the liquid cooling system of data centers. By integrating the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer and the time-series prediction strengths of GRU, the model performs correlation analysis and feature extraction of key parameters to achieve high-precision predictions of coolant return temperature. Experimental results demonstrate the model’s superior accuracy compared to traditional prediction models, achieving an MSE of 1.349, RMSE of 1.157, MAPE of 0.0244, and R2 of 81.07 %, significantly outperforming baseline models such as Transformer-LSTM (MSE = 1.355), Informer (MSE = 1.356), Reformer (MSE = 1.353), DeepAR (MSE = 1.385), LSTM (MSE = 1.351), GRU (MSE = 1.366), and CNN-GRU (MSE = 1.363). The model maintains high predictive accuracy under fluctuating environments and complex cooling conditions, effectively reducing the operational energy consumption of the liquid cooling system. This advancement not only enhances cooling efficiency but also drives data centers toward greater intelligence and sustainability. By leveraging real-time monitoring data and predictive control, the model dynamically optimizes cooling strategies, reducing coolant and energy usage while promoting sustainable resource utilization.

abstract = {Background
Although Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) (OpenAI) may be an appealing educational resource for students, the chatbot responses can be subject to misinformation. This study was designed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on a board-style multiple-choice dental knowledge assessment to gauge its capacity to output accurate dental content and in turn the risk of misinformation associated with use of the chatbot as an educational resource by dental students.
Methods
ChatGPT3.5 and ChatGPT4 were asked questions obtained from 3 different sources: INBDE Bootcamp, ITDOnline, and a list of board-style questions provided by the Joint Commission on National Dental Examinations. Image-based questions were excluded, as ChatGPT only takes text-based inputs. The mean performance across 3 trials was reported for each model.
Results
ChatGPT3.5 and ChatGPT4 answered 61.3% and 76.9% of the questions correctly on average, respectively. A 2-tailed t test was used to compare 2 independent sample means, and a 2-tailed χ2 test was used to compare 2 sample proportions. A P value less than .05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Conclusion
ChatGPT3.5 did not perform sufficiently well on the board-style knowledge assessment. ChatGPT4, however, displayed a competent ability to output accurate dental content. Future research should evaluate the proficiency of emerging models of ChatGPT in dentistry to assess its evolving role in dental education.
Practical Implications
Although ChatGPT showed an impressive ability to output accurate dental content, our findings should encourage dental students to incorporate ChatGPT to supplement their existing learning program instead of using it as their primary learning resource.}

abstract = {Objective
This systematic review aimed to summarize and evaluate the available information regarding the performance of artificial intelligence on dental implant classification and peri-implant pathology identification in 2D radiographs.
Data Sources
Electronic databases (Medline, Embase, and Cochrane) were searched up to September 2024 for relevant observational studies and both randomized and controlled clinical trials. The search was limited to studies published in English from the last 7 years. Two reviewers independently conducted both study selection and data extraction. Risk of bias assessment was also performed individually by both operators using the Quality Assessment Diagnostic Tool (QUADAS-2).
Study Selection
Of the 1,465 records identified, 29 references were selected to perform qualitative analysis. The study characteristics were tabulated in a self-designed table. QUADAS-2 tool identified 10 and 15 studies to respectively have a high and an unclear risk of bias, while only four were categorized as low risk of bias. Overall, accuracy rates for dental implant classification ranged from 67 % to 99 %. Peri-implant pathology identification showed results with accuracy detection rates over 78,6 %.
Conclusions
While AI-based models, particularly convolutional neural networks, have shown high accuracy in dental implant classification and peri-implant pathology detection, several limitations must be addressed before widespread clinical application. More advanced AI techniques, such as Federated Learning should be explored to improve the generalizability and efficiency of these models in clinical practice.

abstract = {Despite the claim that artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to increase efficiency in and for airlines, current literature is limited concerning models and frameworks to assess AI applications and their implications for airline efficiency. In response, we a) conceptualize and propose an AI-Airline-Efficiency-Model (AAEM) that allows for a more structured management approach for a systematic review and analysis of existing literature, and b) present a framework explicating the identified areas of AI application for airline efficiency based on a the AAEM model. In particular, using the four AI elements Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing and their applications within six identified airline departments, we systematically review and analyze key attributes and characteristics of both AI and airline efficiencies to critically assess current research efforts. We found that AI applications are built around four overarching improvement areas predictive analytics, resource optimization, safety & autonomous processes and passenger experience, but lack a cross-department and inter-organizational focus and are often theoretical in nature. This study provides insight into most prevalent AI applications and the less popular applications applied in and for passenger transport, thereby presenting the dominating AI techniques that are covered by existing literature as well as highlighting a wide range of emerging AI techniques with the potential to become more influential for future studies. We discuss theoretical and managerial implications and offer avenues for future research.}

abstract = {The advent of affordable technology has significantly influenced the practice of digital pathology, leading to its growing adoption within the pathology community. This review article aimed to outline the latest developments in digital pathology, the cutting-edge advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) applications within this field, and the pertinent United States regulatory frameworks. The content is based on a thorough analysis of original research articles and official United States Federal guidelines. Findings from our review indicate that several Food and Drug Administration-approved digital scanners and image management systems are establishing a solid foundation for the seamless integration of advanced technologies into everyday pathology workflows, which may reduce device and operational costs in the future. AI is particularly transforming the way morphologic diagnoses are automated, notably in cancers like prostate and colorectal, within screening initiatives, albeit challenges such as data privacy issues and algorithmic biases remain. The regulatory environment, shaped by standards from the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services/Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, and College of American Pathologists, is evolving to accommodate these innovations while ensuring safety and reliability. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services/Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments have issued policies to allow pathologists to review and render diagnoses using digital pathology remotely. Moreover, the introduction of new digital pathology Current Procedural Terminology codes designed to complement existing pathology Current Procedural Terminology codes is facilitating reimbursement processes. Overall, these advancements are heralding a new era in pathology that promises enhanced diagnostic precision and efficiency through digital and AI technologies, potentially improving patient care as well as bolstering educational and research activities.}
