abstract = {The growing demand for clean energy and the limitations of conventional thermal systems necessitates the integration of advanced technologies to enhance efficiency, adaptability, and sustainability. This review critically examines recent advancements in the application of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence for optimizing thermal energy systems, including solar collectors, heat exchangers, and latent heat storage units. Nanotechnology (particularly the use of nano-enhanced phase change materials and nanofluids such as Al₂O₃ and CuO) has shown to improve thermal conductivity by up to 28.8 %, accelerating energy absorption and storage rates. Concurrently, artificial intelligence algorithms, especially artificial neural networks and particle swarm optimization, enable predictive modelling, real-time system control, and fault detection, with some models achieving prediction accuracies above 97 % under complex operational conditions. The review emphasizes the synergistic potential of combining these technologies to create intelligent, self-regulating thermal energy systems. However, the paper also identifies critical challenges including computational overhead, cost of nanoparticle synthesis, lack of reproducibility in artificial intelligence implementations, and insufficient validation under extreme scenarios. Commercial deployment case studies (such as artificial intelligence-driven phase change material-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in smart buildings) are discussed to illustrate practical viability, reporting energy savings of up to 28 % with return-on-investment periods under three years. The paper concludes by proposing integrated research directions that combine multiscale material innovation with robust artificial intelligence training on dynamic datasets. This dual approach is essential to developing scalable, cost-effective, and resilient thermal energy systems capable of supporting global energy transitions.}

This quantitative study utilized a questionnaire to determine the level of engagement in two language technologies: translation software and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) toward language learning of 334 prospective Chinese engineers in an International Engineering College. It also explored significant differences in respondents’ level of engagement in translation software and GAI across different disciplines of engineering and examined the relationship between the two language technologies. Results reveal that respondents demonstrated ‘sometimes’ in their engagement in language technologies. Further, a significant difference was identified in engagement with translation and GAI when respondents were categorized according to discipline. Finally, engagement in translation software was found to be significantly related to engagement in Generative Artificial Intelligence.}

A SWOT matrix distils convergent concerns—weaponised disinformation, privacy erosion, and the detection arms race—alongside under-explored opportunities in education, therapy, and creative industries. To test whether these scholarly themes resonate with citizens, a computer-assisted web survey (N = 7,083) measured perceived risks and benefits across 10 specific scenarios for each theme. Correspondence analysis and Bonferroni-adjusted means reveal a pronounced age gradient for benefits, whereas risk perceptions vary by country—younger cohorts are noticeably less alarmed only in Sweden, France, and Czechia. Geographically, Dutch, German, British, and Italian publics prove the most enthusiastic: the United Kingdom (UK) couples similar enthusiasm with markedly higher risk vigilance, whereas Czech and Swedish respondents remain consistently sceptical, underscoring a broad, though imperfect, west/south versus central/north divide. The Netherlands, Germany, the UK, and Italy value pro-social applications (i.e., realistic crisis drills, public-interest campaigns, and therapeutic ‘mental-health’ avatars), with the Netherlands topping four benefit items and Italy favouring commercial/entertainment uses such as virtual brand ambassadors. By contrast, Czech and Swedish respondents assign uniformly low benefit scores. Juxtaposed with risk perceptions, the UK and Czechia register the greatest vigilance, Sweden the most relaxed, and others intermediate. Divergence seems associated with digital literacy levels and regulatory maturity. The survey reveals a statistically and practically significant gap between perceived risks and benefits: across all seven countries, respondents, on average, rate risks higher than advantages. Regression estimates indicate that advancing age, lower household income, and gender (woman) enlarge this gap—primarily by undermining perceived benefits—whereas tertiary education and residence in certain western or southern European countries—notably, Germany and Italy—are associated with more balanced appraisals. This study concludes that layered governance, interoperable detection standards, and targeted literacy programmes are urgently required.}

The aim of the present study is to explain the effect of the impinging jet configuration of elongated jet holes on the heat transfer distribution with a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs preserve spatial relationships through convolutional operations—unlike traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which require flattening of input data—allowing for higher accuracy with smaller datasets and faster training due to fewer trainable parameters. The goal is to understand how accurate and fast deep learning models with limited data can deliver predictions for complex systems such as jet impingement cooling. The proposed CNN model was compared with the numerical and experimental data. Jet impingement cooling was examined with four different Reynolds numbers (16250, 21700, 27100, 36250) and six dimensionless gaps between the jet and the target surface (G/D = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). Mean and local Nusselt number (Nu) distributions were investigated in particular. G/D = 2 was selected as the test data for the model among the configurations. While the CFD model failed to identify this peak performance point, the CNN model accurately captured this maximum behavior despite being trained only on other configurations. Moreover, the CNN model demonstrated more suitable prediction accuracy in the first two jet impingement regions than the CFD data, especially in capturing peak Nusselt numbers and localized hot spots. It has been determined that the CNN model provided more accurate predictions of the local Nusselt numbers within the measurement region compared to the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study for the average Nu, the proposed CNN model showed a closer agreement to experimental data than numerical simulation by 4.15 % at the Re = 32500 and G/D = 2.}

While scholars have highlighted the role of responsible AI in advancing responsible innovation, conceptualized as a transparent, reflexive, and inclusive process that engages all stakeholders, existing research has concentrated on initiatives at the AI design phase. As such, the processes through which responsible AI can be collaboratively implemented with external stakeholders to facilitate responsible innovation remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study employs a mixed-methods approach, comprising in-depth interviews (N = 26) and surveys (N = 618), to examine the relationship between responsible AI and responsible innovation. Drawing upon affordance–actualization theory, our findings reveal that responsible AI catalyzes three external stakeholder affordances: joint planning, joint problem-solving, and ethical climate. These affordances lead to immediate outcomes—stakeholder engagement and collective ethical efficacy—that ultimately foster responsible innovation. This study contributes to the literature on responsible AI by identifying three affordances related to the external stakeholders and one contextual factor, organizational mindfulness. It enriches the literature on responsible innovation by advancing the digital technology view and empirically examining the stepwise process through which responsible AI affects responsible innovation.}

The introduction of artificial intelligence technology has provided a clear definition for the “green technology revolution”. Compared with traditional methods, AI has achieved a significant improvement in computational efficiency in environmental data analysis, reducing decision-making time by more than 60%. This effectively supports the efficient resolution of complex environmental issues. Meanwhile, the rapid leap-forward development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is giving rise to a green technological revolution in environmental research. Based on this survey and the developing Digital Catalysis Platform, this commentary systematically summarizes the typical applications of AI in five major areas: treatment of water pollution, control of air pollution, disposal of solid waste, remediation of soil, and environmental health. It focuses on analyzing the remarkable effectiveness demonstrated by AI through machine learning (ML) methods. Such effectiveness is shown in aspects like material screening, performance prediction, instant detection, global distribution simulation of pollutants, and the control of human health. Notably, the current large-scale application of AI technology in the environmental field still faces multiple challenges, especially the scarcity of data samples in complex environmental systems. For instance, small-sample models to overfit, and the uneven geographical coverage of observational data in global pollutant distribution prediction. They all urgently need to be solved. In response to the above-mentioned bottlenecks, this study proposes corresponding solutions. As the technological bottlenecks are gradually overcome, AI is expected to become the core driving force for promoting environmentally sustainable development and contribute to the achievement of the “dual carbon” goals and the restoration of the global ecosystem.}

Our objective is to systematically identify the factors that shape clinical reasoning in medicine, based on six factors that were historically considered beyond the reach of statistical methods: open-endedness, unanalyzed stimulus-equivalences, empty cells, theory mediation, insufficient time, and highly configured functions. Nevertheless, a pertinent consideration in the age of AI is whether these once-considered insurmountable specific factors of clinicians are now subject to scrutiny or not. Through example in AI, we demonstrate that a deeper understanding of these factors not only sheds light on clinical decision-making and its heuristic processes but also underscores the significance of collaboration between AI experts and healthcare professionals.

abstract = {Background
The larynx of infants and neonates is occasionally challenging to identify using video laryngoscope. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted model that can identify the larynx, including the opening vocal cord and the arytenoid portion, on images obtained using a video laryngoscope.
Methods
First, 1197 images were extracted by the author from the 653 videos for train and validation data. An AI-assisted model for identifying the larynx was developed using YOLOv8n. Then, 399 images were selected from the additional 63 videos for the test data at every 150 frames.
Results
The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of the AI-assisted model for identifying the larynx were 0.74, 0.99, and 0.91, respectively. The AI model correctly identified the opening vocal cord and arytenoid portion in cases without obstacles. Esophageal misidentification of the larynx and undetected cases of the larynx caused by obstacles were observed.
Conclusions
The AI-assisted model effectively identified the larynx, including the opening vocal cord and the arytenoid portion, during video laryngoscopy and potentially can enhance the safety of tracheal intubation of infants and neonates. However, esophageal misidentification remains critical. Further studies are needed to refine the model and ensure its reliability in clinical practice.}

abstract = {It has become clear that the need for huge datasets represents a bottleneck for applications of artificial intelligence classes. In pathology, there is the additional problem that there are often substantially fewer annotated target lesions than normal tissues for comparison. While deep learning algorithms have successfully tackled problems previously thought to be solely the domain of humans, this dependence on massive amounts of data is one of the major ways in which computer models of the brain are deficient. Organic brains utilize large numbers of specialized neural nets arranged in both linear and parallel fashion, with each solving a restricted classification problem. They rely on local error corrections such as Hebbian learning (“neurons that fire together wire together”) as compared to the nonlocal back-propagation used in most implementations of artificial neural nets. They incorporate reinforcement into their learning strategy. For these reasons, even toddlers can easily classify objects after one or only a few examples. Rather than provide an overview of current research articles on artificial intelligence in the pathology literature, this review will focus on general strategies for dealing with the huge datasets that we routinely encounter. These include transfer learning, zero-shot learning, Siamese networks, one-class models, generative networks, and reinforcement learning. Neither an extensive mathematical background nor advanced programming skills are needed in order to make these subjects accessible to pathologists with limited background in the nuts and bolts of machine learning. However, some familiarity with the basic principles of deep learning is necessary. In chapter 4 we provide a detailed description of these approaches. In this chapter we show how they are used to ameliorate training data needs. By providing an overview and extension of these concepts, this material will help to understand some of the current limitations of machine learning and how to address these. We begin with classical approaches and then move on to newer methodologies.}

We furthermore reveal a distinct relationship between ex-ante occupational work content and ex-post exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) and automation (robots). Workers in occupations with high AI exposure perform different activities and face different skill requirements compared to workers in occupations exposed to robots, suggesting that robots and AI are substitutes for different activities and skills. We also document that changes in the task and skill content of occupations is related to ex-ante exposure to technologies. Finally, the study uses individual labour market biographies to investigate the relationship between AI and wages. By exploring the dynamic influence of AI exposure on individuals over time, the study uncovers positive associations with wages, with nuanced variations across occupational groups, thereby shedding further light on the substitutability and augmentability of AI.}

The results suggest that AI significantly promotes the energy transition, and the promotion effect is greater in resource-based cities and central and eastern cities at the city level, as well as in strategic emerging industries and capital-intensive industries at the industry level. Regarding the influence mechanism, AI development can improve the energy transition by promoting green technology innovation and digital transformation. However, importantly, at higher levels of AI development, risks such as the energy rebound effect could arise. In this case, excessive investment and use of electricity may counteract the increase in the energy transition.

The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) offers new opportunities for applications in emergency medicine, including patient triage. This study evaluates the performance of the Swiss Medical Assessment System (SMASS), an AI-based decision-support tool for rapid patient assessment, in comparison with the well-established Manchester Triage System (MTS).
Methods
In this retrospective analysis, patients aged 18 years or above presenting to the Department of Emergency Medicine at Kepler University Hospital in Linz, Austria, during November and December 2024 with non-traumatic complaints were included. Each patient underwent emergency triage using MTS, conducted by a registered nurse, with SMASS applied in parallel. SMASS had no influence on clinical decision-making.
Results
In the study period, 1021 patients were triaged with both MTS and SMASS. The mean patient age was 60 years (SD: 21), and 53 % were women. Of the patients categorized as “orange” by MTS, 19 % were classified as non-urgent by SMASS. Conversely, 28 % of the patients triaged as “green” by MTS were classified as urgent by SMASS. Additionally, 23 % of patients classified as non-urgent by SMASS required hospitalization following emergency department evaluation and treatment. Agreement between SMASS and MTS in triaging emergency patients was low as measured by a Cohen's kappa of 0.167.
Conclusions
In this study of patients presenting to a large tertiary-care emergency department, SMASS demonstrated considerable discrepancies in triage classification compared to MTS, with significant rates of both over- and undertriage. Further validation is necessary before integrating AI-based triage tools into routine clinical practice.}

abstract = {The rapid integration of intelligent processes and methods into information systems in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) era has led to a substantial shift towards autonomous software decision-making. This evolution necessitates robust human oversight, especially in critical domains like Healthcare, Education, and Energy. Human trust in AI plays a vital role in influencing decision-making processes of users interacting with AI. This paper presents VIRTSI (Variability and Impact of Reciprocal Trust States towards Intelligent systems), a novel rigorous computational model for human-AI Interaction. VIRTSI simulates human trust states, spanning from overtrust to distrust, through user modelling. It comprises: 1. A trust dynamics representational model based on Deterministic Finite State Automata (DFAs), illustrating transitions among cognitive trust states in response to AI-generated replies. 2. A trust evaluation model based on Confusion Matrices, originating from machine learning and Accuracy Metrics, providing a quantitative framework for analysing human trust dynamics. As a result, this is the first time that trust dynamics have been thoroughly traced in a representational model and a method has been developed to assess the impact of possibly harmful states like overtrust and distrust. An empirical study on the recently launched Large Language Model of generative AI, ChatGPT (version 3.5), provides a radical underexplored AI-generated platform for evaluating the human-AI interaction through VIRTSI. The study involved 1200 interactions of real users as well as AI experts together with experts in two very different domains of evaluation, namely software engineering and poetry. This study traces trust dynamics and the emerging human-AI interaction, in concrete examples of real user synergies with generative AI. The research reveals the vital role of maintaining normal trust states for optimal human-AI interaction and that both AI and human users need further steps towards this goal. The real-world implications of this research can guide the creation and evaluation of user interfaces with AI and the incorporation of functionalities in the development of generative AI chatbots in terms of trust by providing a new rigorous DFA representational method of trust dynamics and a corresponding new perspective of confusion matrix evaluation method of the dynamics’ impact in the efficiency of human-AI dialogues.}

abstract = {The increasing frequency of extreme events, including natural disasters and man-made attacks, poses significant threats to power systems, highlighting the urgent need for resilience research. This research is generally divided into three phases: pre-disaster, in-disaster, and post-disaster. The pre-disaster phase centers on impact prediction, enabling risk warnings and proactive resource deployment. During the in-disaster phase, the emphasis shifts to real-time event monitoring and operational adjustments to minimize adverse effects. The post-disaster phase is dedicated to coordinating emergency resources to rapidly restore power loads and infrastructure. Enhancing power system resilience necessitates the integration of multi-source data and high-efficiency resource management. Artificial intelligence (AI), with its advanced computational capabilities, has emerged as a key enabler, driving substantial growth in AI-based resilience research. However, a comprehensive approach to AI integration remains underexplored. This article reviews recent advancements in resilient power systems and evaluates AI-based approaches across three critical areas: extreme event modeling, resilience assessment and early warning, and loss mitigation and restoration. Finally, the paper identifies future challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.}

Indeed, thanks to the development of innovative practices, Sustainable Development Goal 4 has been enhanced. This goal is one of the 17 global goals established by the United Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It consists of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and of promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all. Over the last decade, new applications and digital tools have allowed future interpreters to access training materials in the field of Public Service Interpreting (PSI) and to develop their skills during their training. The full potential of these AI tools, however, have yet to be fully explored in the field of Translation and Interpreting, and specifically in the Public Service sector. Transcription and audio recognition tools have been analysed (Ünlü, 2023; Parrilla Gómez and Postigo Pinazo, 2023), as well as the tools to support preparation phases such as terminology management (Braun, 2019). But the use of the different AI options available on the market require further analysis to verify their validity for training purposes. Given the important role of new technologies in the training of interpreters, and the need to upskill interpreters working in the public sector, we explored the potential of AI technologies to help ensure quality training and the attainment of the 2030 Education Agenda. The research questions were thus as follows: What are the ethical and pedagogical implications of AI for the training of Public Service interpreters? How can educators, researchers and future interpreters benefit from these tools? And lastly: Which tools could adequately replace the real materials which are lacking? In order to answer these questions, three AI tools (Chat GPT, Twee, and ElevenLabs) have been analysed to assess their effectiveness in generating material for the bilateral interpreting classroom in the context of public services, and then to analyse the students‘ and teachers’ opinion of these materials.}

These findings confirm the versatility of UTAUT2 in elucidating technological adoption processes in higher education. Performance expectancy and hedonic motivation emerged as significant predictors of intentions and effective use among students, faculty, and administrative staff. Among students, perceived ease of use and social influence were also relevant. The analysis revealed differences in adoption patterns between STEM and non-STEM disciplines and between public and private institutions. Despite widespread positive perceptions of AI's potential, barriers such as distrust and lack of knowledge persist. The research also identified moderating and mediating factors, such as prior technology experience and technological self-efficacy. These results have important implications for the implementation of AI in higher education, suggesting the need for differentiated approaches according to the characteristics of each group and institutional context. It is recommended to develop strategies that address the identified barriers and leverage facilitators, with an emphasis on training, ethical design, and contextual adaptation of AI applications. Future research should explore the longitudinal evolution of these factors and examine AI adoption in non-STEM disciplines in greater depth.}

We developed and investigated an integrated framework combining comprehensive generative AI literacies—functional, critical and ethical, and creative—with self-regulated learning (SRL) processes operationalized as a human-centered Plan, Iterate, Evaluate cycle. Thirty-eight undergraduate students enrolled in an “Artificial Intelligence and Writing” course completed scaffolded experiential challenges followed by self-directed creative projects. Quantitative analysis revealed significant growth in AI literacy self-efficacy across all dimensions, with students progressing from moderate initial confidence (M = 4.68, SD = 2.11) to high confidence levels (M = 8.39, SD = 1.04) on a 10-point scale (t = −9.86, p < .001). Qualitative analysis of project artifacts and student process reflections identified a taxonomy of human in the loop practices integrating AI literacies and self-regulation across the Plan, Iterate, Evaluate cycle. Planning practices involved activating domain knowledge to identify AI applications and establishing evaluative criteria. Iteration practices included developing multi-step workflows, refining prompts through dialogue, and monitoring output quality. Evaluation practices combined assessment of project outcomes with reflection on collaboration processes to inform future use. These practices illustrated adaptive human-AI collaboration strategies that augment rather than replace students’ disciplinary expertise and creative vision. These findings suggest scaffolded experiential learning integrating AI literacies and metacognitive processes can promote effective AI collaboration and empower students to actively direct their own learning.}

Despite changing contexts, certain obligations remain constant: scholars have an obligation to prioritize scientific and personal integrity above the pursuit of individual success, and they must ethically use research tools, including information technology search processes and writing technologies, as part of their scientific processes. The first obligation is built on personal integrity, which in turn characterizes how the second is implemented. My career spanned the last quarter of the 20th century through the first quarter of the 21st century. During this period, there were significant advancements in research methodologies, including the capability of internet search technologies to access scientific databases and desktop writing and referencing software. These advances pale in comparison to the meteoric rise of artificial intelligence large language models (AI LLMs) over the last five years, where information retrieval and writing tools have transformed how we access and use information – potentially placing our personal and authorial integrity at risk. Given this rapid transformation, my autobiography’s objectives are: 1) to share my developmental perspectives on personal and authorial integrity and examine the impact of early experiences where perceived plagiarism helped me define those principles; 2) to review professional guidelines concerning research integrity and policy recommendations for AI LLMs; 3) to discuss changes in my scholarly content resulting from evolving search strategies, writing tools, and journal growth; and 4) by using examples of AI-generated and AI-assisted writing samples, to address the influence of AI LLMs on authorial integrity, including practical risks, opportunities, and current recommended strategies for managing AI LLMs in scholarly writing. By sharing my perspectives, I hope to provide guidance for those pursuing scholarly careers that ensures their authorial integrity.}

Traditional risk assessment for tongue cancer relies on clinicopathological parameters. Although tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are promising prognostic markers, their evaluation lacks standardization. This study aimed to validate established prognostic factors and introduce an artificial intelligence (AI)-based TIL assessment method.
Methods
We analyzed 139 tongue cancer cases from a single institution (2010–2017) to establish prognostic factors and developed an AI model for TIL quantification. Clinicopathological characteristics including AI- and manually assessed TILs were evaluated.
Results
The AI-assessed stromal TIL ratio exerted protective effects across all stages and demonstrated superior discriminative capability compared to manual evaluation (C-index: 0.649 vs. 0.604 for overall survival [OS]), with substantial inter-method agreement (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient = 0.796). In the multivariate analysis, a statistical model incorporating the lymph node ratio, AI-assessed stromal TIL ratio, depth of invasion grade, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and a close surgical resection margin (<5 mm) showed superior prognostic performance, with excellent discriminative power (OS area under the curve [AUC]: 0.851; recurrence-free survival [AUC]: 0.826). Stage-specific analysis revealed that advanced-stage patients were significantly affected by adverse factors and stromal TIL levels, whereas early stage patients showed trends but no statistically significant associations.
Conclusions
AI-based stromal TIL assessment outperformed manual TIL assessment as a prognostic marker. This AI approach robustly predicts survival when combined with factors such as the lymph node ratio and a close resection margin status (<5 mm). Our findings may enhance risk stratification, particularly in advanced-stage disease.}

While several secondary studies have explored the application of AI in Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), they often focus on specific AI techniques or particular PLF activities, limiting a broader understanding of the field. This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art of AI applications in PLF, highlighting both achievements and areas that require further investigation. To this end, a tertiary systematic mapping study was conducted following recognized guidelines to ensure reliability and replicability. The research process involved formulating 10 research questions, designing a comprehensive search strategy, and performing a rigorous quality assessment of the identified studies. From an initial pool of 738 retrieved manuscripts, 14 high-quality secondary studies were selected and analyzed. The findings reveal a wide range of AI techniques applied in PLF, particularly in the learning and perception AI domains. These techniques have proven effective in tasks such as animal recognition, abnormality detection, and health and welfare monitoring. However, comparatively less attention has been given to environmental monitoring and sustainability, highlighting an area that warrants further exploration. By offering valuable insights for future research and practical applications, this study suggests directions for both researchers and livestock farmers to unlock AI's full potential in PLF.}

abstract = {This study examines Chinese university music teachers' responses to AI integration using structural equation modeling (N = 317). Through Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, we investigate relationships between technology impact awareness, job insecurity, proactive personality, and active learning intention. Results reveal a “technology impact-job insecurity decoupling effect”: technology awareness directly motivates learning (β = 0.519, p < 0.001) without triggering job insecurity as mediator. While job insecurity positively influences learning intention (β = 0.338, p < 0.001), it does not mediate the technology-learning relationship. Proactive personality moderates the insecurity-learning link (β = 0.132, p < 0.001). To explain this decoupling, we propose an “art-technology cognitive separation” mechanism whereby music teachers perceive AI as an auxiliary tool enhancing rather than threatening their artistic core. These finding challenges traditional assumptions that technological threats necessarily induce occupational anxiety before motivating adaptation. The study extends COR theory to creative professions and suggests institutions should focus on increasing AI awareness through opportunity-framed exposure rather than threat-based messaging, while tailoring support strategies to teachers' personality traits.}

However, we are entering an era where a broader understanding of the expression patterns of a wide variety of targets is beginning to be understood. As an example, PSMA PET has shown potential utility in the imaging of clear cell renal cell carcinoma and other malignancies with high rates of neovascularity. Many of the theranostic agents in the pipeline are designed to bind against "pan-cancer" targets such as fibrinogen-activating protein or the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4, or targets that become over-expressed in a broad variety of cancer states, such as those that target carbonic anhydrase IX. Artificial intelligence methods will assist us in appropriately selecting patients and in delivering predictive and prognostic imaging biomarkers. Given the wide potential applicability of emerging theranostic agents, it will be incumbent upon the field to carefully design clinical trials that will lead to regulatory approvals that will, in turn, permit broad use across a number of cancer types. In our future clinical practices, we will evolve to leverage precision medicine to identify target expression and deliver appropriate theranostic agents that are not limited to a specific cell of origin or disease state.}

In this work, we have conducted a systematic mapping study to identify the challenges and solutions associated with the software architecture of quantum-enhanced artificial intelligence systems. The results of the systematic mapping study reveal several architectural patterns that describe how quantum components can be integrated into inference engines, as well as middleware patterns that facilitate communication between classical and quantum components. Each pattern realises a trade-off between various software quality attributes, such as efficiency, scalability, trainability, simplicity, portability, and deployability.

This study examines the impact and mechanisms through which AI affects the sustainable development performance of international trade enterprises in China. Utilizing an unbalanced panel dataset of 3853 firms from 2010 to 2023, the study employs a two-way fixed effects model to analyze financial and environmental social responsibility performance. The findings demonstrate that AI significantly improves financial performance and environmental social responsibility, thereby enhancing overall sustainable development performance. This conclusion is robust across various endogeneity and robustness tests, including lagged core explanatory variables, instrumental variable methods, Heckman tests, DID tests, elimination of extreme observations, exclusion of abnormal year samples, substitution of core explanatory variables, and unrelated industry regression. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the positive impact of AI on sustainable development performance is more pronounced in the eastern region and among non-state-owned firms. Mechanism analysis reveals that AI enhances financial performance and sustainability through total factor productivity (TFP) and increased average wages, although it has a negative impact on environmental social responsibility performance. Based on these results, the study provides policymakers and business managers with relevant recommendations for leveraging AI to promote sustainable business development. This research is the first to comprehensively explore the impact of AI on the sustainability performance of international trading firms within a unified framework, thereby expanding the existing literature and offering valuable insights for both policymakers and practitioners.}

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into education has the potential to transform learning experiences, particularly in nursing. Understanding students' perceptions of AI and its impact on psychological factors, such as self-efficacy and psychological distress, is crucial for effective implementation.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that influence nursing students' perceptions of AI, psychological distress, and self-efficacy.
Design
A cross-sectional study design was used.
Participants and setting
This study was conducted using a convenience sample of 108 nursing students from a public university in Saudi Arabia.
Methods
Three instruments were used: The Perceptions of AI, Kessler Psychological Distress, and Self-Efficacy scales. Data were analyzed using independent sample t-tests, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, and multiple linear regression.
Results
The study found that participants who used AI displayed significant differences in their self-efficacy. Additionally, notable associations were found between perceptions of AI, self-efficacy, and psychological distress. However, while the regression models were significant, the perceptions of AI did not meaningfully explain the variance in these outcomes (p > 0.05).

In the context of epilepsy, electroencephalography (EEG), a technique used for over a century, has historically been resistant to automated analysis due to the complexity of the signals and the challenges posed by artifact management. While the human eye excels at recognizing patterns, algorithms have demonstrated superior capabilities in detecting and characterizing specific features, such as long-term dynamics and synchrony. Furthermore, the advent of wearable EEG devices has led to an exponential increase in data volume, surpassing the limits of visual interpretation. AI algorithms are now being developed to address these limitations, offering enhanced efficiency in both identifying subtle signal features and managing massive datasets. This review explores the fundamental principles of AI and its transformative potential in the field of EEG. It discusses the implications and the current limitations, including improvements limited to aggregation of already known knowledge, for epilepsy diagnosis, medical and surgical treatment, and innovative approaches to patient monitoring, including seizure forecasting, highlighting how AI is poised to redefine the management of epilepsy.}

Adaptive radiotherapy (ART) may improve treatment quality by monitoring variations in patient anatomy and incorporating them into the treatment plan. This systematic review investigated the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in computed tomography (CT)-based ART for head and neck (H&N) cancer.
Methods
A comprehensive search of main electronic databases was conducted until April 2024. Titles and abstracts were reviewed to evaluate the compliance with inclusion criteria: CT-based imaging for photon ART of H&N patients and AI applications. 17 original retrospective studies with samples sizes ranging from 37 to 239 patients were included. The quality of the studies was evaluated with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 and the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM) tools. Key metrics were examined to evaluate the performances of the proposed AI-methods.
Results
Overall, the risk of bias was low. The average CLAIM score was 70%. A major finding was that generated synthetic CTs improved similarity metrics with planning CT compared to original cone-beam CTs, with average mean absolute error up to 39 HU and maximum improvement of 80%. Auto-segmentation provided an efficient and accurate option for organ-at-risk delineation, with average Dice similarity coefficient ranging from 80 to 87%. Finally, AI models could be trained using clinical and radiomic features to predict the effectiveness of ART with accuracy above 80%.
Conclusions
Automation of processes in ART for H&N cancer is very promising throughout the entire chain, from the generation of synthetic CTs and auto-segmentation to predict the effectiveness of ART.}

User-friendly artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are increasingly being explored to assist healthcare teams in their decision-making processes. As accurate diagnosis in all medical fields is vital in treatment planning, this research seeks to explore the function of two specific AI chatbots, ChatGPT and Perplexity AI, in distinguishing the various types of dysphonia (organic, functional, and neurological).
Material and methods
In experiment 1, a script combining voice self-assessments plus the acoustic analysis, and in experiment 2, only the acoustic analysis of 37 dysphonic patients was fed into the ChatGPT and Perplexity AI chatbots specifying the type and asked to develop a complex AI-based model to determine dysphonia type. Then, the same process was redone with data from a sample of 27 other patients as a test.
Results
Although ChatGPT could not analyze the data and only provided guidance, the Cohen's Kappa agreement between experts’ diagnoses and Perplexity AI diagnoses in experiment 1 (P=0.773) and experiment 2 (P=0.067) lacked statistically significance.
Conclusion
Regarding the preliminary poor performance of AI chatbots in differential diagnosis of dysphonia type, it is not currently recommended to use them in clinical settings. However, modifications in AI chatbots in the future might provide more promising results in determining the dysphonia type. Further research is needed to shed light on AI chatbots ability in voice clinics.}

abstract = {People with impaired decision-making capacity enjoy the same rights to access technology as people with full capacity. Our paper looks at realising this right in the specific contexts of artificial intelligence (AI) and mental capacity legislation. Ireland's Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, 2015 commenced in April 2023 and refers to ‘assistive technology’ within its ‘communication’ criterion for capacity. We explore the potential benefits and risks of AI in assisting communication under this legislation and seek to identify principles or lessons which might be applicable in other jurisdictions. We focus especially on Ireland's provisions for advance healthcare directives because previous research demonstrates that common barriers to advance care planning include (i) lack of knowledge and skills, (ii) fear of starting conversations about advance care planning, and (iii) lack of time. We hypothesise that these barriers might be overcome, at least in part, by using generative AI which is already freely available worldwide. Bodies such as the United Nations have produced guidance about ethical use of AI and these guide our analysis. One of the ethical risks in the current context is that AI would reach beyond communication and start to influence the content of decisions, especially among people with impaired decision-making capacity. For example, when we asked one AI model to ‘Make me an advance healthcare directive’, its initial response did not explicitly suggest content for the directive, but it did suggest topics that might be included, which could be seen as setting an agenda. One possibility for circumventing this and other shortcomings, such as concerns around accuracy of information, is to look to foundational models of AI. With their capabilities to be trained and fine-tuned to downstream tasks, purpose-designed AI models could be adapted to provide education about capacity legislation, facilitate patient and staff interaction, and allow interactive updates by healthcare professionals. These measures could optimise the benefits of AI and minimise risks. Similar efforts have been made to use AI more responsibly in healthcare by training large language models to answer healthcare questions more safely and accurately. We highlight the need for open discussion about optimising the potential of AI while minimising risks in this population.}

The focus on food quality has heightened, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strict standards throughout the food processing chain. This chapter highlights AI's role at critical points of quality control in the production line, such as raw material assessments, processing, final product inspections, and packaging, with an emphasis on AI's potential to ensure compliance with quality benchmarks. AI's applications in food quality maintenance include the use of machine learning and computer vision for automated quality checks of raw materials, real-time monitoring during processing, and consistent evaluations of finished products to detect anomalies. Furthermore, AI-driven insights can enhance packaging integrity by identifying defects and predicting shelf life, thus supporting a more efficient and reliable production system. As the food industry continues to embrace AI innovations, these advancements promise to transform quality control processes, ensuring improved safety, compliance, and operational efficiency worldwide. Focusing on quality rather than quantity in production enhances overall product performance. Here, AI plays a crucial role by accurately assessing demand to meet the right quantity of food products needed, minimizing waste while ensuring quality. Food waste, costing over $1 trillion yearly, significantly impacts both global hunger and environmental sustainability, with UNEP reporting 1.05 billion tons of food wasted in 2022 alone. AI-driven demand forecasting offers a solution by addressing food industry complexities in data temporality, output measures, and predictive variables, crucial for managing perishable items. Advanced algorithms like random forest and long short-term memory (LSTM) improve forecasting accuracy, reducing waste by up to 52% and unmet demand by 16%. As generative AI and large language models evolve, they can refine demand predictions, minimizing waste and enhancing efficiency, profitability, and sustainability in the food sector.}

Competitors used a new dataset of historical map images to train, validate, and evaluate their models. Automated georeferencing pipelines attained a median root-mean square error of 1.1 km. Prompt-based extraction (i.e., with user input) of polygons, polylines, and points from geologic maps yielded median F1 scores of 0.77, 0.56, 0.35, respectively. Geologic maps pose numerous challenges for AI workflows because they vary significantly.

abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and treatment recommendation performance of four artificial intelligence chatbots in fictional pulpal and periradicular disease cases. Additionally, it investigated response consistency and the influence of text order and language on chatbot performance.
Methods
In this cross-sectional comparative study, eleven cases representing various pulpal and periradicular pathologies were created. These cases were presented to four chatbots (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4.0, Bard, and Bing) in both Portuguese and English, with the information order varied (signs and symptoms first or imaging data first). Statistical analyses included the Kruskal-Wallis test, Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner pairwise comparisons, simple logistic regression, and the binomial test.
Results
Bing and ChatGPT 4.0 achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy rates (86.4 % and 85.3 % respectively), significantly outperforming ChatGPT 3.5 (46.5 %) and Bard (28.6 %) (p < 0.001). For treatment recommendations, ChatGPT 4.0, Bing, and ChatGPT 3.5 performed similarly (94.4 %, 93.2 %, and 86.3 %, respectively), while Bard exhibited significantly lower accuracy (75 %, p < 0.001). No significant association between diagnosis and treatment accuracy was found for Bard and Bing, but a positive association was observed for ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4.0 (p < 0.05). The overall consistency rate was 98.29 %, with no significant differences related to text order or language. Cases presented in Portuguese prompted significantly more additional information requests than those in English (33.5 % vs. 10.2 %; p < 0.001), with the relevance of this information being higher in Portuguese (29.5 % vs. 8.5 %; p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Bing and ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy, while Bard showed the lowest accuracy in both diagnosis and treatment recommendations. However, the clinical application of these tools necessitates critical interpretation by dentists, as chatbot responses are not consistently reliable.}

Therefore, this study examined a random sample of 1,098 German adults to assess their attitudes, experiences, and usage intentions regarding AI in work, healthcare, and education. The findings indicated that respondents generally held favorable attitudes towards AI, with AI applications in healthcare receiving more positive evaluations than AI in the context of work. Moreover, cognitive evaluations of AI were more positive than emotional or behavioral appraisals. Prior experiences with AI were, however, limited, particularly in healthcare and education. Demographic differences were generally small. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that, in Germany, AI is currently widely accepted in different domains, although most people have little first-hand experience with it.

This study investigates the application of ChatGPT-4 in extracting and classifying behavioral data from scientific literature, focusing on the daily time-activity budget of dairy cows. Accurate analysis of time-activity budgets is crucial for understanding dairy cow welfare and productivity. Traditional methods are time-intensive and prone to bias. This study evaluates the accuracy and reliability of ChatGPT-4 in data extraction and data categorization, considering explicit, inferred, and ambiguous labels for the data, compared with human analysis. A collection of 55 papers on dairy cow behavior were used in the studies. Data extraction for eating, ruminating, and lying behaviors was performed manually and via ChatGPT-4. The artificial intelligence (AI) model's accuracy and labeling performance were assessed through descriptive and statistical analyses. Mixed model analysis was used to compare human and AI outcomes. Artificial intelligence and human time budget data showed significant differences for eating and ruminating but not for lying. ChatGPT-4 estimated daily eating time at 22.3% compared with 23.8% by humans. For ruminating, AI reported 33.4% against 31.7% by humans. Daily lying times were nearly identical, with AI at 44.4% and human analysis at 44.2%. The global accuracy in data extraction was ∼75%, and labeling accuracy reached 67.3%, with significant variability across behavioral categories. In general, the AI model demonstrates moderate accuracy in extracting and categorizing behavioral data, particularly for inferred and ambiguous data. However, explicit data extraction posed challenges, highlighting AI's dependence on input quality and structure. The consistency between AI and human analyses for lying behavior underscores AI's potential for specific applications. ChatGPT-4 offers a promising complementary tool for behavioral research, enabling efficient and scalable data extraction. However, improvements in AI algorithms and standardized reporting in scientific literature are essential for broader applicability. The study advocates for hybrid approaches combining AI capabilities with human oversight to enhance the reliability and accuracy of dairy cow behavioral research.}

However, the questions of how to define and evaluate AGI remain unclear. This perspective article proposes that the evaluation of AGI should be rooted in dynamic embodied physical and social interactions (DEPSI). More specifically, we propose five critical characteristics to be considered as AGI benchmarks and suggest the Tong test as an AGI evaluation system. The Tong test describes a value- and ability-oriented testing system that delineates five levels of AGI milestones through a virtual environment with DEPSI, allowing for infinite task generation. We contrast the Tong test with classical AI testing systems in terms of various aspects and propose a systematic evaluation system to promote standardized, quantitative, and objective benchmarks and evaluation of AGI.}

abstract = {Urban morphology, defined by the characteristics and spatial arrangement of urban structures, significantly affects urban microclimate in terms of thermal environments, wind dynamics, energy use, and outdoor air quality. Despite extensive research in this field, these effects are intensified by climate change and rapid urbanization, posing challenges to urban sustainability, such as poor air quality, increased energy demands, and pedestrian discomfort. While artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer promising solutions for addressing these challenges, the field lacks standardized approaches for implementing these technologies. By leveraging urban morphology indicators such as sky view factor, building density, and green space ratio, AI models can analyze complex interactions across various spatiotemporal scales. However, significant variability in methodologies, indicators, and datasets limits the generalizability and applicability of these techniques. By synthesizing 111 studies over the last decade utilizing urban morphology and AI models to predict urban microclimate, this review aims to bridge these gaps and highlight AI’s unique potential to contribute to the field. Analyzed studies reported that key urban morphology indicators, particularly building density and height, explain up to 75% of land surface temperature variance across seasons, while sky view factor accounts for over 67% of heat exposure variations in urban environments, with these findings emerging from multiple independent investigations across diverse urban contexts. Random Forest emerges as the most widely adopted AI technique, demonstrating robust performance across different applications. Emerging trends, such as hybrid approaches combining AI with physics-based models, are highlighted as promising avenues for advancing the field. Our review identifies the need for standardized frameworks and datasets to enhance model applicability. The study presents actionable insights for climate-responsive urban planning and lays the groundwork for interdisciplinary studies, enabling the development of resilient, sustainable urban environments amid the growing challenges of urbanization and climate change.}

To address the shortcomings of previously established methodologies, this research proposes a unique Artificial Intelligence driven sensor-based methodology that utilizes the SisFall dataset in conjunction with a Recurrent Neural Network - Long Short-Term Memory model. Two methods were considered: one using a Butterworth filter and the other without filtering. The results emphasize the significance of noise reduction in enhancing model performance. Additionally, the integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques brings transparency and interpretability to the model’s predictions, enhancing its dependability and trustworthiness in healthcare applications. Using Artificial Intelligence driven fall detection with Explainable Artificial Intelligence for transparent decision-making, this methodology presents a robust approach to improving accuracy and reducing false alarms in real-world healthcare settings. The study demonstrates that combining advanced filtering techniques with Explainable Artificial Intelligence algorithms successfully overcomes the challenges associated with traditional fall detection systems. The findings further confirm that the application of an Artificial Intelligence based Butterworth filter significantly enhances model accuracy, achieving 98.96% compared to 79.77% without filtering. These findings highlight the potential of Artificial Intelligence driven fall detection systems in healthcare, paving the way for more accurate, interpretable, and reliable monitoring solutions that can enhance elderly safety and improve real-time clinical decision-making.}

Nonetheless, applying it in the clinic has been slow because of issues with the spectrum's complexity, background noise, and differences in biological samples. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into SERS has made its use for diagnostics much better by allowing automation of spectral preprocessing, noise removal, key information extraction, and accurate classification. Traditional machine learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) AI algorithms can effectively interpret complex SERS data and recognize the biomarkers specific to different diseases in non-invasive samples such as serum, saliva, urine, breath condensates, and exosomes. AI-SERS technology provides a quick, scalable way to find cancer at an early stage, classify the type of cancer, and track the effects of therapy, matching the goals of precision oncology. It clearly explains the fundamentals of SERS, AI-based techniques to signal analysis and how the two are employed together in oncology. We describe new progress toward diagnosing many cancers, assessing outcomes, and tracking how patients react to therapy. In particular, the review presents the use of AI-enhanced SERS platforms for cancers of different types, such as breast cancer (BC), lung cancer (LC), prostate cancer (PCa), skin cancer, oral cancer, gastrointestinal cancers, colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PaC), and ovarian cancer (OvCa). We also discuss how these platforms are being used for early diagnosis, monitoring treatment effects, and predicting the possibility of the disease returning. Ultimately, we discuss how key translational challenges like data standardization, the ability to explain models, and the need for approval by authorities must be dealt with before AI-SERS can be used routinely in clinical oncology.}

Empirical assessments of theoretical hypotheses were conducted utilizing survey data gathered from 717 executives across global firms. We found strong evidence that internal innovation resources (IIR) and collaborative innovation networks (CIN) have a positive impact on firm's AI orientation. The study revealed that environmental uncertainty (EU) can negatively moderate the relationship between internal innovation resources, collaborative innovation networks, and AI orientation. A positive moderating effect was observed between corporate digital culture (DC) and the relationship between internal innovation resources, collaborative innovation networks, and AI orientation. Meanwhile, we found a positive moderating effect of Executives' Not-Invented-Here Syndrome (NIHS) on the relationship between internal innovation resources and AI orientation. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on AI strategy in management and offers valuable guidance for organizations seeking to harness the potential of AI in a rapidly changing business environment.}

abstract = {Purpose
The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is rapidly evolving, with potential to improve both the clinician and patient experience. We sought to evaluate whether popular AI text-to-image generators could create anatomically accurate images of common hand surgery procedures. We hypothesized that the AI-generated images would not be adequate as patient education materials.
Methods
We queried five AI text-to-image generators: Craiyon, DALL-E, DeepSeek, Gemini, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. They were given the prompt, “Create an anatomically accurate image with labels of [Condition] surgical approach to be used as a visual aid for patient education,” with the following conditions inserted: carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren contracture, trigger finger, thumb carpometacarpal arthritis, and de Quervain tenosynovitis. Images were then graded on legibility, detail and clarity, anatomical realism and accuracy, appropriate surgical site, and lack of fabricated anatomy. Images could score a maximum of 2 points per each criterion, with an assumed Control score of 10 points.
Results
A total of 1,500 images were generated and reviewed. When comparing total scores, all AI generators performed significantly lower than the Control, except for DALL-E’s images of Dupuytren contracture. For the image detail and clarity category, DALL-E, DeepSeek, Gemini, and Midjourney all scored similarly to the Control and each other. For the remaining criteria (legibility, anatomic realism, surgical site, fabricated anatomy), each of the AI generators scored significantly lower than the Control generator. In total, 99.8% of images contained at least some degree of fabricated anatomy. DALL-E consistently had the highest scores for each category, while Craiyon had the lowest.
Conclusions
Although the AI servers successfully produced highly detailed and visually engaging images, they failed to portray accurate anatomy and often included fictitious structures. Further work is needed to train and fine tune AI models to produce accurate and appropriate images.
