abstract = {Agriculture intensification has a paradoxical effect, as it increases food production and productivity by increasing farmer’s return on investment while instantaneously posing a serious threat to long-term sustainability like depletion of resources, soil degradation, water scarcity and finally environmental pollution. All these challenges have flickered concerns about the quality of life. To bash all these concerns, the precise and judicious use of agricultural inputs is necessary. Bespoke solutions (Site-Specific) tailored to specific problems can optimize resource utilization while minimizing negative impacts. Integrating advanced technologies like automation by the use of sensors, drones and robotics guarantees solutions in the context of availability and efficiency of agricultural labour decline. This technology-driven approach can reform agriculture. So, the holistic approach of using technological advancements with sustainable practices is necessary for a long-term ecological balance with enhancement in productivity. The integration of driven solutions allows farmers to obtain real-time insights into soil health, water availability and nutrient status facilitating sustainable farming practices. The main goal of this manuscript is to review the applications of AI in agriculture for crop monitoring with sustainable use of resources such as soil, water, and nutrients, as well as to elevate food production with better quality maintenance. This article scrutinizes the findings of several researchers to get a brief outline of the subject of the recent execution of automation in agriculture and compares it with conventional methods followed by the farmer.}

However, training a language model for domain-specific tasks is hugely costly and requires high computational power, thereby restricting its true potential for standard tasks. This study, therefore, provides a comprehensive analysis of the latest pre-trained LLMs for various NLP-related applications without fine-tuning them to evaluate their effectiveness. Five language models are thus employed in this study on six distinct NLP tasks (including emotion recognition, sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, irony detection, offensiveness detection, and stance detection) for 12 languages from low- to medium- and high-resource. Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) and Gemini Pro outperform state-of-the-art models, achieving average F1 scores of 70.6% and 68.8% on the Tweet Sentiment Multilingual dataset compared to the state-of-the-art average F1 score of 66.8%. The study further interprets the findings obtained by the LLMs using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).

This study systematically reviews research conducted between 2015 and 2024 on teachers' use of AI technology in their teaching and professional development, focusing on the relationship between the supply of professional development opportunities and the demand for AI integration among teachers. Using PRISMA principles and protocols, this review identified and synthesized 95 relevant research articles. The findings reveal a significant imbalance in research focus. Specifically, 65% of the studies examined the application of AI in teaching, including technologies such as conversational AI and related technologies, AI-driven learning and assessment systems, immersive technologies, visual and auditory computing, and teaching and learning analytics. In contrast, only 35% of the studies explored AI's role in enhancing teacher professional development. This review highlights a gap in research addressing the development needs of teachers as they integrate AI technologies into their teaching practices. It emphasizes the need for future research to focus more on the potential of AI in teacher professional development and to investigate how AI technologies can be applied in education from both the perspectives of student learning and teacher instruction. Furthermore, research on AI in professional development should prioritize addressing technological and ethical challenges to ensure the responsible and effective integration of AI in education.}

The aim of the present study is to explain the effect of the impinging jet configuration of elongated jet holes on the heat transfer distribution with a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs preserve spatial relationships through convolutional operations—unlike traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which require flattening of input data—allowing for higher accuracy with smaller datasets and faster training due to fewer trainable parameters. The goal is to understand how accurate and fast deep learning models with limited data can deliver predictions for complex systems such as jet impingement cooling. The proposed CNN model was compared with the numerical and experimental data. Jet impingement cooling was examined with four different Reynolds numbers (16250, 21700, 27100, 36250) and six dimensionless gaps between the jet and the target surface (G/D = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). Mean and local Nusselt number (Nu) distributions were investigated in particular. G/D = 2 was selected as the test data for the model among the configurations. While the CFD model failed to identify this peak performance point, the CNN model accurately captured this maximum behavior despite being trained only on other configurations. Moreover, the CNN model demonstrated more suitable prediction accuracy in the first two jet impingement regions than the CFD data, especially in capturing peak Nusselt numbers and localized hot spots. It has been determined that the CNN model provided more accurate predictions of the local Nusselt numbers within the measurement region compared to the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study for the average Nu, the proposed CNN model showed a closer agreement to experimental data than numerical simulation by 4.15 % at the Re = 32500 and G/D = 2.}

The introduction of artificial intelligence technology has provided a clear definition for the “green technology revolution”. Compared with traditional methods, AI has achieved a significant improvement in computational efficiency in environmental data analysis, reducing decision-making time by more than 60%. This effectively supports the efficient resolution of complex environmental issues. Meanwhile, the rapid leap-forward development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is giving rise to a green technological revolution in environmental research. Based on this survey and the developing Digital Catalysis Platform, this commentary systematically summarizes the typical applications of AI in five major areas: treatment of water pollution, control of air pollution, disposal of solid waste, remediation of soil, and environmental health. It focuses on analyzing the remarkable effectiveness demonstrated by AI through machine learning (ML) methods. Such effectiveness is shown in aspects like material screening, performance prediction, instant detection, global distribution simulation of pollutants, and the control of human health. Notably, the current large-scale application of AI technology in the environmental field still faces multiple challenges, especially the scarcity of data samples in complex environmental systems. For instance, small-sample models to overfit, and the uneven geographical coverage of observational data in global pollutant distribution prediction. They all urgently need to be solved. In response to the above-mentioned bottlenecks, this study proposes corresponding solutions. As the technological bottlenecks are gradually overcome, AI is expected to become the core driving force for promoting environmentally sustainable development and contribute to the achievement of the “dual carbon” goals and the restoration of the global ecosystem.}

In this brief historical overview, viewed through the lens of artificial intelligence (AI), we propose that comprehending the reasoning behind AI can enhance our understanding of clinical reasoning. Our objective is to systematically identify the factors that shape clinical reasoning in medicine, based on six factors that were historically considered beyond the reach of statistical methods: open-endedness, unanalyzed stimulus-equivalences, empty cells, theory mediation, insufficient time, and highly configured functions. Nevertheless, a pertinent consideration in the age of AI is whether these once-considered insurmountable specific factors of clinicians are now subject to scrutiny or not. Through example in AI, we demonstrate that a deeper understanding of these factors not only sheds light on clinical decision-making and its heuristic processes but also underscores the significance of collaboration between AI experts and healthcare professionals.

abstract = {Objectives
Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are essential for synthesizing high-quality evidence in clinical research, health economics and outcomes research, and health technology assessments. However, the growing volume of published data has made SLRs time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly. To address these challenges, we introduce A4SLR, an agentic artificial-intelligence-assisted SLR framework, which provides a flexible, extensible methodology for automating the entire SLR process-from initial query formulation to evidence synthesis-across various study fields.
Methods
A4SLR comprises 8 modules integrated with specialized artificial intelligence agents powered by large language models: search, I/E criteria deployment, abstract/full-text screening, text/table pre-processing, data extraction, assessment, risk of bias analysis, and report. We implemented and validated this framework using 2 use cases, non-small cell lung cancer and perinatal mood and anxiety disorders. Performance of the assessment was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively.
Results
Our implementation demonstrated high accuracy in article screening (F1 scores: 0.917-0.977), risk of bias assessment (Cohen’s k: 0.8442-0.9064), and data extraction (F-scores: 0.96-0.998), including patient characteristics, safety and efficacy outcomes, economic model parameters, and cost-effectiveness data. Notably, the text/table preprocessing agent yielded comprehensive coverage of data elements, particularly in the challenging tasks of accurately matching outcome values to their corresponding study arms.
Conclusions
Our findings highlight the potential of the A4SLR framework to transform the evidence synthesis process by addressing the limitations of manual SLRs, thereby enhancing health economics and outcomes research and health technology assessments. Designed as a scalable, user-centric, extensible approach, A4SLR provides a robust solution for generating comprehensive up-to-date evidence to support researchers and decision makers across diverse clinical and therapeutic areas.}

The larynx of infants and neonates is occasionally challenging to identify using video laryngoscope. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted model that can identify the larynx, including the opening vocal cord and the arytenoid portion, on images obtained using a video laryngoscope.
Methods
First, 1197 images were extracted by the author from the 653 videos for train and validation data. An AI-assisted model for identifying the larynx was developed using YOLOv8n. Then, 399 images were selected from the additional 63 videos for the test data at every 150 frames.
Results
The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of the AI-assisted model for identifying the larynx were 0.74, 0.99, and 0.91, respectively. The AI model correctly identified the opening vocal cord and arytenoid portion in cases without obstacles. Esophageal misidentification of the larynx and undetected cases of the larynx caused by obstacles were observed.
Conclusions
The AI-assisted model effectively identified the larynx, including the opening vocal cord and the arytenoid portion, during video laryngoscopy and potentially can enhance the safety of tracheal intubation of infants and neonates. However, esophageal misidentification remains critical. Further studies are needed to refine the model and ensure its reliability in clinical practice.}

Results indicate that the application of AI significantly promotes enterprises' participation in value chain activities and extends the value chain production length. Mechanism analysis reveals two primary channels through which AI exerts its influence: by enhancing enterprise production efficiency and deepening the specialization and division of labor within enterprises, thereby extending the length of GVCs in production activities. In addition, AI has a heterogeneous effect on the participation of different enterprises in the GVCs and production complexity, and the effect is more pronounced in asset-intensive and technology-intensive enterprises, non-state-owned enterprises, as well as small enterprises.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved through various trends, with different subfields gaining prominence over time. Currently, conversational AI—particularly generative AI—is at the forefront. Conversational AI models are primarily focused on text-based tasks and are commonly deployed as chatbots. Recent advancements by OpenAI have enabled the integration of external, independently developed models, allowing chatbots to perform specialized, task-oriented functions beyond general language processing.
Objective
This study aims to develop a smart chatbot that integrates large language models from OpenAI with specialized domain-specific models, such as those used in medical image diagnostics. The system leverages transfer learning via Google’s Teachable Machine to construct image-based classifiers and incorporates a diabetes detection model developed in TensorFlow.js. A key innovation is the chatbot’s ability to extract relevant parameters from user input, trigger the appropriate diagnostic model, interpret the output, and deliver responses in natural language. The overarching goal is to demonstrate the potential of combining large language models with external models to build multimodal, task-oriented conversational agents.
Methods
Two image-based models were developed and integrated into the chatbot system. The first analyzes chest X-rays to detect viral and bacterial pneumonia. The second uses optical coherence tomography images to identify ocular conditions such as drusen, choroidal neovascularization, and diabetic macular edema. Both models were incorporated into the chatbot to enable image-based medical query handling. In addition, a text-based model was constructed to process physiological measurements for diabetes prediction using TensorFlow.js. The architecture is modular; new diagnostic models can be added without redesigning the chatbot, enabling straightforward functional expansion.
Results
The findings demonstrate effective integration between the chatbot and the diagnostic models, with only minor deviations from expected behavior. Additionally, a stub function was implemented within the chatbot to schedule medical appointments based on the severity of a patient’s condition, and it was specifically tested with the optical coherence tomography and X-ray models.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing advanced AI systems—including image-based diagnostic models and chatbot integration—by leveraging AI as a service. It also underscores the potential of AI to enhance user experiences in bioinformatics, paving the way for more intuitive and accessible interfaces in the field. Looking ahead, the modular nature of the chatbot allows for the integration of additional diagnostic models as the system evolves.}

To train an AI model, however, a large dataset is typically required, especially when using the most powerful techniques. Therefore, not all specialties are taking advantage of AI techniques in the same way. For instance, they are seldomly used in areas such as the diagnosis of rare diseases since, due to their low prevalence, not enough data are typically available to train an AI model. In this paper, we address the use of AI techniques to diagnose a particular rare disease: Collagen VI-related Congenital Muscular Dystrophy from confocal microscopy images. We apply both classical machine learning and modern deep learning techniques and we show that, when using the appropriate data management and training procedures, one can successfully derive a highly-accurate classifier even with a limited amount of training data. Due to the generality of the explored techniques, this conclusion is likely to hold also for most of the rare diseases whose diagnosis relies on the examination of histological images.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the traditionally lengthy and expensive process of drug discovery and development. Driven by advances in computational power and the exponential growth of biomedical data, AI is unlocking new opportunities to optimize drug research and development (R&D) processes while reducing costs. This chapter explores AI’s pivotal role at key stages, ranging from target identification and drug design to chemical synthesis optimization and preclinical studies. AI algorithms are capable of analyzing vast datasets, predicting molecular properties, generating novel compounds, optimizing reaction conditions, and assessing pharmacokinetics and toxicity with greater speed and precision than conventional approaches. However, several challenges, including issues related to data quality, model transparency, and effective integration into existing workflows, hinder its full-scale adoption. In this chapter, we address these obstacles and propose strategies to overcome them, underscoring AI’s transformative potential in driving the future of pharmaceutical innovation.}

However, there is insufficient empirical evidence on how much Chinese English as a foreign language (EFL) students are ready to accept and implement AI tools in their L2 learning. To address this gap, drawing on theory of planned behavior (TPB), the present quantitative study employed a survey with 283 EFL students from different Chinese universities. The results of a one-sample t-test and descriptive statistics revealed that Chinese EFL students had demonstrated an above-average level of AI readiness in their L2 education reflecting the three dimensions of TPB (i.e., attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control) through an emphasis on positive attitudes towards and intentions to adopt AI tools. They also showed higher than average scores in three sub-factors of AI readiness (i.e., ethics, ability, and vision). Only the cognitive dimension was below the average point. The results are discussed in relation to TPB and practical implications are provided for EFL students and teachers to maintain and develop their level of AI readiness in the context of L2 education.}

abstract = {The increasing frequency of extreme events, including natural disasters and man-made attacks, poses significant threats to power systems, highlighting the urgent need for resilience research. This research is generally divided into three phases: pre-disaster, in-disaster, and post-disaster. The pre-disaster phase centers on impact prediction, enabling risk warnings and proactive resource deployment. During the in-disaster phase, the emphasis shifts to real-time event monitoring and operational adjustments to minimize adverse effects. The post-disaster phase is dedicated to coordinating emergency resources to rapidly restore power loads and infrastructure. Enhancing power system resilience necessitates the integration of multi-source data and high-efficiency resource management. Artificial intelligence (AI), with its advanced computational capabilities, has emerged as a key enabler, driving substantial growth in AI-based resilience research. However, a comprehensive approach to AI integration remains underexplored. This article reviews recent advancements in resilient power systems and evaluates AI-based approaches across three critical areas: extreme event modeling, resilience assessment and early warning, and loss mitigation and restoration. Finally, the paper identifies future challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.}

While its benefits are manifold, AI also has a significant environmental impact: AI technology usually relies on hardware which consumes a significant amount of energy, such as GPU servers. Furthermore, users normally access AI-based services via their own end devices, which also consume energy. The energy side of training and using AI models can be roughly estimated today, for example using libraries like CodeCarbon. However, a realistic estimate of AI’s environmental impact needs to include not only the energy consumption from the use of the AI, but also factors such as the (critical) raw materials needed for the construction of the hardware, and the consumption of materials and energy for the maintenance and use of the hardware throughout its life cycle. This is not feasible today. Systematic life cycle assessment of AI technology is still in its infancy. It should not be limited to calculating the CO2-equivalent, but take into account different relevant environmental impact indicators from resource use depletion to human toxicity to water consumption. This paper reviews the literature on this topic, identifies gaps and opportunities for research and argues for developing an LCA methodology for AI. It further presents an adaptation of an existing LCA methodology to AI as a first step in this direction.}

While publications applying AI in allergy and immunology have increased in number, clinical implementation substantially lags behind other specialties. By mid-2024, over 1,000 US Food and Drug Administration–approved AI-enabled medical devices existed, but none specifically addressed allergy and immunology. This gap partly reflects the field’s limited reliance on imaging, which facilitated early AI breakthroughs in radiology and pathology. This narrative review examines recent AI developments, including large language models and AI agents, evaluating their applicability to allergy and immunology practice. We analyze current and potential applications, emphasizing those demonstrating clinical value while identifying implementation barriers amplified by allergic diseases’ unique complexities, including data privacy concerns, bias, reliability constraints, and evolving regulatory frameworks. To bridge the persistent research-to-implementation gap, we propose a 6-point road map: (1) prioritize impactful applications, (2) define clinically relevant benchmarks, (3) enforce rigorous governance, (4) transition to operationalization, (5) promote clinical adoption through trustworthy AI, and (6) establish life cycle management. This road map builds on established implementation frameworks while incorporating critical field-specific considerations unique to allergy and immunology. Through this approach, we provide a perspective for advancing AI in allergy and immunology from academic promise to tangible clinical benefit.}

Indeed, thanks to the development of innovative practices, Sustainable Development Goal 4 has been enhanced. This goal is one of the 17 global goals established by the United Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It consists of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and of promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all. Over the last decade, new applications and digital tools have allowed future interpreters to access training materials in the field of Public Service Interpreting (PSI) and to develop their skills during their training. The full potential of these AI tools, however, have yet to be fully explored in the field of Translation and Interpreting, and specifically in the Public Service sector. Transcription and audio recognition tools have been analysed (Ünlü, 2023; Parrilla Gómez and Postigo Pinazo, 2023), as well as the tools to support preparation phases such as terminology management (Braun, 2019). But the use of the different AI options available on the market require further analysis to verify their validity for training purposes. Given the important role of new technologies in the training of interpreters, and the need to upskill interpreters working in the public sector, we explored the potential of AI technologies to help ensure quality training and the attainment of the 2030 Education Agenda. The research questions were thus as follows: What are the ethical and pedagogical implications of AI for the training of Public Service interpreters? How can educators, researchers and future interpreters benefit from these tools? And lastly: Which tools could adequately replace the real materials which are lacking? In order to answer these questions, three AI tools (Chat GPT, Twee, and ElevenLabs) have been analysed to assess their effectiveness in generating material for the bilateral interpreting classroom in the context of public services, and then to analyse the students‘ and teachers’ opinion of these materials.}

This paper aims to contribute to a concept of a framework that allows the application of AI in model-based systems engineering (MBSE) processes of automated production systems; the main focus is hereby on the MBSE processes. The aim of the complete framework is to realize an AI-based, self-learning digital twin that automatically adapts to the real system behavior and represents an optimal image of a product and its production process at all times. An expressive, semantic overall model serves as the basis for new approaches to artificial intelligence. In the complete framework, knowledge gained using AI methods is integrated into the overall model and thus brought into an overall context. Such an overall model improves the interpretability and explainability of the AI models and enables complex analyses, simulations and forecasts. The core element of the approach is a novel, AI-based, self-learning engineering model consisting of a product and production model that maps function, behavior and product geometry. Graph-based design languages are used for forming a central data model and functional mock-up units are applied for continuous co-simulation. The approach is underlined by means of an application to the design of automated assembly systems.}

These findings confirm the versatility of UTAUT2 in elucidating technological adoption processes in higher education. Performance expectancy and hedonic motivation emerged as significant predictors of intentions and effective use among students, faculty, and administrative staff. Among students, perceived ease of use and social influence were also relevant. The analysis revealed differences in adoption patterns between STEM and non-STEM disciplines and between public and private institutions. Despite widespread positive perceptions of AI's potential, barriers such as distrust and lack of knowledge persist. The research also identified moderating and mediating factors, such as prior technology experience and technological self-efficacy. These results have important implications for the implementation of AI in higher education, suggesting the need for differentiated approaches according to the characteristics of each group and institutional context. It is recommended to develop strategies that address the identified barriers and leverage facilitators, with an emphasis on training, ethical design, and contextual adaptation of AI applications.

Thirty-eight undergraduate students enrolled in an “Artificial Intelligence and Writing” course completed scaffolded experiential challenges followed by self-directed creative projects. Quantitative analysis revealed significant growth in AI literacy self-efficacy across all dimensions, with students progressing from moderate initial confidence (M = 4.68, SD = 2.11) to high confidence levels (M = 8.39, SD = 1.04) on a 10-point scale (t = −9.86, p < .001). Qualitative analysis of project artifacts and student process reflections identified a taxonomy of human in the loop practices integrating AI literacies and self-regulation across the Plan, Iterate, Evaluate cycle. Planning practices involved activating domain knowledge to identify AI applications and establishing evaluative criteria. Iteration practices included developing multi-step workflows, refining prompts through dialogue, and monitoring output quality. Evaluation practices combined assessment of project outcomes with reflection on collaboration processes to inform future use. These practices illustrated adaptive human-AI collaboration strategies that augment rather than replace students’ disciplinary expertise and creative vision. These findings suggest scaffolded experiential learning integrating AI literacies and metacognitive processes can promote effective AI collaboration and empower students to actively direct their own learning.}

Despite changing contexts, certain obligations remain constant: scholars have an obligation to prioritize scientific and personal integrity above the pursuit of individual success, and they must ethically use research tools, including information technology search processes and writing technologies, as part of their scientific processes. The first obligation is built on personal integrity, which in turn characterizes how the second is implemented. My career spanned the last quarter of the 20th century through the first quarter of the 21st century. During this period, there were significant advancements in research methodologies, including the capability of internet search technologies to access scientific databases and desktop writing and referencing software. These advances pale in comparison to the meteoric rise of artificial intelligence large language models (AI LLMs) over the last five years, where information retrieval and writing tools have transformed how we access and use information – potentially placing our personal and authorial integrity at risk. Given this rapid transformation, my autobiography’s objectives are: 1) to share my developmental perspectives on personal and authorial integrity and examine the impact of early experiences where perceived plagiarism helped me define those principles; 2) to review professional guidelines concerning research integrity and policy recommendations for AI LLMs; 3) to discuss changes in my scholarly content resulting from evolving search strategies, writing tools, and journal growth; and 4) by using examples of AI-generated and AI-assisted writing samples, to address the influence of AI LLMs on authorial integrity, including practical risks, opportunities, and current recommended strategies for managing AI LLMs in scholarly writing. By sharing my perspectives, I hope to provide guidance for those pursuing scholarly careers that ensures their authorial integrity.}

The findings reveal that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), especially YOLOv8, offer superior performance in visual-based poultry health detection, achieving over 90 % accuracy for conditions like bumblefoot and woody breast. IoT-enabled sensors continuously track temperature, humidity, and flock activity, allowing automated systems to adjust ventilation, lighting, and feed distribution.

This review introduces a structured taxonomy of AI/ML applications grouped into five domains: disease detection, behaviour analysis, environmental control, automation, and productivity optimization. A comparative table of state-of-the-art techniques and their respective performance metrics is provided to highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach. Challenges such as limited infrastructure, high initial costs, and digital illiteracy among smallholders hinder broader adoption. Research gaps are identified in dataset generalizability, multi-modal sensor fusion, and the lack of scalable real-world trials. Future directions include developing lightweight, energy-efficient models, enhancing user-friendly interfaces, and promoting policy frameworks that support ethical and inclusive AI adoption.

Traditional risk assessment for tongue cancer relies on clinicopathological parameters. Although tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are promising prognostic markers, their evaluation lacks standardization. This study aimed to validate established prognostic factors and introduce an artificial intelligence (AI)-based TIL assessment method.
Methods
We analyzed 139 tongue cancer cases from a single institution (2010–2017) to establish prognostic factors and developed an AI model for TIL quantification. Clinicopathological characteristics including AI- and manually assessed TILs were evaluated.
Results
The AI-assessed stromal TIL ratio exerted protective effects across all stages and demonstrated superior discriminative capability compared to manual evaluation (C-index: 0.649 vs. 0.604 for overall survival [OS]), with substantial inter-method agreement (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient = 0.796). In the multivariate analysis, a statistical model incorporating the lymph node ratio, AI-assessed stromal TIL ratio, depth of invasion grade, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and a close surgical resection margin (<5 mm) showed superior prognostic performance, with excellent discriminative power (OS area under the curve [AUC]: 0.851; recurrence-free survival [AUC]: 0.826). Stage-specific analysis revealed that advanced-stage patients were significantly affected by adverse factors and stromal TIL levels, whereas early stage patients showed trends but no statistically significant associations.
Conclusions
AI-based stromal TIL assessment outperformed manual TIL assessment as a prognostic marker. This AI approach robustly predicts survival when combined with factors such as the lymph node ratio and a close resection margin status (<5 mm). Our findings may enhance risk stratification, particularly in advanced-stage disease.}

However, we are entering an era where a broader understanding of the expression patterns of a wide variety of targets is beginning to be understood. As an example, PSMA PET has shown potential utility in the imaging of clear cell renal cell carcinoma and other malignancies with high rates of neovascularity. Many of the theranostic agents in the pipeline are designed to bind against "pan-cancer" targets such as fibrinogen-activating protein or the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4, or targets that become over-expressed in a broad variety of cancer states, such as those that target carbonic anhydrase IX. Artificial intelligence methods will assist us in appropriately selecting patients and in delivering predictive and prognostic imaging biomarkers. Given the wide potential applicability of emerging theranostic agents, it will be incumbent upon the field to carefully design clinical trials that will lead to regulatory approvals that will, in turn, permit broad use across a number of cancer types. In our future clinical practices, we will evolve to leverage precision medicine to identify target expression and deliver appropriate theranostic agents that are not limited to a specific cell of origin or disease state.}

Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), including architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and transformers, offers new capabilities to overcome data sparsity, nonlinearity, and uncertainty in renewable-dominant systems. This study aims to comprehensively review the emerging role of Gen-AI in improving solar and wind forecasting, load prediction, energy storage management, and smart grid optimization. Using a comparative and synthesis-based methodology, this review analyses findings from high-impact publications between 2023 and 2025. Results indicate that GAN-based models reduce root mean square error (RMSE) by 15–20 % in solar irradiance forecasting and significantly enhance spatial-temporal wind simulations. Time-series GAN-LSTM hybrids enhance demand forecasting accuracy under nonlinear conditions, while VAE-driven dispatch models achieve gains of 9–12 % in energy efficiency and curtailment reduction. The novelty of this review lies in mapping Gen-AI's integration with digital twins, federated learning, and AI–IoT frameworks, which enables the real-time, privacy-preserving optimisation of complex energy systems. The principal conclusion is that Gen-AI serves as a transformative tool to enhance system resilience, forecasting precision, and operational flexibility in renewable energy networks. For sustainable implementation, future developments must address challenges in model explainability, data privacy, and scalability.

In this work, we have conducted a systematic mapping study to identify the challenges and solutions associated with the software architecture of quantum-enhanced artificial intelligence systems. The results of the systematic mapping study reveal several architectural patterns that describe how quantum components can be integrated into inference engines, as well as middleware patterns that facilitate communication between classical and quantum components. Each pattern realises a trade-off between various software quality attributes, such as efficiency, scalability, trainability, simplicity, portability, and deployability.

User-friendly artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are increasingly being explored to assist healthcare teams in their decision-making processes. As accurate diagnosis in all medical fields is vital in treatment planning, this research seeks to explore the function of two specific AI chatbots, ChatGPT and Perplexity AI, in distinguishing the various types of dysphonia (organic, functional, and neurological).
Material and methods
In experiment 1, a script combining voice self-assessments plus the acoustic analysis, and in experiment 2, only the acoustic analysis of 37 dysphonic patients was fed into the ChatGPT and Perplexity AI chatbots specifying the type and asked to develop a complex AI-based model to determine dysphonia type. Then, the same process was redone with data from a sample of 27 other patients as a test.
Results
Although ChatGPT could not analyze the data and only provided guidance, the Cohen's Kappa agreement between experts’ diagnoses and Perplexity AI diagnoses in experiment 1 (P=0.773) and experiment 2 (P=0.067) lacked statistically significance.
Conclusion
Regarding the preliminary poor performance of AI chatbots in differential diagnosis of dysphonia type, it is not currently recommended to use them in clinical settings. However, modifications in AI chatbots in the future might provide more promising results in determining the dysphonia type. Further research is needed to shed light on AI chatbots ability in voice clinics.}

abstract = {Purpose
Adaptive radiotherapy (ART) may improve treatment quality by monitoring variations in patient anatomy and incorporating them into the treatment plan. This systematic review investigated the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in computed tomography (CT)-based ART for head and neck (H&N) cancer.
Methods
A comprehensive search of main electronic databases was conducted until April 2024. Titles and abstracts were reviewed to evaluate the compliance with inclusion criteria: CT-based imaging for photon ART of H&N patients and AI applications. 17 original retrospective studies with samples sizes ranging from 37 to 239 patients were included. The quality of the studies was evaluated with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 and the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM) tools. Key metrics were examined to evaluate the performances of the proposed AI-methods.
Results
Overall, the risk of bias was low. The average CLAIM score was 70%. A major finding was that generated synthetic CTs improved similarity metrics with planning CT compared to original cone-beam CTs, with average mean absolute error up to 39 HU and maximum improvement of 80%. Auto-segmentation provided an efficient and accurate option for organ-at-risk delineation, with average Dice similarity coefficient ranging from 80 to 87%. Finally, AI models could be trained using clinical and radiomic features to predict the effectiveness of ART with accuracy above 80%.
Conclusions
Automation of processes in ART for H&N cancer is very promising throughout the entire chain, from the generation of synthetic CTs and auto-segmentation to predict the effectiveness of ART.}

Furthermore, the study also aims to investigate the mediating role of user innovativeness in this relationship. A cross-sectional, survey-based method was used to collect data from 410 university students. Structural equation modeling was implied to examine the research framework of the study. The findings confirm that financial services knowledge, familiarity with artificial intelligence, government support, and user innovativeness have a direct positive impact on Fintech adoption among university students. The results also show that perceived ease of use slightly moderates the relationship between government support and user innovativeness. Meanwhile, results from the mediation analysis reveal an indirect effect of these variables on Fintech adoption through user innovativeness. The study's findings recommend practical suggestions to academic institutes and Fintech service providers to equip university students with the necessary financial knowledge and familiarity with artificial intelligence across various disciplines, which can be achieved through sufficient government support. All these can potentially revolutionize Fintech services adoption and boost economic growth, specifically in Asia-Pacific developing countries. The study identifies the key antecedents that affect the student's decision to adopt Fintech. It widens the scope of Fintech adoption by considering the university students who may serve as the future managers for the nation. It provides nuanced evidence on the role of financial services knowledge and familiarity with the use of artificial intelligence on the intention to adopt Fintech among university students in Asia-Pacific developing countries like Pakistan.}

abstract = {People with impaired decision-making capacity enjoy the same rights to access technology as people with full capacity. Our paper looks at realising this right in the specific contexts of artificial intelligence (AI) and mental capacity legislation. Ireland's Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, 2015 commenced in April 2023 and refers to ‘assistive technology’ within its ‘communication’ criterion for capacity. We explore the potential benefits and risks of AI in assisting communication under this legislation and seek to identify principles or lessons which might be applicable in other jurisdictions. We focus especially on Ireland's provisions for advance healthcare directives because previous research demonstrates that common barriers to advance care planning include (i) lack of knowledge and skills, (ii) fear of starting conversations about advance care planning, and (iii) lack of time. We hypothesise that these barriers might be overcome, at least in part, by using generative AI which is already freely available worldwide. Bodies such as the United Nations have produced guidance about ethical use of AI and these guide our analysis. One of the ethical risks in the current context is that AI would reach beyond communication and start to influence the content of decisions, especially among people with impaired decision-making capacity. For example, when we asked one AI model to ‘Make me an advance healthcare directive’, its initial response did not explicitly suggest content for the directive, but it did suggest topics that might be included, which could be seen as setting an agenda. One possibility for circumventing this and other shortcomings, such as concerns around accuracy of information, is to look to foundational models of AI. With their capabilities to be trained and fine-tuned to downstream tasks, purpose-designed AI models could be adapted to provide education about capacity legislation, facilitate patient and staff interaction, and allow interactive updates by healthcare professionals. These measures could optimise the benefits of AI and minimise risks. Similar efforts have been made to use AI more responsibly in healthcare by training large language models to answer healthcare questions more safely and accurately. We highlight the need for open discussion about optimising the potential of AI while minimising risks in this population.}

This review systematically explores the integration of AI and renewable energy technologies in food processing and preservation, focusing on solar, wind, and biomass energy sources. AI applications like machine learning and neural networks improve energy management, process optimisation, and quality control in energy-intensive operations like drying, refrigeration, and packaging. Bibliometric analysis of 827 publications from 2015 to 2025 shows a rapid rise in interdisciplinary research driven by environmental concerns and technological advances. AI integration offers benefits like energy efficiency, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and improved food quality, but challenges like high initial costs, infrastructure limitations, and socioeconomic disparities persist. Case studies show AI automating laborious tasks and optimising processes powered by renewable energy. Standardised frameworks, economic evaluations, and lifecycle assessments are needed for sustainable implementation. As part of the future growth of AI technology, recommendations for additional studies have been underlined and advised. Therefore, food processors and legislators could benefit much from harnessing the potential of AI in renewable energy for sustainable development.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the feasibility, usability, and efficacy of innovative generative pretrained transformer chatbot in improving self-care in hypertensive patients in a resource-limited setting.
Patients and Methods
A single-arm nonblinded clinical trial was deployed in a busy cardiology clinic in a low-resource setting. Artificial intelligence–enabled chatbot (Healthy Heart Assistant) was activated in smartphones of 50 adults on treatment for hypertension. Participants were trained on how to use the Healthy Heart Assistant including setting medication and appointment reminders. Baseline questionnaires were administered at enrollment and 30 days later to explore acceptability, feasibility and usability of the bot. We used chatbot usability questionnaire and self-made Healthy Heart Assistant satisfaction questionnaire to assess bot usability and patients’ satisfaction, respectively. The study began on April 5, 2024, through July 15, 2024.
Results
Of 200 hypertensive clinic attendees, 70 (35%) had internet-enabled bot-compatible cell phones, of which 50 hypertensive patients were recruited to participate in the study. Among 50 participants, 2 (4%) were lost to follow-up; 19 (39.6%) were women; and 40 (83.3%) had attained tertiary level of education. Mean time of training to use bot was 5.7 minutes, with 35 (70.8%) of participants being able to use the bot within 5 minutes. The median frequency of chats for participants within the timeframe was an average of 1.5 chats/day. Chatbot usability questionnaire score was 69.5%, whereas self-made Healthy Heart Assistant satisfaction questionnaire score was 90%.
Conclusion
This proof-of-concept study shows that generative artificial intelligence can be applied with reasonable success in hypertension self-care in low-resource settings and has potential for being effective.}

The Artificial Intelligence for Critical Mineral Assessment Competition solicited innovative solutions for two challenges: 1) automated georeferencing of historical geologic and topographic maps, and 2) automated feature extraction from historical maps. Competitors used a new dataset of historical map images to train, validate, and evaluate their models. Automated georeferencing pipelines attained a median root-mean square error of 1.1 km. Prompt-based extraction (i.e., with user input) of polygons, polylines, and points from geologic maps yielded median F1 scores of 0.77, 0.56, 0.35, respectively. Geologic maps pose numerous challenges for AI workflows because they vary significantly.

To aid this, we present a scoping review in which the novelty of various AI techniques in monitoring fluxes through the EC method from the past two decades has been collected.

abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and treatment recommendation performance of four artificial intelligence chatbots in fictional pulpal and periradicular disease cases. Additionally, it investigated response consistency and the influence of text order and language on chatbot performance.
Methods
In this cross-sectional comparative study, eleven cases representing various pulpal and periradicular pathologies were created. These cases were presented to four chatbots (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4.0, Bard, and Bing) in both Portuguese and English, with the information order varied (signs and symptoms first or imaging data first). Statistical analyses included the Kruskal-Wallis test, Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner pairwise comparisons, simple logistic regression, and the binomial test.
Results
Bing and ChatGPT 4.0 achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy rates (86.4 % and 85.3 % respectively), significantly outperforming ChatGPT 3.5 (46.5 %) and Bard (28.6 %) (p < 0.001). For treatment recommendations, ChatGPT 4.0, Bing, and ChatGPT 3.5 performed similarly (94.4 %, 93.2 %, and 86.3 %, respectively), while Bard exhibited significantly lower accuracy (75 %, p < 0.001). No significant association between diagnosis and treatment accuracy was found for Bard and Bing, but a positive association was observed for ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4.0 (p < 0.05). The overall consistency rate was 98.29 %, with no significant differences related to text order or language. Cases presented in Portuguese prompted significantly more additional information requests than those in English (33.5 % vs. 10.2 %; p < 0.001), with the relevance of this information being higher in Portuguese (29.5 % vs. 8.5 %; p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Bing and ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy, while Bard showed the lowest accuracy in both diagnosis and treatment recommendations. However, the clinical application of these tools necessitates critical interpretation by dentists, as chatbot responses are not consistently reliable.}

However, empirical research on GenAI education approaches is scarce. This study investigates the prevalence of protective-preventive, critical-reflective, and creative-productive GenAI education approaches in highly digitized Swiss upper secondary schools and how students' experiences of these approaches relate to two aspects of their digital agency: GenAI confidence and GenAI responsibility. Using data from 2357 students, the results showed that the critical-reflective approach was the most commonly experienced and significantly predicted students’ GenAI confidence and responsibility. The creative-productive approach positively and significantly predicted GenAI confidence but not responsibility, while the protective-preventive approach, although the second most common approach, was not significantly related to either outcome. However, these approaches explained little variance in the dependent variables, suggesting that they may not yet be effectively implemented or that digital agency is primarily developed outside schools. Analysis of the control variables showed that identifying as a female had a negative significant effect on GenAI confidence and a positive significant effect on GenAI responsibility. The findings highlight the importance of adopting a critical-reflective GenAI education approach with attention to gender issues in fostering responsible and confident digital citizens.}

abstract = {Urban morphology, defined by the characteristics and spatial arrangement of urban structures, significantly affects urban microclimate in terms of thermal environments, wind dynamics, energy use, and outdoor air quality. Despite extensive research in this field, these effects are intensified by climate change and rapid urbanization, posing challenges to urban sustainability, such as poor air quality, increased energy demands, and pedestrian discomfort. While artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer promising solutions for addressing these challenges, the field lacks standardized approaches for implementing these technologies. By leveraging urban morphology indicators such as sky view factor, building density, and green space ratio, AI models can analyze complex interactions across various spatiotemporal scales. However, significant variability in methodologies, indicators, and datasets limits the generalizability and applicability of these techniques. By synthesizing 111 studies over the last decade utilizing urban morphology and AI models to predict urban microclimate, this review aims to bridge these gaps and highlight AI’s unique potential to contribute to the field. Analyzed studies reported that key urban morphology indicators, particularly building density and height, explain up to 75% of land surface temperature variance across seasons, while sky view factor accounts for over 67% of heat exposure variations in urban environments, with these findings emerging from multiple independent investigations across diverse urban contexts. Random Forest emerges as the most widely adopted AI technique, demonstrating robust performance across different applications. Emerging trends, such as hybrid approaches combining AI with physics-based models, are highlighted as promising avenues for advancing the field. Our review identifies the need for standardized frameworks and datasets to enhance model applicability. The study presents actionable insights for climate-responsive urban planning and lays the groundwork for interdisciplinary studies, enabling the development of resilient, sustainable urban environments amid the growing challenges of urbanization and climate change.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is used increasingly in point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). However, the true role, utility, advantages, and limitations of AI tools in POCUS have been poorly understood.
Aim
to conduct a scoping review on the current literature of AI in POCUS to identify (1) how AI is being applied in POCUS, and (2) how AI in POCUS could be utilized in clinical settings.
Methods
The review followed the JBI scoping review methodology. A search strategy was conducted in Medline, Embase, Emcare, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and AI POCUS manufacturer websites. Selection criteria, evidence screening, and selection were performed in Covidence. Data extraction and analysis were performed on Microsoft Excel by the primary investigator and confirmed by the secondary investigators.
Results
Thirty-three papers were included. AI POCUS on the cardiopulmonary region was the most prominent in the literature. AI was most frequently used to automatically measure biometry using POCUS images. AI POCUS was most used in acute settings. However, novel applications in non-acute and low-resource settings were also explored. AI had the potential to increase POCUS accessibility and usability, expedited care and management, and had a reasonably high diagnostic accuracy in limited applications such as measurement of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction, Inferior Vena Cava Collapsibility Index, Left-Ventricular Outflow Tract Velocity Time Integral and identifying B-lines of the lung. However, AI could not interpret poor images, underperformed compared to standard-of-care diagnostic methods, and was less effective in patients with specific disease states, such as severe illnesses that limit POCUS image acquisition.
Conclusion
This review uncovered the applications of AI in POCUS and the advantages and limitations of AI POCUS in different clinical settings. Future research in the field must first establish the diagnostic accuracy of AI POCUS tools and explore their clinical utility through clinical trials.}
