abstract = {Objective
To evaluate demographic representation in artificial intelligence (AI)–generated images of hospital leadership roles and compare them with real-world data from US hospitals.
Patients and Methods
This cross-sectional study, conducted from October 1, 2024 to October 31, 2024, analyzed images generated by 3 AI text-to-image models: Midjourney 6.0, OpenAI ChatGPT DALL-E 3, and Google Gemini Imagen 3. Standardized prompts were used to create 1200 images representing 4 key leadership roles: chief executive officers, chief medical officers, chief nursing officers, and chief financial officers. Real-world demographic data from 4397 US hospitals showed that chief executive officers were 73.2% men; chief financial officers, 65.2% men; chief medical officers, 85.7% men; and chief nursing officers, 9.4% men (overall: 60.1% men). The primary outcome was gender representation, with secondary outcomes including race/ethnicity and age. Two independent reviewers assessed images, with interrater reliability evaluated using Cohen κ.
Results
Interrater agreement was high for gender (κ=0.998) and moderate for race/ethnicity (κ=0.670) and age (κ=0.605). DALL-E overrepresented men (86.5%) and White individuals (94.5%). Midjourney showed improved gender balance (69.5% men) but overrepresented White individuals (75.0%). Imagen achieved near gender parity (50.3% men) but remained predominantly White (51.5%). Statistically significant differences were observed across models and between models and real-world demographics.
Conclusion
Artificial intelligence text-to-image models reflect and amplify systemic biases, overrepresenting men and White leaders, while underrepresenting diversity. Ethical AI practices, including diverse training data sets and fairness-aware algorithms, are essential to ensure equitable representation in health care leadership.}

Among others, these shifts introduce complex legal and regulatory challenges such as new frameworks for carbon accountability, data governance, and autonomous vessel operations. To assess educational alignment where these changes, the review follows a two-step approach: first, it draws on academic and policy literature to identify emerging technologies and the associated legal competencies needed to navigate their regulatory impact; second, it then evaluates the extent to which China’s maritime law curricula address these professional requirements. As this review aims to highlight, much scholarly and technical attention has been given to the operational and environmental dimensions of maritime innovation, there remains a professional skills gap – a disconnect between the competences now demanded by industry and those currently taught in legal education. Through comparative curriculum analysis, the paper highlights opportunities for Chinese institutions to proactively leapfrog integrate interdisciplinary legal training in areas such as maritime environmental governance, cybersecurity, and AI liability. The student concludes with a phased proposal for curriculum reform aimed at strengthening China’s legal capacity in the global maritime domain.}

abstract = {Background
The US healthcare system is currently facing significant challenges in quality, affordability, and labor shortages. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to transform healthcare delivery by making it safer, more effective, less wasteful, and more patient-centered. With more than $30 billion invested in healthcare AI companies in the past three years, the proliferation of AI solutions is expected to bring much-needed relief to the strained healthcare industry. To harness the current enthusiasm for AI in healthcare, we can draw parallels to the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) under the HITECH Act of 2009. EHR adoption has been widespread and has contributed to significant health information technology spending, but it has also brought unintended consequences, such as clinician burnout, workarounds, and mixed impacts on patient safety and quality measures.
The EHR Era vs. the AI Era: Differences
This article grounds the discussion by first reviewing the key differences between the EHR implementation era that followed the passage of HITECH and the current AI era. The authors identified three characteristics of the AI era that distinguish it from the EHR implementation era: different regulatory and legislative context, diminished capacity of the workforce to absorb new work, and an accelerated pace of change.
Lessons from EHR Implementation to Carry Forward to AI Implementation
Based on the collective experience of the authorship team and published literature on EHR and AI implementation, the authors identified five critical lessons from the EHR implementation era that organizations deploying AI must consider: (1) respect the human element, (2) build strong organizational governance, (3) adapt leadership and culture, (4) ready the workforce, and (5) build for the long term.
Conclusion
By applying these lessons, organizational leaders can realize the potential of AI to improve patient outcomes and transform healthcare delivery.}

This study investigated attitudes towards AI among Hong Kong middle-aged and older adults. In June 2023, an online survey was conducted among a sample of 740 smartphone users aged 45 years or older (Max = 78) in Hong Kong. Using exploratory factor analysis, we found three factors from the General Attitude to Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) - Perils, Power, and Promises. Subsequently, with latent profile analysis we revealed three latent profiles: (i) Enthusiasts (18.4%; high on Promises and Power but low on Perils); (ii) Skeptics (12.3%; high on Perils but low on Promises and Power), and (iii) Indecisive (69.3%; moderate on all three factors). The Enthusiasts were more likely to be male, with higher socio-economic status, better self-rated health, and greater mobile device proficiency, optimism, innovativeness, but also less insecurity with technology, compared to the Indecisive, and then to the Skeptics. Our findings suggest that most middle-aged and older adults in Hong Kong hold an ambivalent view towards AI, appreciating its power and potentials while also cognizant of the perils it may entail.

Reinforcement learning (RL) enables a decision maker (agent) to observe, learn, and select optimal actions within a dynamic environment over time. The combination of these two artificial intelligence approaches, referred to as GAN-RL, presents a powerful synergy that leverages their strengths while addressing their respective limitations. This paper provides the first comprehensive review that systematically examines GAN-RL, offering an in-depth analysis of its theoretical foundations, key methodologies, and diverse applications. Specifically, we categorize GAN-RL approaches based on five primary objectives: (a) generating comprehensive synthetic datasets for training; (b) minimizing the discrepancies between value (or cumulative reward) distributions, where the cumulative reward is defined as the total sum of rewards an agent accumulates over the course of its interactions with the environment; (c) predicting the next scenario; (d) predicting the gradient of the generator in discrete tasks; and (e) learning from demonstrations. Our analysis highlights how GAN-RL enhances system performance, including improvements in cumulative reward, convergence rate, and prediction accuracy. By identifying open challenges and future research directions, this review fills a critical gap in the literature and serves as a valuable resource for researchers exploring the intersection of GANs and RL.}

abstract = {Purpose
Technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), is transforming the way we work; however, it is yet to systemically transform learning at the workplace beyond augmentation of formal education’s learning processes. This paper derives functional requirements for technologies that support workplace learning and assesses the suitability and limitations of generative AI conversational agents, as an example of application.
Design/methodology/approach
Using activity theory (AT) as theoretical framework, we model workplace learning as an activity, intertwined with work and mediated by technology, and expose contradictions that arise when technology developed for formal education is adopted at work. From these tensions, we derive functional requirements and illustrate their use by comparing them to ChatGPT’s affordances.
Findings
A framework is proposed for design and assessment of enabling technologies for workplace learning. In applying it to ChatGPT, as paradigm of conversational agents, we find the aspects that are particularly suitable to enhance workplace learning, and those that need further development.
Originality/value
The theoretical approach is novel. Previous research is based on reported use-cases of enabling technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), in the workplace or on the analysis of the learner’s experience when these technologies are embedded in structured training modules. The present study addresses the limitations of current retrospective research, providing a forward-looking approach.}

Climate change and multifaceted energy crises necessitate resilient power systems for sustainable and smart energy transitions. However, correlations among energy efficiency, energy reliability, robustness, flexibility, and energy resilience remain unclear. This review employs bibliometric analysis to evaluate AI-driven solutions, particularly generative AI, in enhancing urban energy resilience. We quantify energy resilience metrics, as well as highlight the synergy among energy efficiency, energy reliability, robustness, flexibility, energy resilience with carbon neutrality, and multi-sector strategies across supply, demand, storage, and grid systems. The analysis demonstrates the capacity of AI to improve climate change adaptation during extreme events, illustrated as bio-inspired frameworks that emulate human self-regulation and self-healing. The integration of end-user participation and techno-economic-social benefits are emphasized. Big data technology facilitates information communications and inter-component interactions, while generative AI enables automatic city-scale information modeling and real-time decision-making.

The urgency for AI literacy is more critical than ever due to the potential unethical use of AI resulting from insufficient knowledge. This issue is particularly crucial for educators because they need to understand and adapt to the impact of AI within educational institutions, with some needing to use and become literate in AI, given that students now have increased access to public AI tools. This research presents a multi-phase study to address the issue of bridging the knowledge gap in AI by conducting co-creation with innovation champions, illustrated by a case of Generative AI innovation in a K-12 school. Using action design research, we engaged experienced teachers who are experts in pedagogical innovation to co-create a generative AI-enhanced platform at a leading K-12 education institution known for its pedagogical innovation in Australia. The findings reveal that champions enhance their knowledge through their subject-matter expertise, organizational knowledge, and AI knowledge gained through external exposure and experience. The study also highlights the key elements that facilitate a cross-domain knowledge exchange platform, enabling champions to be exposed to and experience AI technological learning, leading to shifts in their understanding and perception of AI. The initially unaware and sceptical champions become more aware and capable of articulating more technical AI knowledge rooted in a shared value. This research demonstrates how co-creation serves as a pathway for learning AI, particularly among K-12 teachers who are innovation champions. It underscores the impact of experiential and organizational learning on AI collaborative learning and behavioral intentions. Additionally, the study presents that aligning organizational and personal visions and values can influence perceptions about AI technologies, enhancing the discourse on AI and education innovation.}

However, most existing studies estimate a singular land value over large areas, lacking the fine-grained details for urban management. This study therefore develops a RAHGV (relative-to-absolute hybrid generative valuation) framework for regional land valuation, which combines a hybrid learning strategy with deep generative modeling to produce high-resolution, spatially continuous land value distribution across extensive urban areas. In a case study of New York City (NYC), the RAHGV model outperforms typical one-step models by differentiating between local land variations and broader regional tendencies. Its bi-attention bottleneck significantly improves model performance, reducing MAE (Mean Absolute Error) by 45.75% and MSE (Mean Squared Error) by 69.86% compared to conventional deep generative methods. Local physical infrastructure and mixed land-use patterns primarily influence micro-scale land values, while community amenities and economic vibrancy drive macro-scale values. The findings highlight the potential of the RAHGV framework as a powerful tool for promoting sustainable urban development by delivering high-resolution, data-driven insights that support informed decision-making in rapidly evolving urban environments.}

In addition, Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides new techniques and tools to both attackers and defenders such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based on Generators and Discriminators for impersonation or Deep Learning (DL) for exhaustive scanning. To address this dilemma, this article presents CyberAIBot: Artificial Intelligence in an Intrusion Detection System for CyberSecurity in the Internet of Things (IoT) aimed at Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) network traffic. CyberAIBot is based on a Deep Learning management structure in a private or local edge cloud computing approach where AI makes decisions as close as possible to the source of data. CyberAIBot gradually detects, learns, and adapts to different cyber attacks. In detail, CyberAIBot uses Deep Learning (DL) technical clusters trained in specific attacks and a Deep Learning (DL) management cluster specialises in taking management decisions rather than technical evaluations. This management cluster supervises conflicting classifications from the deep learning technical clusters. CyberAIbot is trained against several datasets and its performance is evaluated between two classification algorithms, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The SVM DL clusters learn faster (average 15x) although the LSTM DL clusters perform better (average 30%). The LSTM DL management cluster performs better than the SVM DL management cluster although it recognises fewer traffic types. The total number of data points analysed by CyberAIBot is 5.52E+08, equivalent to the distance between the planet Earth to the Moon in meters.}

Labor epidural analgesia is a widely used method for pain relief in childbirth, yet information accessibility for expectant mothers remains a challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots like Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and Google Gemini offer potential solutions for improving patient education. This study evaluates the accuracy, readability, and emotional tone of AI chatbot responses compared to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) online materials on labor epidurals.
Methods
Eight common questions about labor epidurals were posed to ChatGPT and Gemini. Seven obstetric anaesthesiologists evaluated the generated responses for accuracy and completeness on a 1–10 Likert scale, comparing them with ASA-sourced content. Statistical analysis (one-way ANOVA, Tukey HSD), sentiment analysis and readability metrics (Flesch Reading ease) were used to assess differences.
Results
ASA materials scored highest for accuracy (8.80 ± 0.40) and readability, followed by Gemini and ChatGPT. Completeness scores showed ASA and Gemini performing significantly better than ChatGPT (P <0.001). ASA materials were the most accessible, while Gemini content was more complex. Sentiment analysis indicated a neutral tone for ASA and Gemini, with ChatGPT displaying a less consistent tone.
Conclusion
AI chatbots exhibit promise in patient education for labor epidurals but require improvements in readability and tone consistency to enhance engagement. Further refinement of AI chatbots may support more accessible, patient-centred healthcare information.}

abstract = {The rapid advancements in natural language processing, particularly the development of generative large language models (LLMs), have renewed interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for judicial decision-making. While these technological breakthroughs present new possibilities for legal automation, they also raise concerns about over-reliance and automation bias. Drawing insights from the COMPAS case, this paper examines the implications of deploying generative LLMs in the judicial domain. It identifies the persistent factors that contributed to an accountability gap when AI systems were previously used for judicial decision-making. To address these risks, the paper analyses the relevant provisions of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, outlining a comprehensive accountability framework based on the regulation's risk-based approach. The paper concludes that the successful integration of generative LLMs in judicial decision-making requires a holistic approach addressing cognitive biases. By emphasising shared responsibility and the imperative of AI literacy across the AI value chain, the regulatory framework can help mitigate the risks of automation bias and preserve the rule of law.}

While its benefits for efficiency and productivity are widely acknowledged, its impact on employee well-being remains largely underexplored. This study investigates the relationship between GenAI adoption and three dimensions of employee well-being: emotional, social, and cognitive. Drawing on the job demands-resources (JD-R) model and social cognitive theory, we propose a conceptual framework in which the GenAI intensity of adoption mediates the relationship between employees’ attitudes toward the technology and their well-being. By analyzing survey data from approximately 130 knowledge workers and analyzing it through partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), our findings reveal that a positive attitude toward GenAI significantly enhances its adoption, whereas a negative attitude does not necessarily prevent usage. Furthermore, the extent of GenAI adoption influences all three dimensions of well-being, with team cohesion acting as a mediating factor. These results contribute to the literature on workplace well-being and technology adoption by offering theoretical and managerial insights into the complex relationship between AI integration and employee experience.}

Specifically, conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), which are generative models known for their creativity, were trained on a dataset consisting of 1437 fused deposition modelling (FDM) printed formulations that were extracted from both the literature and in-house data. In total, 27 different cGANs architectures were explored with varying learning rate, batch size and number of hidden layers parameters to generate 270 formulations. After a comparison between the characteristics of AI-generated and human-generated formulations, it was discovered that cGANs with a medium learning rate (10−4) could strike a balance in generating formulations that are both novel and realistic. Four of these formulations were fabricated using an FDM printer, of which the first AI-generated formulation was successfully printed. Our study represents a milestone, highlighting the capacity of AI to undertake creative tasks and its potential to revolutionize the drug development process.}

Objectives: Carbohydrate counting is a recommended approach for achieving glycemic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). This study aimed to compare the accuracy of carbohydrate content estimations for traditional Turkish fast foods made by AI models and dietitian. Methods: Children and adolescents with T1D were pretested to identify the 12 most preferred Turkish fast-food items. Standardized recipes were developed for these meals, and the meals were photographed under standardized angular and lighting conditions. The photos were then uploaded to AI applications (ChatGPT-4o, DeepSeek, Gemini, and CarbManager) and each model was prompted to estimate the carbohydrate content of the respective food items. Dietitians were asked to estimate the carbohydrate content based on these photographs. Results: Of the dietitians in the study (n=40), 50% had postgraduate education, and 17.5% of those providing carbohydrate counting education (n=20, 50.0%) had been doing so for more than 7 years. No significant difference was found between the carbohydrate estimates of dietitians who provided and those who did not provide carbohydrate counting training (p>0.05). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the AI models was 0.3554 (95% CI: 0.0974–0.6801), indicating low reliability. The highest agreement with the estimates of dietitians who provided carbohydrate counting training (ICC = 0.417, 95% CI: 0.247–0.685) and those who did not (ICC = 0.307, 95% CI: 0.163–0.578) was observed with ChatGPT. Conclusions: AI models can assist individuals with diabetes and healthcare professionals in estimating the carbohydrate content of foods, and consequently, can make a significant contribution to diabetes self-management.}

In studies employing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), model explanation, interpretation, and causality are often not clearly distinguished, leading to potential misunderstandings of model performance or relevance. For predictive AI models used in the natural sciences, the path leading from model explanation and interpretation to causal reasoning is of particular importance because it bridges theory and hypothesis-driven experimental design. Selected concepts from scientific theory can be taken into consideration to generate a conceptual framework for putting predictions into scientific perspective and recognizing potential caveats. For explainable models, it is argued that the scientific rationale underlying model derivation plays a decisive role in assessing and understanding predictions and exploring causal relationships, giving rise to the notion of model duality, as introduced herein.}

Artificial Intelligence, by answering questions about disease prevention strategies, can contribute to making diseases more treatable in their early stages.
Purpose
This study aims to evaluate the quality of patient information by assessing the responses of the Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT, Open AI, USA) artificial intelligence model to questions related to medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ).
Study Design, Setting, Sample
The study was prospective cross-sectional design. The study was conducted within the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The study's questions were prepared by an experienced oral and maxillofacial surgeon and directed to the artificial intelligence platform. The responses were evaluated by oral and maxillofacial surgeons using the Global Quality Scale (GQS).
Predictor Variable
The predictor variable is question type. A total of 120 questions were categorized into six groups, which encompassed general information about MRONJ (Group 1), queries from patients about to initiate medication therapy (Group 2), questions from patients currently undergoing medication treatment (Group 3), inquiries from patients who had completed medication usage (Group 4), general treatment-related information (Group 5), and case scenarios (Group 6).
Main Outcome Variables
The main variable is the GQS score. The GQS rates the quality of information and its utility for the patients. The scores are as follows: Score 1: Poor quality, Score 2: Generally poor quality, Score 3: Moderate quality, Score 4: Good quality, Score 5: Excellent quality.
Covariates
Not applicable.
Analyses
Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were applied for intragroup and intergroup analyses. The statistical significance level was determined as P < .05 and P < .01.
Results
The average score for all questions was calculated to be 3.9 ± 0.8, which is above the “moderate quality” threshold. Group 1 had a mean score of 3.4 ± 1.1; group 2 had 4.1 ± 0.7; group 3 had 3.8 ± 0.8; group 4 had 4.3 ± 0.6; group 5 had 4.2 ± 0.7; and group 6 had 4.1 ± 0.5. The variations in mean scores among these groups did not exhibit statistical significance (P > .05).
Conclusion and Relevance
The artificial intelligence model has generated responses of moderate quality to questions about MRONJ. The use of the artificial intelligence platform may assist in patients gaining a fundamental understanding of MRONJ.}

The internet, particularly social media, has become a popular resource for learning about health and investigating one's own health conditions. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots has been fueled by the increasing availability of digital health data and advances in natural language processing techniques. While these chatbots are more accessible than before, they sometimes fail to provide accurate information.
Methods
We used representative chatbots currently available (Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer-3.5, Bing Chat, and Google Bard) to answer questions commonly asked by brain tumor patients. The simulated situations with questions were made and selected by the brain tumor committee. These questions are commonly asked by brain tumor patients. The goal of the study was introduced to each chatbot, the situation was explained, and questions were asked. All responses were collected without modification. The answers were shown to the committee members, and they were asked to judge the responses while blinded to the type of chatbot.
Results
There was no significant difference in accuracy and communication ability among the 3 groups (P = 0.253, 0.090, respectively). For empathy, Bing Chat and Google Bard were superior to Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (P = 0.004, 0.002, respectively). The purpose of this study was not to assess or verify the relative superiority of each chatbot. Instead, the aim was to identify the shortcomings and changes needed if AI chatbots are to be used for patient medical purposes.
Conclusion
AI-based chatbots are a convenient way for patients and the general public to access medical information. Under such circumstances, medical professionals must ensure that the information provided to chatbot users is accurate and safe.}

As AI systems grow in size and complexity, ensuring interpretability and transparency becomes essential, especially in high-stakes applications. With the rapid expansion of XAI research, addressing emerging debates and criticisms requires a comprehensive examination. This paper explores the complexities of XAI from multiple perspectives, proposing six key axes that shed light on its role in human–AI interaction and collaboration. First, it examines the imperative of XAI under the dominance of black-box AI models. Given the lack of definitional cohesion, the paper argues that XAI must be framed through the lens of audience and understanding, highlighting its different uses in AI–human interaction. The recent BLUE vs. RED XAI distinction is analyzed through this perspective. The study then addresses the criticisms of XAI, evaluating its maturity, current trajectory, and limitations in handling complex problems. The discussion then shifts to explanations as a bridge between AI models and human understanding, emphasizing the importance of usability of explanations in human–AI decision making. Key aspects such as AI reliance, human intuition, and emerging collaboration theories — including the human-algorithm centaur and co-intelligence paradigms — are explored in connection with XAI. The medical field is considered as a case study, given its extensive research on collaboration between doctors and AI through explainability. The paper proposes a framework to evaluate the maturity of XAI using three dimensions: practicality, auditability, and AI governance. Provide the final lessons learned focused on trends and questions to tackle in the near future. This is an in-depth exploration of the impact and urgency of XAI in the era of pervasive expansion of AI. Three Key reflections from this study include: (a) XAI must enhance cognitive engagement with explanations, (b) it must evolve to fully address why, what, and for what purpose explanations are needed, and (c) it plays a crucial role in building societal trust in AI. By advancing XAI in these directions, we can ensure that AI remains transparent, auditable, and accountable, and aligned with human needs.}

In this paper, we model the effect of AI technologies on bilateral trade flows by introducing an AI shock to the production process and analyzing how this shock influences trade dynamics. We then empirically estimate the relationship between AI exposure and bilateral exports in recent years. Our findings reveal that AI has a significant positive correlation with trade: a one standard deviation increase in AI exposure is associated with a 31 percent rise in exports, on average. Additionally, we explore how this effect varies across trading partners, highlighting distinct patterns between advanced, emerging, and low-income economies.}

abstract = {Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare education; however, its integration into pharmacy curricula requires further exploration. This study aimed to explore the acceptance of AI-based technology in pharmacy education through the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework and identify opportunities for responsible integration via improved AI literacy.
Methods
A qualitative study was conducted at the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ulster University, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom, in April 2025. Eight MPharm students were recruited through purposive sampling, with two participants from each of the four academic years (Years 1–4) to ensure representation of developmental perspectives. Informed by the extended UTAUT framework, semi-structured interviews were conducted via Microsoft Teams. Thematic analysis was conducted using Braun and Clarke's six-phase approach, with data management performed using NVivo 13.
Results
Four major themes emerged from the analysis: (1) Current Understanding and Experience with AI Tools, (2) Perceived Benefits and Opportunities, (3) Challenges and Concerns, and (4) Recommendations for Responsible AI Integration. Students demonstrated a developmental progression in AI use, from basic concept clarification in the first year to complex clinical reasoning applications in senior years. Students primarily discovered AI tools through informal networks rather than formal academic channels. Key benefits included immediate conceptual clarification across multidisciplinary subjects, enhanced academic efficiency, and support for clinical preparation through simulated patient interactions. However, concerns were expressed regarding regional context limitations, accuracy and reliability issues, potential impacts on critical thinking development, uncertainties related to academic integrity, and affordability constraints for premium features.
Conclusion
The findings reveal that students resourcefully use AI tools to enhance learning but navigate considerable challenges, including information inaccuracies, ethical uncertainties, and concerns about adverse impacts on critical thinking skills. Future recommendations include establishing clear institutional policies, implementing formal AI literacy training, developing UK-centric pharmacy-specific AI tools, and adopting scaffolded curriculum integration approaches.}

Background
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is rapidly reshaping nursing roles, functions, and tasks. However, there is no established framework to guide understanding of how AI interacts with nursing practice.
Purpose
To propose a conceptual framework, grounded in sociotechnical systems theory and task-technology fit, that illustrates the potential of AI to augment, automate, and hybridize nursing work.
Methods
An exploratory review of literature across nursing, organizational theory, information systems, and management was conducted to identify patterns related to task characteristics, human–technology interaction, and organizational context.
Findings
The framework links AI interaction types (augmentation, automation, and hybridization) with task categories (manual, cognitive, and routine) and organizational factors. It demonstrates that routine tasks are more amenable to automation, while complex tasks are better suited to augmentation or hybridization, depending on how governance structures shape AI adoption.
Conclusion
This framework offers nurse leaders, educators, and clinicians a structured approach to anticipate AI’s impact on nursing practice, align workflows, support ethical implementation, and inform curricula that prepare nurses for evolving AI–clinical care dynamics.}

abstract = {Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for future wireless networks, aiming to improve communication efficiency by transmitting only the semantic meaning (or its encoded version) of the source data rather than the complete set of bits (symbols). However, traditional deep learning-based SemCom systems present challenges such as limited generalization, low robustness, and inadequate reasoning capabilities, primarily due to the inherently discriminative nature of deep neural networks. To address these limitations, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is seen as a promising solution, offering notable advantages in learning complex data distributions, transforming data between high- and low-dimensional spaces, and generating high-quality content. This paper explores the applications of GAI in SemCom and presents a comprehensive study. It begins by introducing three widely used SemCom systems enabled by classical GAI models: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. For each system, the fundamental concept of the GAI model, the corresponding SemCom architecture, and a literature review of recent developments are provided. Subsequently, a novel generative SemCom system is proposed, incorporating cutting-edge GAI technology—large language models (LLMs). This system features LLM-based artificial intelligence (AI) agents at both the transmitter and receiver, which act as “brains” to enable advanced information understanding and content regeneration capabilities, respectively. Unlike traditional systems that focus on bitstream recovery, this design allows the receiver to directly generate the desired content from the coded semantic information sent by the transmitter. As a result, the communication paradigm shifts from “information recovery” to “information regeneration,” marking a new era in generative SemCom. A case study on point-to-point video retrieval is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, showing a 99.98% reduction in communication overhead and a 53% improvement in average retrieval accuracy compared to traditional communication systems. Furthermore, four typical application scenarios for generative SemCom are described, followed by a discussion of three open issues for future research. In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive set of guidelines for applying GAI in SemCom, laying the groundwork for the efficient deployment of generative SemCom in future wireless networks.}

Nonetheless, by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), India can chase the United Nations' 2030 target. A major obstacle impeding India's initiatives is the stigma associated with TB. Although there has always been a stigma associated with TB, it is the socio-cultural underpinnings of TB which are particularly concerning. Beyond deterring patients from seeking medical help, stigma manifests into numerous repercussions-for instance, patients resort to their own problematic solutions which further worsen the disease. In cases where patients do seek medical care, they often fail to repose trust in caregivers, pay lesser attention to doctor's advice and do not turn up for follow-up appointments, thereby increasing the chances of recurrence. Here, AI can be a gamechanger. It can facilitate stigma mitigation and simultaneously provide treatment to the patient without apparent human intervention. With AI-integration, professional medical help can be delivered to patients via mobile Applications. Nonetheless, the burgeoning AI led technological developments have spurred a spectrum of ethical and legal concerns which require a critical examination. The judicious use of AI in healthcare warrants its deployment to augment human expertise rather than to replace or supplant it. In this context, this paper reviews the challenges and prospects of AI use in healthcare sector, particularly emphasizing on TB management and the associated stigma.

In this study, we aimed to identify and consolidate the existing evidence on the diagnostic performances of artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted tools for HPV-related HSILs. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy guidelines and systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE, and the Cochrane Library for eligible studies published between 2000 and January 2024. Studies on AI-assisted colposcopy used to facilitate the diagnosis of cervical or anal HSILs and cancers were included. The revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Studies 2 and AI checklists were used to assess the risk of bias. With random-effect models, meta-analyses were performed on performance indicators, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUC) curves. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed to identify the sources of heterogeneity. Twenty-five studies, comprising 21 studies focused on cervical cancer and 4 on anal cancer, were included in the meta-analysis. When differentiating from individuals with <CIN2/LSIL− (lesion grade lower than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or lower than or equal to low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion), the AI-assisted diagnostic tools identified individuals with CIN2+/HSIL+ (lesion grade ≥ CIN2 or ≥ high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) at a pooled accuracy of 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81–0.88), sensitivity of 0.87 (0.81–0.93), specificity of 0.85 (0.81–0.89), and AUC of 0.94 (0.91–0.96). For anal cancer, the AI-assisted diagnostic tools differentiated individuals with AIN2+/HSIL+ (≥AIN2 or ≥HSIL) from those with <AIN2/LSIL− (lesion grade < anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or ≤ LSIL) at a pooled accuracy of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.88–0.93), sensitivity of 0.90 (0.85–0.94), specificity of 0.88 (0.71–0.98), and AUC of 0.97 (0.95–0.98). All meta-analysis results demonstrated high heterogeneity (I2 > 90%), but the meta-regression analysis did not reveal any significant contributing sources of heterogeneity. Based on this systematic review of existing literature, we concluded that AI-assisted diagnostic tools have demonstrated promising predictive performance in diagnosing HPV-related cervical and anal precancerous lesions and cancers.}

abstract = {Introduction
Artificial intelligence has permeated all aspects of our existence, and medical imaging has shown the burgeoning use of artificial intelligence in clinical environments. However, there are limited empirical studies on radiography students' use of artificial intelligence for learning and assessment. Therefore, this study aimed to gain an understanding of this phenomenon.
Methods
The study used a qualitative explorative and descriptive research design. Data was obtained through five focus group interviews with purposively sampled undergraduate medical imaging and radiation science students at a single higher education institution in South Africa. Verbatim transcripts of the audio-recorded interviews were analysed thematically.
Results
Three themes and related subthemes were developed: 1) understanding artificial intelligence, 2) experiences with the use of artificial intelligence with the subthemes of the use of artificial intelligence in theoretical and clinical learning and challenges of using artificial intelligence, and 3) incorporation of artificial intelligence in undergraduate medical imaging and radiation sciences education with the subthemes of student education, ethical considerations and responsible use and curriculum integration of artificial intelligence in relation to learning and assessment.
Conclusion
Participants used artificial intelligence for learning and assessment by generating ideas to enhance academic writing, as a learning tool, finding literature, language translation and for enhanced efficiency. Simulation-based artificial intelligence supports students' clinical learning, and artificial intelligence within the clinical departments assists with improved patient outcomes. However, participants expressed concerns about the reliability and ethical implications of artificial intelligence-generated information. To address these concerns, participants suggested integrating artificial intelligence into medical imaging and radiation sciences education, where educators need to educate students on the responsible use of artificial intelligence in learning and consider artificial intelligence in assessments.
Implications for practice
The study findings contribute to understanding medical imaging and radiation sciences students’ use of artificial intelligence and may be used to develop evidence-based strategies for integrating artificial intelligence into the curriculum to enhance medical imaging and radiation sciences education and support students.}

Recent empirical studies in sensory and consumer science highlight the potential utility of GenAI in, for example, AI-generated food images and recipes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to propose a comprehensive framework for integrating GenAI into research and development in sensory and consumer science. The framework highlights how GenAI can be applied across the concept, design, and testing phases through an iterative process. The concept phase utilises GenAI to generate research concepts (e.g., proposing ideas such as research questions and hypotheses). The design phase employs GenAI to formulate research designs. During this stage, GenAI assists with creating and validating survey/experimental stimuli and measurement scales. The testing phase applies GenAI to evaluate research ideas and designs by employing “silicon samples,” interactive surveys that enhance engagement and response quality. In the testing phase, GenAI can also analyse unstructured text data, offering more accurate and scalable text analysis than traditional methods, even across diverse languages and cultures. This study also acknowledges potential pitfalls, such as biases in AI outputs, data privacy and security concerns, oversimplification, lack of transparency, and GenAI user misperception. This article encourages greater integration of GenAI by highlighting its potential for the sensory and consumer science community, while addressing its limitations and ensuring adherence to high ethical standards.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
Tumor hypoxia is linked to lower local control rates and increased distant disease progression during head and neck (HN) radiotherapy. 18F-fluoromisonidazole (18F-FMISO) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging measured hypoxia can aid dose selection for HN patients, but its availability is limited. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that an artificial intelligence (AI) model could synthesize 18F-FMISO-like images from routinely acquired 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET images in order to predict primary tumor or metastatic lymph node hypoxic volumes.
Materials and methods
One hundred and thirty-four (training = 84, validation = 13, testing = 21, additional testing = 16) HN carcinoma patients, treated with chemoradiotherapy between 2011 and 2018 and scanned at treatment baseline with 18F-FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) and 18F-FMISO dynamic PET/CT, were analyzed. A pix2pix-architecture-based generative adversarial network was trained to yield 2D voxel-wise FMISO hypoxia images of target-to-blood ratios (TBRs) directly from the 18F-FDG PET/CT image slices. The hypoxic volume was defined consistent with clinical procedure as the malignant volume with TBR values above 1.2. The AI model hypoxia predictions were compared against scaled 18F-FDG PET values.
Results
The AI model hypoxic volume predictions were well-correlated with 18F-FMISO hypoxic volumes on the held-out test subjects (Pearson correlation testing R = 0.96, additional testing R = 0.91, p < 0.001). Predictions from globally scaled 18F-FDG PET images also produced a significantly correlated but worse prediction.
Conclusion
Voxel-wise prediction of hypoxia for HN cancers from a 2D deep learning model using FDG-PET images as inputs was shown to be feasible. Testing on larger institutional and multi-institutional cohorts is required to establish generalizability.}

The AI/ML models have made inroads into Computer vision and Quantum computing due to their tremendous ability for reasoning and problem-solving. Computer vision allows computers to interpret visual information (photos, videos) similar to humans while Quantum computers execute complex tasks more efficiently than regular computers. However, how to explain the reasons for specific outputs is an important challenge with AI/ML models when applied to Computer vision and Quantum computing. Without the explainability of the AI/ML, the reliability and validity of Computer vision and Quantum computing outputs, when AI/ML is applied to them, is of great concern for researchers. To solve the issue of trustworthiness and transparency researchers have come up with the idea of explainable AI/ML (XAI). Therefore, to understand the extent of research on XAI in the area of Computer vision and Quantum computing, this study used the existing literature from the Scopus database and statistically presented the results. The study has found that the research on XAI in Computer vision and Quantum computing has been growing particularly since 2019. For AI/ML in Computer vision, the maximum studies on the XAI are in the healthcare sector accounting for 57% followed by autonomous vehicles. As far as AI/ML in Quantum computing is concerned, the majority of XAI research is related to the healthcare sector accounting for 46% followed by cyber security (20%).}

abstract = {The main drawback of traditional ecological models is the inability to model local interactions between individuals. As a consequence, it was impossible to mathematically model individual-based mechanisms of direct and indirect competition, which hampers the understanding of ecological dynamics. To overcome this problem, we developed a fully transparent mechanistic analog of the classical Lotka-Volterra phenomenological model based on explicitly explainable artificial intelligence (AI) of the glass-box type. In this paper, on an individual-based model, we present (i) a rigorous mechanism of inverted competitive exclusion where, all else being equal, the weaker species in direct competition defeats the stronger species through indirect exploitative competition and (ii) a rigorous mechanism of coexistence of complete competitors resulting from a combination of accounting for microhabitat regeneration, moderate reproduction, a certain habitat size and boundary conditions. Both presented mechanisms go beyond the classical formulations of the competitive exclusion principle, as in our model two species with different competitiveness compete for a single limiting resource in one homogeneous bounded ecosystem. We have shown that individual-based modeling of direct and indirect competition mechanisms allows for a more detailed understanding of the causal mechanisms of interspecific competition. Such understanding is necessary to refine formulations of the competitive exclusion principle, to search for mechanisms of competitive coexistence, to predict ecosystem behavior, and to develop conservation strategies. Our approach allows us to study discrete systems with fundamentally discrete mathematics, which opens up new opportunities for achieving accuracy, clarity, rigor, and explainability in studies of complex systems.}

abstract = {Background
Pharmaceutical manufacturers address health care professionals’ information needs through scientific response documents (SRDs), offering evidence-based answers to medication and disease state questions. Medical information departments, staffed by medical experts, develop SRDs that provide concise summaries consisting of relevant background information, search strategies, clinical data, and balanced references. With an escalating demand for SRDs and the increasing complexity of therapies, medical information departments are exploring advanced technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) tools like large language models (LLMs) to streamline content development. While AI and LLMs show promise in generating draft responses, a synergistic approach combining an LLM with traditional machine learning classifiers in a series of human-supervised and -curated steps could help address limitations, including hallucinations. This will ensure accuracy, context, traceability, and accountability in the development of the concise clinical data summaries of an SRD.
Objective
This study aims to quantify the challenges of SRD development and develop a framework exploring the feasibility and value addition of integrating AI capabilities in the process of creating concise summaries for an SRD.
Methods
To measure the challenges in SRD development, a survey was conducted by phactMI, a nonprofit consortium of medical information leaders in the pharmaceutical industry, assessing aspects of SRD creation among its member companies. The survey collected data on the time and tediousness of various activities related to SRD development. Another working group, consisting of medical information professionals and data scientists, used AI to aid SRD authoring, focusing on data extraction and abstraction. They used logistic regression on semantic embedding features to train classification models and transformer-based summarization pipelines to generate concise summaries.
Results
Of the 33 companies surveyed, 64% (21/33) opened the survey, and 76% (16/21) of those responded. On average, medical information departments generate 614 new documents and update 1352 documents each year. Respondents considered paraphrasing scientific articles to be the most tedious and time-intensive task. In the project’s second phase, sentence classification models showed the ability to accurately distinguish target categories with receiver operating characteristic scores ranging from 0.67 to 0.85 (all P<.001), allowing for accurate data extraction. For data abstraction, the comparison of the bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score and semantic similarity in the paraphrased texts yielded different results among reviewers, with each preferring different trade-offs between these metrics.
Conclusions
This study establishes a framework for integrating LLM and machine learning into SRD development, supported by a pharmaceutical company survey emphasizing the challenges of paraphrasing content. While machine learning models show potential for section identification and content usability assessment in data extraction and abstraction, further optimization and research are essential before full-scale industry implementation. The working group’s insights guide an AI-driven content analysis; address limitations; and advance efficient, precise, and responsive frameworks to assist with pharmaceutical SRD development.}

abstract = {Objectives
Diabetes remains a major global health challenge in China. Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in improving diabetes management. This study aimed to assess healthcare providers’ perceptions regarding AI in diabetes care across China.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted using snowball sampling from November 12 to November 24, 2024. We selected 514 physicians and nurses by a snowball sampling method from healthcare providers across 30 cities or provinces in China. The self-developed questionnaire comprised five sections with 19 questions assessing medical workers’ demographic characteristics, AI-related experience and interest, awareness, attitudes, and concerns regarding AI in diabetes care. Statistical analysis was performed using t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and linear regression.
Results
Among them, 20.0 % and 48.1 % of respondents had participated in AI-related research and training, while 85.4 % expressed moderate to high interest in AI training for diabetes care. Most respondents reported partial awareness of AI in diabetes care, and only 12.6 % exhibited a comprehensive or substantial understanding. Attitudes toward AI in diabetes care were generally positive, with a mean score of 24.50 ± 3.38. Nurses demonstrated significantly higher scores than physicians (P < 0.05). Greater awareness, prior AI training experience, and higher interest in AI training in diabetes care were strongly associated with more positive attitudes (P < 0.05). Key concerns regarding AI included trust issues from AI-clinician inconsistencies (77.2 %), increased workload and clinical workflow disruptions (63.4 %), and incomplete legal and regulatory frameworks (60.3 %). Only 34.2 % of respondents expressed concerns about job displacement, indicating general confidence in their professional roles.
Conclusions
While Chinese healthcare providers show moderate awareness of AI in diabetes care, their attitudes are generally positive, and they are considerably interested in future training. Tailored, role-specific AI training is essential for equitable and effective integration into clinical practice. Additionally, transparent, reliable, ethical AI models must be prioritized to alleviate practitioners’ concerns.}

Objectives
Can conversational artificial intelligence (AI) help alleviate orthodontic patients’ general doubts? This study aimed to investigate the performance of conversational AI in answering frequently asked questions (FAQs) from orthodontic patients, with comparison to orthodontists.
Materials and Methods
Thirty FAQs were selected covering the pre-, during-, and postorthodontic treatment stages. Each question was respectively answered by AI (Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer [ChatGPT]-4) and two orthodontists (Ortho. A and Ortho. B), randomly drawn out of a panel. Their responses to the 30 FAQs were ranked by four raters, randomly selected from another panel of orthodontists, resulting in 120 rankings. All the participants were Chinese, and all the questions and answers were conducted in Chinese.
Results
Among the 120 rankings, ChatGPT was ranked first in 61 instances (50.8%), second in 35 instances (29.2%), and third in 24 instances (20.0%). Furthermore, the mean rank of ChatGPT was 1.69 ± 0.79, significantly better than that of Ortho. A (2.23 ± 0.79, P < 0.001) and Ortho. B (2.08 ± 0.79, P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between the two orthodontist groups. Additionally, the Spearman correlation coefficient between the average ranking of ChatGPT and the inter-rater agreement was 0.69 (P < 0.001), indicating a strong positive correlation between the two variables.
Conclusions
Overall, the conversational AI ChatGPT-4 may outperform orthodontists in addressing orthodontic patients’ FAQs, even in a non-English language. In addition, ChatGPT tends to perform better when responding to questions with answers widely accepted among orthodontic professionals, and vice versa.}

This meta-analysis evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT)-based artificial intelligence (AI) in detecting lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer patients.
Methods
A thorough literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify studies on the diagnostic accuracy of CT-based AI in detecting lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer patients, with a deadline of September 2024. The analysis assessed the performance of AI algorithms in detection through CT imaging. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a bivariate random-effects model, reported with 95% confidence intervals. Study heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 statistic to account for heterogeneity among the included studies.
Results
Seven studies were included in this meta-analysis. The internal test set contained 23 contingency tables, while the radiologists' data included 19 contingency tables. AI’s pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were 0.84 (0.79–0.87), 0.77 (0.66–0.85), and 0.88 (0.16–1.00), respectively. Radiologists had pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 0.80 (0.72–0.86), 0.54 (0.46–0.63), and 0.72 (0.11–0.98). Funnel plot analysis showed P values of 0.13 for AI and 0.40 for radiologists, indicating that no publication bias was observed.
Conclusions
CT-based AI demonstrates superior specificity over radiologists for LNM detection in rectal cancer, However, significant heterogeneity across studies and limited external test of existing models warrant further multicenter test studies before clinical implementation.}

Hand injuries are a frequent reason for an emergency department visit and require a radiographic analysis. Misdiagnosed or undiagnosed injuries may lead to poor functional outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) is providing new tools for the diagnosis of injuries in routine clinical practice. The primary objective of the present study was to assess the diagnostic performance of AI in the diagnosis of hand fractures and dislocations, when compared with reviews by two experienced hand surgeons. The secondary objective was to assess the diagnostic performance of a resident vs. the AI.
Hypothesis
On the basis of standard radiographs, the AI system would diagnose metacarpal and phalangeal fractures and dislocations with the same level of diagnostic accuracy (i.e. sensitivity and specificity) as senior hand surgeons.
Patients and methods
This single-centre, retrospective study was conducted on hand radiography datasets collected from consecutive patients over the age of 16 consulting in an emergency department. The radiographic data were reviewed by two senior hand surgeons (constituting the gold standard) and a resident. Based on a contingency table, sensitivity, and specificity, the AI’s and resident’s respective abilities to detect fracture/dislocation were compared with the gold standard. The resident and the AI were also compared.
Results
1915 radiographic datasets (4738 X-rays for 1892 patients) were included in the analysis. The Cohen’s kappa of 0.865 indicated almost perfect agreement between the two senior surgeons. The AI’s analysis yielded a sensitivity [95% confidence interval] of 97.6% [0.96−0.98] and a specificity of 88.9% [87.2−90.4]. False positives were noted in 162 cases. The AI failed to diagnose 11 injuries (0.6%): two dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint, seven fractures of the phalanx (including one third phalanx amputation and two metacarpal fractures). Relative to the AI, the resident's analysis yielded a significantly lower sensitivity (p < 0.0001) and a significantly higher specificity (p = 0.007).
Conclusion
An AI may be a valuable tool in emergency settings - especially for less experienced practitioners - but does not surpass the diagnostic performance of senior surgeons. The AI's ability to detect dislocations and amputations must be improved. An AI can complement (but not replace) a thorough clinical examination.

Purpose
This study aims to systematically synthesize the practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in patent analysis by constructing a comprehensive matrix that aligns distinct AI techniques with their corresponding analytical tasks. The “AI Technique and Analytical Task” matrix provides a structured framework for understanding how various AI approaches are deployed across different functional objectives within the patent analysis domain.
Design/methodology/approach
This study integrates bibliometric analysis, BERT-based topic modeling, and literature review to explore AI applications in patent analysis. Data were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection using a dual-focus search strategy targeting AI techniques and patent analysis tasks. A clear distinction was made to exclude studies analyzing AI trends using patent data, retaining only those applying AI methods to patent analytics. With these strategies, 718 relevant publications were selected as the basis for analysis.
Findings
The results reveal exponential growth in AI-powered patent analysis research since the mid-2010s, with Technological Forecasting and Social Change (TFSC), Scientometrics, and World Patent Information (WPI) identified as the leading publication platforms. Geographical analysis shows that China and South Korea have rapidly increased their research output and institutional engagement, while the U.S. maintains a foundational yet less recent presence. With topic modeling technique, this study identified eleven major thematic clusters, spanning tasks such as emerging knowledge discovery, technology forecasting, and opportunity identification. These were integrated into “AI Technique and Analytical Task” matrix, which systematically maps the relationships between AI methods (such as pretrained language models, convolutional neural networks, semantic analysis, and topic modeling) and their practical implementations. Among these, patent classification and nature language processing (NLP) emerged as the most impactful applications, underscoring AI's vital role in enabling scalable, data-driven approaches to managing complex patent information.
Originality
This study presents a novel integration of multi-layered literature retrieval strategies, bibliometric analysis, BERT-based topic modeling, and an AI technique-to-analytical task matrix to construct a systematic and structured knowledge framework. This integrative approach not only delineates the interdisciplinary evolution of AI applications in patent analysis but also provides strategic guidance for future research, particularly in advancing empirical validation, informing policy applications, and promoting global inclusivity in this emerging field.}

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia worldwide, characterized by heterogeneous neuropathological changes and progressive cognitive decline. Despite the numerous studies, there are still no effective treatments beyond those that aim to slow progression and compensate the impairment. Neuroimaging techniques provide a comprehensive view of brain changes, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) playing a key role due to its non-invasive nature and wide availability. The T1-weighted MRI sequence is frequently used due to its prevalence in most MRI protocols, generating large datasets, ideal for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, has been increasingly utilized to model these datasets and classify individuals along the AD continuum. This systematic review evaluates studies using AI to classify more than two stages of AD based on T1-weighted MRI data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most widely applied, achieving an average classification accuracy of 85.93 % (range: 51.80–100 %; median: 87.70 %). These good results are due to CNNs' ability to extract hierarchical features directly from raw imaging data, reducing the need for extensive preprocessing. Non-convolutional neural networks and traditional ML approaches also demonstrated strong performance, with mean accuracies of 82.50 % (range: 57.61–99.38 %; median: 86.67 %) and 84.22 % (range: 33–99.10 %; median: 87.75 %), respectively, underscoring importance of input data selection. Despite promising outcomes, challenges remain, including methodological heterogeneity, overfitting risks, and a reliance on the ADNI database, which limits dataset diversity. Addressing these limitations is critical to advancing AI's clinical application for early detection, improved classification, and enhanced patient outcomes.}

abstract = {Background
The use of multiple medications increases the risk of harmful drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Conventional DDI screening databases vary in coverage and often trigger low-relevance alerts, contributing to alert fatigue. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as potential tools for DDI identification, however, their performance compared to established databases using real-world patient data remains under-explored.
Methods
In this exploratory study, we compared conventional database screening with LLM-based screening using anonymized medication lists from rheumatology patients. Lexicomp, Medscape and Drugs.com were used to compile a reference set of 204 clinically relevant interactions across 57 cases. Using identical prompts, we then queried ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot for interactions potentially requiring pharmacists' intervention. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1 score.
Results
Compared to the reference set of 204 DDIs, ChatGPT identified 439, Gemini 1556, and Copilot 1813 potential interactions. While Gemini achieved the highest sensitivity (0.697), ChatGPT demonstrated higher specificity (0.868). All three platforms demonstrated low precision scores. Overall, ChatGPT achieved the highest performance by F1 score (0.2520), followed by Gemini (0.1933) and Copilot (0.1153). Our results suggest that no AI systems assessed achieve the required balance of precision and sensitivity for reliable clinical decision-making in DDI screening.
Conclusion
Although LLMs show promise as complementary tools in DDI screening, as they proved effective in identifying true interactions, they generate clinically inaccurate information due to hallucinations, which limits their reliability as standalone screening tools. Consequently, while LLMs could support clinical pharmacists in polypharmacy management, their outputs must always undergo professional validation to ensure patient safety.}

abstract = {Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) represent a group of heterogeneous mesenchymal tumors of which are generally classified as per the histopathology. Despite being rare in incidence and prevalence, STSs are usually correlated with unfavorable prognosis and high mortality rate. Early and accurate diagnosis of STSs are critical in clinical management of STSs. Deep learning (DL) refers to a subtype of artificial intelligence that has been adopted to assist healthcare professionals to optimize personalized treatment for a given situation, particularly in image analysis. Recently, emerging studies have demonstrated that application of DL based on medical images could substantially improve the accuracy and efficiency of clinicians to the identification, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis prediction of STSs, and thereby facilitating the clinical decision-making. Herein, we aimed to extensively summarize the recent applications of DL-based artificial intelligence in STSs from the aspects of data acquisition, algorithm, and model establishment. Besides, the reinforcement of the model by transfer learning and generative adversarial network (GAN) for data augmentation has also been elaborated. It is worth noting that high-quality data with accurate annotations, as well as optimized algorithmic performance are pivotal in the clinical application of DL in STSs.}
