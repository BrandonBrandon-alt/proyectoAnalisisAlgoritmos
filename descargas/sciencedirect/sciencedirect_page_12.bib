But the flourishing communication about AI makes it more difficult to understand what AI actually is and what role AI takes in society. From a systems theory perspective, we propose that to understand AI is to understand how societal subsystems deal with AI. To investigate the different constructions of AI we use text mining methods on the discursive structure, the semantics, and their trends over the past 20 years. We compare two subsystems – science and mass media – with getting insights from two databases – OpenAlex and Wikipedia. In science, AI is a computer science topic, consisting of four main strands: computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and machine learning. AI as a research topic appears as a driver of scientific development that underlies machine learnization. AI as a media and broadcasting topic on Wikipedia is stable and concentrates on science, big technological firms, and science fiction. The respective pages are oriented towards the perspective of everyday life and range from personal assistance systems over sci-fi franchises to philosophical currents. We diagnose a trend from speculation to application in the attention AI receives on Wikipedia. Other systems like polity, law, or social movements do not play (at the moment) an important role in either system. Taken together, the trends point to a peculiar divergence between exaggerated expectations, everyday applications and societal debates about potentials, limits, and challenges.}

However, fully depicting the vast mosaic of concepts and applications in environmental sciences and ecology often entails a substantial workload. New Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools present an attractive option for addressing this challenge but require sufficient validation to match the vigorous standards of a systematic review. This article demonstrates the use of generative AI in the selection of relevant literature as part of a systematic review on indicators of ecosystem condition. We highlight, through the development of an optimal prompt to communicate inclusion and exclusion criteria, the need to describe ecosystem condition as a multidimensional concept whilst also maintaining clarity on what does not meet the criteria of comprehensiveness. We show that, although not completely infallible, the GPT-3.5 model significantly outperforms traditional literature screening processes in terms of speed and efficiency whilst correctly selecting 83 % of relevant literature for review. Our study highlights the importance of precision in prompt design and the setting of query parameters for the AI model and opens the perspective for future work using language models to contextualize complex concepts in the environmental sciences. Future development of this methodology in tandem with the continued evolution of the accessibility and capacity of AI tools presents a great potential to improve evidence synthesis through gains in efficiency and possible scope.}

This study evaluates the clinical benefits of AI-assisted prostate biopsy (PB) diagnosis, with Paige Prostate tool, compared to non-AI-assisted PB diagnosis, focusing on its predictive accuracy for features in radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens. A retrospective analysis included 55 patients divided into two cohorts: one with non-AI-assisted PB diagnosis (n = 25) and another with AI-assisted PB diagnosis (n = 30). Pathological assessments recorded tumor size, Gleason score, Grade Group, and perineural invasion. The correlation between PB and RP results was analyzed, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. AI-assisted PB diagnosis showed faster reporting times by 24 hours, enhancing workflow efficiency. AI assistance improved the correlation of tumor size between PB and RP, showing a substantial agreement (R=0.646, p < 0.001) compared to non-AI (R=0.479, p = 0.015). Gleason Score concordance increased by 13 % in the AI-assisted group, achieving 73.3 % versus 60 % in the non-AI-assisted group. This small pilot study suggests that AI-assisted PB diagnosis appears to enhance efficiency and accuracy in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, a finding to be confirmed with further studies.}

Overcrowding and long wait times in emergency departments (EDs) remain global challenges that negatively affect patient outcomes and staff satisfaction. As an emerging technology, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential to optimize ED operations and reduce wait times.
Objective
Establish a strategy to evaluate AI modeling as it relates to utilizing AI based strategies for ED flow.
Methods
We searched Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Scopus for English-language studies published from January 1, 1946, to August 17, 2023, and we will update our search to ensure currency. The ROBINS-I tool assessed study quality, while PROBAST examined the risk of bias and applicability.
Results
Out of 17,569 screened studies, 65 full-text articles were evaluated for eligibility, with 16 quantitative observational studies meeting inclusion criteria. The best-performing algorithms included regression-based methods (n = 2), traditional single-model machine learning (n = 8), neural networks/deep learning (n = 3), natural language processing (n = 1), and ensemble methods (n = 2). None of the studies examined AI’s impact in a real ED setting, though four simulations reported wait-time reductions ranging from 7 to 43.2 minutes.
Conclusions
AI integration in ED is still in its infancy. Our review found no real-world ED implementation studies, and most of the existing research lacked involvement from ED experts. This gap highlights the lack of insight into AI’s practical impact. Future reviews and research must clarify these dimensions, guiding AI's effective, collaborative adoption in ED workflows.}

This editorial examines the “elephant in the room”: the integration of AI across every stage of the research life cycle and publication pipeline. We trace AI’s expanding footprint on the author side, from sparking novel research ideas, mapping literature, and designing studies, to simulating data, analyzing results, and drafting manuscripts. We also consider AI’s growing role on the journal side, including automated manuscript triage, AI-assisted peer review, decision synthesis, and revision checks. And we discuss AI’s impact on research dissemination. Throughout, we highlight not only the unprecedented opportunities for creativity, efficiency, and accessibility, but also the ethical risks, such as epistemic homogenization, challenges to accountability, and the loss of scholarly craft. We urge researchers, editors, and institutions not to fall into the false binary of blind optimism or blanket skepticism. Instead, we call for deliberate engagement: a principled, transparent, and reflexive partnership between human scholars and machine collaborators. The question is no longer whether we want AI to shape the future of scholarship—it already is. The challenge now is to ensure that what it amplifies is not only our productivity, but our judgment, imagination, and collective responsibility in knowledge creation and dissemination.}

Here, the authors describe how models of machine learning like random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) can be used to predict degradation efficiency under pH, light intensity, and catalyst loading conditions in particular. Methods like transfer learning improve model generalizability to systems. AI also enables the identification of new photocatalysts and reduces the necessity for large-scale experimental screening. Hybridization of kinetic models like Langmuir-Hinshelwood with ML enables more stringent predictions at realistic, complex conditions. Additional explainability methods like SHAP and Grad-CAM enable a window into model decision-making, which can inform experimental design. Scripting sensors and reinforcement learning can enable AI to dynamically control and monitor photocatalytic reactors in real time and optimize in real time catalyst concentration, flow rate, and light intensity. AI-efficient reactors are energy-saving and cost-effective, and are capable of degrading up to 99 %. Scaling down the system is not feasible because of the complexity of real effluents and limited information.

Overall, a significantly growing interest in applying AI methods can be observed across all research areas. However, noticeable differences exist between the three topics. While CV and DL techniques are applied to image data in research on the architectural design of facades, research on environmental aspects of facades often uses numerical data with relatively small datasets and classical ML models. Research on facade structure also tends to use image data but also incorporates numerical performance prediction. A major limitation remains a lack of generalizability, which could be addressed by more comprehensive datasets and novel DL techniques. These include concepts such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks, where domain knowledge is integrated into hybrid data-driven models, and multi-modal diffusion models, which offer generative modeling capabilities to support inverse and forward design tasks. The trends and directions outlined in this review suggest that AI will continue to advance facade research and, in line with other domains, has the potential to achieve a level of maturity suitable for adoption beyond academia and into practice.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study mapped the editorial policies regarding the use and acknowledgment of artificial intelligence (AI) in dental journals.
Methods
Dental journals indexed in Web of Science were analyzed. Editorial guidelines and instructions for authors and reviewers were assessed. The outcome of interest was whether a journal reported an AI policy. Exposures of interest were Journal Impact Factor (JIF), Journal Citation Indicator (JCI), total number of citations, and percentage of open access content. Associations between journal metrics and the presence of AI policies were assessed using Poisson regression models with robust standard errors. Adjusted models were developed separately for JIF and JCI, including variables with p ≤ 0.2. Significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.
Results
Among the 158 journals analyzed, 70.9 % reported AI policies. Policies targeted authors (100 %), reviewers (88.4 %), and editors (46.4 %). The most common areas addressed were authorship, language review, and writing assistance. Journals in the upper quartiles of JIF and JCI were about twice as likely to report an AI policy compared to those in the lowest quartile. In the adjusted models, no association was found between total citations and AI policy presence, whereas open access percentage showed a negative association. While AI tools are permitted to aid in language refinement, critical tasks were consistently required to remain human-led, with rare exceptions.
Conclusion
AI-related editorial policies were frequent in dental journals, and higher-impact journals were statistically more likely to report such policies.
Clinical significance
Clearer and more standardized AI policies may promote transparency and ethical AI use.}

Children's voice and communication abilities evolve with age, necessitating tailored protocols for accurate analysis. Distinct vocal properties and communication styles across developmental stages require specific tasks. The absence of standardized pediatric protocols impedes reliable voice data collection, limits robust acoustic measurements, and hinders AI-driven voice research. This study aims to develop age-specific voice data collection protocols, creating a pediatric voice database to advance research and enhance AI applications.
Methods
Protocols were developed iteratively over six months through a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional team involving speech-language pathologists and otolaryngologists. A comprehensive literature review was completed. Emphasis was placed on designing protocols capable of generating high-quality, consistent data for AI modeling while minimizing measurement variability.
Results
Four developmentally appropriate protocols were created for children aged 2 to <4 years, 4 to <6 years, 6 to <10 years, and 10+ years respectively. Each protocol targeted key acoustic parameters while aligning with the linguistic and cognitive abilities of the respective age group. The iterative design incorporated tasks that engaged children while ensuring clinically robust data collection. Standardized protocols were deployed via a user-friendly iPad application, using child-sized headset microphones at fixed distances from the mouth. The protocols were administered to 100 pediatric patients in an otolaryngology clinic between the ages of 2–18.
Conclusions
The development of age specific protocols aims to standardize the collection of pediatric voice and acoustic sound data, which will serve as a valuable resource for advancing artificial intelligence applications within clinical sciences. Future validation will ensure feasibility, adherence, and reliability of data collection to support AI-driven innovations.}

It is crucial to shield the window from direct sunlight while allowing as much natural light as possible. The mismatch between two desirable/undesirable effects of sun radiation penetration necessitated the application of simulation techniques to determine which shading element is best for a certain structure. This also addresses the intricate linkages between the complex factors of climate, occupancy requirements, mechanical and electrical systems, energy efficiency issues, and design characteristics. Over the past several years, there has been a significant increase in the number of research articles on shading devices, reflecting advancements in the implementation of technical methods in the field.

The device demonstrated synaptic behavior under optoelectronic hybrid stimulation (largest wavelength ∼520 nm), such as excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM). Notably, the “light writing and voltage erasing” characteristics of these devices could be utilized to construct a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for the CIFAR-10 dataset, demonstrating noise tolerance close to the human eye. The loss in recognition accuracy was within 1 % when Gaussian white noise and salt pepper noise were added. Furthermore, these devices exhibited great potential in cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN), with the generated image quality achieving levels of 0.637 and 0.715 in improved perceptual image processing system (IPIPS) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) evaluation metrics for the zebra dataset, indicating good image quality.

While XAI can help to partially interpret and explain the workings of neural networks, it has not changed their original subsymbolic nature and the opaque statistical nature of their workings. Significant uncertainties remain about the safety, reliability, and accountability of modern neural network AI solutions. Here we present a novel AI method that has a fully transparent white-box nature - eXplicitly eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XXAI). XXAI is implemented on deterministic cellular automata whose rules are based on first principles of the problem domain. XXAI overcomes the limitations for a broader application of symbolic AI. The practical value of XXAI lies in its ability to make autonomous, fully transparent decisions due to its multi-component, multi-level, networked, hyper-logical nature. Looking ahead, XXAI has the potential to become a leading strategic partner in the field of neuro-symbolic hybrid AI systems. XXAI is able to systematically validate neural network solutions, ensuring that the required standards of reliability, security and ethics are met throughout the AI lifecycle, from training to deployment. By creating a clear cognitive framework, XXAI will enable the development of advanced autonomous solutions to achieve the human-centric values of the future Industry 5.0.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasing being deployed across various sectors in society. While bringing progress and promise to scientific discovery, public administration, healthcare, transportation and human well-being generally, artificial intelligence can also exacerbate existing forms of human vulnerabilities and can introduce new vulnerabilities through the interplay of AI inferences, predictions and content that is generated. This underpins the anxiety of policymakers in terms of managing potential harms and vulnerabilities and the harried landscape of governance and regulatory modalities, including through the European Union’s effort to be the first in the world to comprehensively regulate AI. This article examines the adequacy of the existing theories of human vulnerability in countering the challenges posed by artificial intelligence, including through how vulnerability is theorised and addressed within human rights law and within existing legislative efforts such as the EU AI Act. Vulnerability is an element that informs the contours of groups and populations that are protected, for example under non-discrimination law and privacy law. A critical evaluation notes that while human vulnerability is taken into account in governing and regulating AI systems, the vulnerability lens that informs legal responses is one that is particularistic, static and identifiable. In other words, the law demands that vulnerabilities are known in advance in order for meaningful parameters of protection to be designed around them. The individual, as the subject of legal protection, is also expected to be able to identify the harms suffered and therein seek for accountability. However, AI can displace this straightforward framing and the legal certainty that implicitly underpins how vulnerabilities are dealt with under the law. Through data-driven inferential insights of predictive AI systems and content generation enabled by general purpose AI models, novel forms of dynamic, unforeseeable and emergent forms of vulnerability can arise that cannot be adequately encompassed within existing legal responses. Instead, it requires an expansion of not only the types of legal responses offered but also of vulnerability theory itself and the measures of resilience that should be taken to address the exacerbation of existing vulnerabilities and but also of emergent ones. The article offers a re-theorisation of human vulnerability in the age of AI as one informed by the universalist idea of vulnerability theorised by Martha Fineman. A new conceptual framework is offered, through an expanded understanding that sketches out the human condition in this age as one of ‘algorithmic vulnerability.’ It finds support for this new condition through a vector of convergence from the growing vocabularies of harm, the regulatory direction and drawing from scholarship on emerging vulnerabilities. The article proposes the framework of multi-level resilience to account for existing and emerging vulnerabilities. It offers a typology, examining how resilience towards vulnerabilities can be operationalised at the level of the individual, through technological design and within regulatory initiatives and other measures that promote societal resilience. The article also addresses objections to this new framing, namely in terms of how it seemingly results in a problem with no agency, potentially negating fault ascription and blame. Further, it addresses if the re-conception itself falls into the trap of technological determinism and finally, how the universalist notion of vulnerability can seemingly negate human autonomy that is a key feature of human dignity.}

abstract = {Our reliance on the underground space to deliver critical civil engineering infrastructure is growing: to accommodate utility and transport infrastructure in urban environments, to provide innovative housing and commercial solutions, and to support proliferating renewable energy infrastructure, particularly offshore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is arguably the most promising enabler to transform geotechnical engineering by extracting knowledge from data to achieve step-change increases in efficiency, sustainability, reliability and safety. This paper seeks to develop a shared understanding of the state of the art of AI in geotechnics and to explore future developments. By way of example, specific popular use cases in geotechnics are considered to highlight current progress in AI applications including intelligent site investigation, predictive modelling for soil behaviour, and optimisation of design and construction processes. The paper then addresses key research challenges, such as data scarcity and interpretability, and discusses the opportunities that lie ahead in the integration of AI with geotechnical engineering. Finally, priority technological enablers are identified for future transformations.}

The objective of this review is to critically assess recent advances in energy management and artificial intelligence (AI) applications to enhance efficiency in papermaking processes. Following a systematic literature review based on PRISMA guidelines, the study examines the role of AI in optimizing mechanical refining, dewatering and drying, friction reduction, and condition monitoring. Results show that AI can fine-tune operational parameters in mechanical refining, leading to energy savings of up to 15 %. In dewatering and drying, AI-driven strategies improve heat recovery efficiency, potentially reducing energy consumption by 10–20 %. In friction management, AI-based optimization and the application of advanced technologies such as aerostatic bearings can reduce energy losses by up to 24 % in the long term. AI-driven condition monitoring strategies further reduce downtime and improve machine efficiency. The review concludes that AI offers considerable potential to improve energy efficiency and decarbonize the P&PI, but broader implementation is hindered by technological, financial, and organizational barriers.}

Conventional approaches, such as endoscopy and histology, often fail to adequately and accurately predict medium- and long-term outcomes, leading to suboptimal patient management. Artificial intelligence is emerging as a transformative force enabling standardized, accurate, and timely disease assessment and outcome prediction, including therapeutic response. Artificial intelligence–driven intestinal barrier healing assessment provides novel insights into deep healing, facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. In addition, the automated integration of multi-omics data can enhance patient profiling and personalized management strategies. The future of inflammatory bowel disease care lies in the artificial intelligence–enabled "endo-histo-omics" integrative real-time approach, harmoniously fusing endoscopic, histologic, and molecular data.

abstract = {Background
In medical education, particularly in anatomy and dermatology, generative artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to create customized illustrations. However, the underrepresentation of darker skin tones in medical textbooks and elsewhere, which serve as training data for AI, poses a significant challenge in ensuring diverse and inclusive educational materials.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the extent of skin tone diversity in AI-generated medical images and to test whether the representation of skin tones can be improved by modifying AI prompts to better reflect the demographic makeup of the US population.
Methods
In total, 2 standard AI models (Dall-E [OpenAI] and Midjourney [Midjourney Inc]) each generated 100 images of people with psoriasis. In addition, a custom model was developed that incorporated a prompt injection aimed at “forcing” the AI (Dall-E 3) to reflect the skin tone distribution of the US population according to the 2012 American National Election Survey. This custom model generated another set of 100 images. The skin tones in these images were assessed by 3 researchers using the New Immigrant Survey skin tone scale, with the median value representing each image. A chi-square goodness of fit analysis compared the skin tone distributions from each set of images to that of the US population.
Results
The standard AI models (Dalle-3 and Midjourney) demonstrated a significant difference between the expected skin tones of the US population and the observed tones in the generated images (P<.001). Both standard AI models overrepresented lighter skin. Conversely, the custom model with the modified prompt yielded a distribution of skin tones that closely matched the expected demographic representation, showing no significant difference (P=.04).
Conclusions
This study reveals a notable bias in AI-generated medical images, predominantly underrepresenting darker skin tones. This bias can be effectively addressed by modifying AI prompts to incorporate real-life demographic distributions. The findings emphasize the need for conscious efforts in AI development to ensure diverse and representative outputs, particularly in educational and medical contexts. Users of generative AI tools should be aware that these biases exist, and that similar tendencies may also exist in other types of generative AI (eg, large language models) and in other characteristics (eg, sex, gender, culture, and ethnicity). Injecting demographic data into AI prompts may effectively counteract these biases, ensuring a more accurate representation of the general population.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied in medicine, with growing interest in its potential to improve outcomes in cardiac arrest (CA). However, the scope and characteristics of current AI applications in resuscitation remain unclear.
Methods
This scoping review aims to map the existing literature on AI applications in CA and resuscitation and identify research gaps for further investigation. PRISMA-ScR framework and ILCOR guidelines were followed. A systematic literature search across PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane identified AI applications in resuscitation. Articles were screened and classified by AI methodology, study design, outcomes, and implementation settings. AI-assisted data extraction was manually validated for accuracy.
Results
Out of 4046 records, 197 studies met inclusion criteria. Most were retrospective (90%), with only 16 prospective studies and 2 randomised controlled trials. AI was predominantly applied in prediction of CA, rhythm classification, and post-resuscitation outcome prognostication. Machine learning was the most commonly used method (50% of studies), followed by deep learning and, less frequently, natural language processing. Reported performance was generally high, with AUROC values often exceeding 0.85; however, external validation was rare and real-world implementation limited.
Conclusions
While AI applications in resuscitation demonstrate encouraging performance in prediction and decision support tasks, clear evidence of improved patient outcomes or routine clinical use remains limited. Future research should focus on prospective validation, equity in data sources, explainability, and seamless integration of AI tools into clinical workflows.}

By constructing multi-dimensional building performance index system, combining data dimensionality reduction and nonlinear mapping technology, the problem of index homogeneity and parameter convergence in traditional evaluation is solved. Through experiments, it is found that the average evaluation accuracy of ACO-RBF and GRA-RBF models is 87.48% and 86.60% respectively, while the fusion model in this paper achieves a performance improvement with an accuracy of 93.31%. The model adopts a three-stage collaborative mechanism -- feature space reconstruction, parameter global optimization and nonlinear decision mapping. It significantly improves the objectivity and reliability of complex building performance evaluation, provides a verifiable technical framework for intelligence-driven design decisions, and promotes the transformation of architectural design scheme evaluation from an experience-dependent paradigm to a data-driven paradigm.}

This review addresses the need for effective governance by synthesising the fragmented landscape of AI governance approaches. Using bibliometric analysis and an in-depth literature review, it maps and classifies governance approaches to develop a hybrid, iterative and integrated AI governance model. The literature analysis reveals four primary categories that govern AI: formal, informal, risk management, and eclectic. The findings are used to embed these approaches directly into the different phases of the AI lifecycle, adapted from CRISP-DM and CDAC AI lifecycles. Furthermore, grounded in Ostrom’s polycentric governance theory, the study proposes ‘The Wheel of AI Governance’ (WAG) model to align governance actions with distinct phases of the AI lifecycle. It offers proper checkpoints to AI developers, project managers, policymakers and organisations to design, direct the development, assess the deployment, regulate the societal integration and advocate changes through constant monitoring of the AI applications. The paper concludes with policy recommendations that focus not just on technical soundness but also on ethical alignment, legal compliance, participatory co-creation, and the good of the community. The WAG model emphasises local agency, adaptive governance and sustainability while governing AI, particularly for less industrialised nations.}

This study investigates the influence of AI-based technologies on creating safe and respectful work atmospheres, focusing on their role in fostering safety, inclusion, and ethical management practices. Drawing on recent findings, the paper explores the dual nature of AI's effects, from enabling safer workplaces to posing ethical challenges. (1) The study identifies critical dynamics within AI-driven work environments. Through safety-oriented tools,—such as real-time risk monitoring systems,—AI contributes to incident prevention and fosters inclusion. However, its implementation also introduces challenges, particularly regarding privacy concerns and lack of transparency, which may trigger distrust and raise ethical dilemmas among employees. (2) The analysis further emphasizes ethical and operational barriers. To ensure effective integration, organisations must address the psychological impact of automation, ensuring it does not compromise employee morale or workplace cohesion. Transparent implementation practices are essential to avoid unintended negative consequences. (3) Findings reveal opportunities for AI to reshape organisational culture by harmonising operational efficiency with inclusive values. The study underscores the importance of aligning technological innovation with strategies that prioritise ethical governance and employee well-being. To support these insights, the study adopts a bibliographic analysis methodology, reviewing a curated corpus of peer-reviewed publications from the past five years. Sources were selected based on thematic relevance, scientific rigour, and empirical depth. This method enabled the identification of conceptual patterns, gaps in the literature, and key trends regarding the socio-ethical implications of AI in the workplace. These insights offer practical guidelines for organisations implementing AI technologies. By adopting transparent communication, ethical frameworks, and strategies aligned with employee well-being, businesses can leverage AI to create safer and more inclusive environments. This research underscores the importance of designing policies that balance technological advancement with respect for employee rights and privacy.}

While previous research has examined digital servitization and smart technologies, a gap remains in understanding how Artificial Intelligence (AI) specifically supports various types of digital servitization across both back-office and front-office activities. This study addresses this gap by investigating how AI enhances digital servitization through six case studies of companies implementing AI-driven servitized solutions. Adopting a capability theoretical perspective, we analyze the application of AI in both back-office and front-office activities for the delivery of base, intermediate, and advanced services. Our findings reveal that AI's role varies by service type, affecting customer interactions and operational tasks differently. We present a theoretical framework with five propositions that elucidate how AI capabilities enhance digital servitization. This framework gives scholars a refined understanding of AI's roles beyond the generalized black box approach and offers practitioners practical insights on leveraging AI for digital transformation.}

While research has begun mapping AI's role in digital media ecosystems, an often-overlooked factor is public attitudes toward regulating AI in election campaigns. Understanding these attitudes is essential as regulatory debates unfold at national and international levels, where public opinion often constrains the leeway of political decision-makers. We analyze data from two cross-sectional surveys conducted in the United States and Taiwan—two democracies with relatively lenient campaign regulations, which held presidential elections in the same year. We examine the role of general attitudes toward AI, psychological dispositions, and partisan alignments in shaping public support for AI regulation during elections. Our findings underscore the significance of psychological and attitudinal perspectives in predicting regulatory preferences.

We illustrate the application of our proposal to a time series of Bitcoin prices, which acts as the response variable, along with time series of classical financial prices, which act as explanatory variables. Three main findings emerge from the analysis. First, recurrent neural networks lead to a better performance, in terms of accuracy and robustness, with respect to classic neural networks. Second, the best performing models indicate that Bitcoin prices are affected mostly by their lagged values, and that their explainability, in terms of classical financial assets, is limited.

abstract = {Objectives
Congenital heart diseases (CHD) are a significant cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Detecting these abnormalities during pregnancy increases survival rates, enhances prognosis, and improves pregnancy management and quality of life for the affected families. Foetal echocardiography can be considered an accurate method for detecting CHDs. However, the detection of CHDs can be limited by factors such as the sonographer's skill, expertise and patient specific variables. Using artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to address these challenges, increasing antenatal CHD detection during prenatal care. A scoping review was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect databases, employing keywords, Boolean operators, and inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify peer-reviewed studies. Thematic mapping and synthesis of the found literature were conducted to review key concepts, research methods and findings.
Key findings
A total of n = 233 articles were identified, after exclusion criteria, the focus was narrowed to n = 7 that met the inclusion criteria. Themes in the literature identified the potential of AI to assist clinicians and trainees, alongside emerging new ethical limitations in ultrasound imaging.
Conclusion
AI-based tools in ultrasound imaging offer great potential in assisting sonographers and doctors with decision-making in CHD diagnosis. However, due to the paucity of data and small sample sizes, further research and technological advancements are needed to improve reliability and integrate AI into routine clinical practice.
Implications for practice
This scoping review identified the reported accuracy and limitations of AI-based tools within foetal cardiac ultrasound imaging. AI has the potential to aid in reducing missed diagnoses, enhance training, and improve pregnancy management. There is a need to understand and address the ethical and legal considerations involved with this new paradigm in imaging.}

First, the CA is tested in a safe environment with simulated clients (with Gen AI), instead of human clients; second, the TTT is conducted with a selected sample of actual users; and third, the TTT is conducted with a large sample of users.

The advent of digital twins in pharmacology presents transformative potential for precision medicine, enabling personalized treatment optimization through dynamic computational simulations of drug interactions at molecular, cellular, and patient levels. These advanced virtual replicas of a patient's biological system are designed to predict individual therapeutic responses with high fidelity, thereby moving beyond the one-size-fits-all paradigm. This paper explores the concept of digital pharmacological twins, detailing how they can integrate heterogeneous data, including multi-omic, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, clinical, and environmental information, and employing a synergy of advanced mechanistic and machine learning models. Using illustrative examples from ongoing international initiatives, this work highlights the methodological frameworks necessary for developing and validating such comprehensive predictive tools. We underscore the critical importance of model interoperability, robust data integration strategies, and rigorous validation to ensure clinical utility. Ultimately, digital pharmacological twins promise to enhance therapeutic efficacy, minimize adverse drug reactions, and accelerate the translation of pharmacological science into tangible patient benefits.}

Traditional breeding faces challenges such as polyploidy, high level of genomic heterogeneity, and complex gene-trait associations. By combining multi-omics data researchers learn more about the genetic and molecular basis of important agricultural traits. However, statistical methods are often insufficient to address the data complexity. By contrast, AI techniques, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), are emerging as powerful tools to explore complexity. Algorithms such as random forests (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) can support genomic selection (GS) and trait value prediction. Furthermore, DL models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM) dominate high-throughput phenotyping and time series analyses, providing accurate predictions for crop yield, disease resistance, and genotype adaptation. Large language models (LLMs) are able to integrate complex omics data. AI models can analyze large dataset, generated by genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomic applications because algorithms can combine different inputs, such as DNA sequences, gene expression profiles, protein–protein interaction networks, metabolite concentrations, and phenotypic data under specific environmental conditions. The integration of individual models can improve prediction accuracy by reducing resource inputs and automating labor-intensive tasks involved in breeding programs.

Statement of problem
Despite advances in artificial intelligence (AI), the quality, reliability, and understandability of health-related information provided by chatbots is still a question mark. Furthermore, studies on maxillofacial prosthesis (MP) information from AI chatbots are lacking.
Purpose
The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the reliability, quality, readability, and similarity of responses to MP-related questions generated by 4 different chatbots.
Material and methods
A total of 15 questions were provided by a maxillofacial prosthodontist and from 4 different chatbots (ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3). The Reliability Scoring (adapted DISCERN), the Global Quality Scale (GQS), the Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES), the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Grade Level (FKRGL), and the Similarity Index (iThenticate) were used to evaluate the performance of chatbots. Data were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the differences between chatbots were determined by the Conover multiple comparison test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction (α=.05).
Results
There were no significant differences between the chatbots' DISCERN scores, except for one question where ChatGPT showed significantly higher reliability than Gemini or Copilot (P=.03). There was no statistically significant difference among AI tools in terms of GQS values (P=.096), FRES values (P=.166), and FKRGL values (P=.247). The similarity rate of Gemini was statistically higher than other AI chatbots (P=.03).
Conclusions
ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3 showed good quality responses. All chatbots' responses were difficult for non-professionals to read and understand. Low similarity rates were found for all chatbots except Gemini, indicating originality of their information.}

Coronary artery disease (CAD) manifests differently between sexes, with data suggesting females develop more non-calcified plaques that traditional calcium-centric tools may not detect.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 100 individuals with low total atheroma volume (TAV) < 250 mm3 using artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) to assess sex-based differences in coronary plaque composition. Plaque subtypes included calcified, non-calcified, and low-density non-calcified atheroma volumes.
Results
Females had significantly lower total (p = 0.018) and non-calcified plaque (p < 0.001) burden compared to males. Calcified (p = 0.52) and low-density non-calcified (p = 0.16) plaque volumes did not differ significantly. Age was a consistent predictor of plaque volume across most subtypes.
Conclusions
Despite low overall plaque burden, males demonstrated a higher non-calcified plaque burden than females. This finding contrasts with previous literature and underscores the potential of AI-enabled CCTA to detect subclinical coronary disease, particularly in low-risk cohorts. These results support the use of comprehensive plaque profiling in both sexes to improve early risk stratification.}

It analyses the definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum technologies (QTs) that have been adopted by 27 EU member states and two associated countries (Norway and the United Kingdom), and which are contained in their national strategy documents. Drawing on the theoretical framework of sociotechnical imaginaries and employing qualitative thematic analysis, the article shows how these definitions co-constitute narratives that intertwine visions of technological development with governance choices. The lexicon used in definitions is not neutral, and reflects distinct epistemological assumptions and political priorities, thus demonstrating how definitional language acts as a performative tool that legitimizes strategic decisions and aligns collective expectations. AI and QTs are emerging technologies (ETs), characterized by rapid growth, high uncertainty, and potential for significant socio-economic impact, and they are the only two ETs for which most European countries have produced national strategic documents in response to specific requests and coordination efforts by the European Commission. A comparative thematic analysis reveals the relevance of these definitions for national and supranational governance, and indicates that the strategic documents are explicitly oriented toward imagining and shaping specific technological futures that justify increasing public investment in both domains.}

abstract = {In the field of medicine, uncertainty is inherent. Physicians are asked to make decisions on a daily basis without complete certainty, whether it is in understanding the patient’s problem, performing the physical examination, interpreting the findings of diagnostic tests, or proposing a management plan. The reasons for this uncertainty are widespread, including the lack of knowledge about the patient, individual physician limitations, and the limited predictive power of objective diagnostic tools. This uncertainty poses significant problems in providing competent patient care. Research efforts and teaching are attempts to reduce uncertainty that have now become inherent to medicine. Despite this, uncertainty is rampant. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, which are being rapidly developed and integrated into practice, may change the way we navigate uncertainty. In their strongest forms, AI tools may have the ability to improve data collection on diseases, patient beliefs, values, and preferences, thereby allowing more time for physician-patient communication. By using methods not previously considered, these tools hold the potential to reduce the uncertainty in medicine, such as those arising due to the lack of clinical information and provider skill and bias. Despite this possibility, there has been considerable resistance to the implementation of AI tools in medical practice. In this viewpoint article, we discuss the impact of AI on medical uncertainty and discuss practical approaches to teaching the use of AI tools in medical schools and residency training programs, including AI ethics, real-world skills, and technological aptitude.}

This review outlines recent progress in leveraging these computational methodologies to enhance device performance across domains such as dynamic light modulation, antenna design, and nonlinear optical phenomena. We systematically survey advancements in AI-driven forward and inverse design strategies, which bypass conventional trial-and-error approaches by embedding physical laws directly into optimization workflows. Furthermore, the integration of AI accelerates electromagnetic simulations and enables precise modelling of complex optical effects, including topological photonic states and nonlinear interactions. A comparative evaluation of algorithmic frameworks highlights their strengths in balancing computational efficiency, multi-objective optimization, and fabrication feasibility. Challenges such as limited interpretability of AI models and data scarcity for unconventional optical modes are critically addressed. Finally, we emphasize future opportunities in scalable multi-physics modelling, adaptive architectures, and practical deployment of AI-optimized photonic devices.

abstract = {Background
While artificial intelligence has significantly impacted medicine, the application of large language models (LLMs) in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) remains underexplored.
Purpose
This study aimed to measure and compare the accuracy of 4 leading LLMs on OMS board examination questions and to identify specific areas for improvement.
Study Design, Setting, and Sample
An in-silico cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate 4 artificial intelligence chatbots on 714 OMS board examination questions.
Predictor Variable
The predictor variable was the LLM used — LLM 1 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 4o [GPT-4o], OpenAI, San Francisco, CA), LLM 2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3.5 [GPT-3.5], OpenAI, San Francisco, CA), LLM 3 (Gemini, Google, Mountain View, CA), and LLM 4 (Copilot, Microsoft, Redmond, WA).
Main Outcome Variables
The primary outcome variable was accuracy, defined as the percentage of correct answers provided by each LLM. Secondary outcomes included the LLMs' ability to correct errors on subsequent attempts and their performance across 11 specific OMS subject domains: medicine and anesthesia, dentoalveolar and implant surgery, maxillofacial trauma, maxillofacial infections, maxillofacial pathology, salivary glands, oncology, maxillofacial reconstruction, temporomandibular joint anatomy and pathology, craniofacial and clefts, and orthognathic surgery.
Covariates
No additional covariates were considered.
Analyses
Statistical analysis included one-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) to compare performance across chatbots. χ2 tests were used to assess response consistency and error correction, with statistical significance set at P < .05.
Results
LLM 1 achieved the highest accuracy with an average score of 83.69%, statistically significantly outperforming LLM 3 (66.85%, P = .002), LLM 2 (64.83%, P = .001), and LLM 4 (62.18%, P < .001). Across the 11 OMS subject domains, LLM 1 consistently had the highest accuracy rates. LLM 1 also corrected 98.2% of errors, while LLM 2 corrected 93.44%, both statistically significantly higher than LLM 4 (29.26%) and LLM 3 (70.71%) (P < .001).
Conclusion and Relevance
LLM 1 (GPT-4o) significantly outperformed other models in both accuracy and error correction, indicating its strong potential as a tool for enhancing OMS education. However, the variability in performance across different domains highlights the need for ongoing refinement and continued evaluation to integrate these LLMs more effectively into the OMS field.}

abstract = {Background
Tobacco use remains a significant global health challenge, contributing substantially to preventable morbidity and mortality. Despite established interventions, outcomes vary due to scalability issues, resource constraints, and limited reach.
Objective
To systematically explore current artificial intelligence (AI) applications within tobacco control, highlighting their usefulness, benefits, limitations, and ethical implications.
Method
This scoping review followed the Arksey and O’Malley framework and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Five major databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and PsycINFO) were searched for articles published between January 2010 and March 2025. From 1,172 initial records, 57 studies met inclusion criteria after screening.
Results
AI-driven tools, including machine learning and natural language processing, effectively monitor social media for emerging tobacco trends and personalize smoking cessation interventions. Applications were predominantly focused on predictive modelling (using algorithms like XGBoost and SVM to predict e-cigarette use and relapse risk), cessation support (employing chatbots and reinforcement learning to improve accessibility), and social media surveillance (detecting synthetic nicotine promotions and analysing vaping trends). Approximately 22% of studies aligned with WHO FCTC Article 13 (tobacco advertising regulation), while 45% supported Article 14 (cessation services). However, tobacco industry interference remains a critical challenge, with AI technologies exploited to undermine public health initiatives, target vulnerable populations, and manipulate policy discussions. Critical issues including algorithmic bias, privacy concerns, interpretability challenges, and data quality must be addressed to ensure positive impact.
Conclusion
AI holds considerable promise for extending tobacco control if implemented ethically, transparently, and collaboratively. Future directions emphasize explainable AI development, integration of real-time intervention systems, global data inclusion, and robust cross-sector collaboration. While the current landscape shows a laudable start, it reflects the need for more diverse skill sets to fully harness AI’s extensive prospects for tobacco control and achieving tobacco endgame goals.}

abstract = {Background
Positive images of aging in traditional media promote better health outcomes in older adults, including increased life expectancy. Images produced by generative artifical intelligence (AI) technologies may reflect and amplify societal age-related biases, a phenomenon known as digital ageism. This study addresses a gap in research on the perpetuation of digital ageism in AI-generated images over time.
Objective
This study examined how visual characteristics of digital ageism in AI-generated representations of older adults changed over time. It aims to provide insight into the interplay between technology advancements, societal attitudes toward aging, and the well-being of older adults interacting with digital media.
Methods
This longitudinal study compared 164 images generated by Open AI’s DALL-E 2 at 2 time points, 1 year apart (2022 and 2023). Identical text prompts from the geriatric lexicon (eg, frail older adult, dementia) were used at both time points. Authors evaluated the images generated for demographic characteristics (perceived gender, race, and socioeconomic status), and primary emotion characteristics, then compared the frequency of these characteristics between years and evaluation characteristics using a type III 2-way ANOVA.
Results
Representations of White-racialized older adults were 5-fold higher than those of other races in both years. The mean number of representations of Asian-racialized individuals increased from 20 to 31 (P=.004), and the mean number of other racialized representations also increased, from 6 to 14 (P=.007). Representations of people with a middle-class socioeconomic status were significantly more frequent than other statuses in 2022 and 2023 with no changes in socioeconomic status from one year to the next. Prompts were largely neutral for expression terms, while image analyses for expressions did not show significant differences in positive, neutral, or negative emotions between 2022 and 2023. Prompts used for image generation had more male-oriented terms than expected, and male representation was higher then female representation in the images, with no difference in sex representation between the 2 time points.
Conclusions
Despite a social emphasis on positive views on aging, AI text-to-image generators persistently generated images with characteristics of digital ageism. Images predominantly featured White-racialized individuals at both time points, with no improvement in emotional representation despite using neutral text prompts. These findings highlight the persistence of ageist visual characteristics in AI-generated images over time. A limitation of this study is that it focused only on AI image generation and did not analyze other AI-generated content that may express digital ageism.}

ML approaches have shown promise in predicting the functional impact of genetic variants and establishing genotype–phenotype correlations, exemplified by tools like “Hema-Class” for factor VIII variants. However, some challenges remain, including the need to expand variant selection beyond missense mutations (which is now the standard of most studies).

abstract = {Products and services labeled as AI-created are perceived differently than identical ones attributed to humans, reflecting the phenomenon of algorithm aversion. This perception gap is partly explained by individuals’ tendency to attribute lower effort and creativity to work produced by AI algorithms. Through two pre-registered experiments, we investigate how individuals evaluate creative content when it is labeled as created by AI, humans, or human-AI collaboration. While previous research has established algorithm aversion across various domains, our findings reveal nuanced patterns in creative contexts. Individuals consistently rate content labeled as AI-authored as less creative and less favorable compared to content labeled as human-authored. This effect is driven by a sequential mediation: perceived effort influences perceived creativity, which in turn shapes overall attitudes. Importantly, content labeled as human-AI collaboration performs significantly better than AI-only content, suggesting a potential mitigation strategy. Our main theoretical contribution is the identification of the machine heuristic (MH), individuals' preexisting beliefs about AI capabilities, as a key moderator. Individuals with stronger MH beliefs attribute more effort to AI-generated work, which positively influences perceptions of creativity along with behavioral intentions. Using Netflix show descriptions as stimuli, we show these effects extend beyond attitudes to impact behavioral outcomes like willingness to watch. These results expand algorithm aversion theory by establishing MH as an important boundary condition and highlighting human-AI collaboration as an effective mitigation approach, offering valuable insights for creative industries integrating AI while maintaining positive perceptions among users.}

abstract = {Summary
Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping infectious disease diagnostics by supporting clinical decision making, optimising laboratory and clinical workflows, and enabling real-time disease surveillance. AI approaches improve pathogen detection, antimicrobial stewardship, and treatment monitoring, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. The role of AI in combating antimicrobial resistance is particularly significant, enabling rapid pathogen identification and personalised treatment. Despite progress over the past two decades, widespread AI adoption in infectious disease diagnostics faces challenges. In high-income countries, fragmented data ecosystems, incomplete datasets, and algorithmic bias hinder clinical integration. Meanwhile, low-income and middle-income countries contend with limited digital infrastructure, unstandardised data, and financial constraints, exacerbating disparities in diagnostic access. Further barriers include concerns over interoperability, data privacy, cybersecurity, and the regulation of AI implementation. This paper examines the role of AI in infectious disease diagnostics, highlighting both opportunities and limitations. It underscores the need for coordinated investments in digital infrastructure, harmonised data-sharing frameworks, and clinician engagement to support equitable, sustainable adoption. Addressing these challenges will enable health-care systems to harness the potential of AI to improve infectious disease detection, prevention, and management of infectious diseases, thereby strengthening global health resilience.}

Therefore, we applied the YOLOv7 model in this study; however, we encountered challenges including decreased accuracy with complex defect shapes and complications from data augmentation during pre-training. To solve these problems, we additionally applied the enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network for higher resolution and a Sobel noise-filtering algorithm to enhance the defect detection accuracy. And we evaluated our system by comparing it with a confidence score. This underscores the effectiveness of the approach in enhancing the defect detection capabilities. Therefore, this defect-monitoring system should be designed to preemptively identify internal structure deformations and enhance SFR safety and maintenance practices.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Background
Identifying the brand of reverse shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) implanted is key in the postoperative evaluation of patients, a process that can be time-consuming and prone to error. This is particularly relevant when revision shoulder arthroplasty is considered for shoulders where the implant brand is not available or accessible in the patient record. Identification of the prosthesis model by subjective assessment of preoperative radiographs is possible, but challenging. To assist surgeons in accurately and efficiently identifying prosthetic brands on radiographs, this study aimed to develop a computer vision AI algorithm capable of classifying eight commonly used rTSA prosthesis brands.
Methods
Using a previously developed deep learning (DL) shoulder classifier, 5,256 anteroposterior and axillary shoulder radiographs corresponding to 1,368 shoulders that had undergone rTSA surgery were identified. Four human observers reviewed and labeled the radiographs according to one of eight rTSA prosthesis manufacturers and model brands. All labeled radiographs were divided into developmental and testing sets, with stratified splitting to maintain consistent ratios of each prosthesis model across both sets. A DL classification algorithm based on EfficientNet was then trained on the developmental set using a five-fold cross-validation approach to classify these eight prosthesis models, with additional conformal prediction applied for uncertainty quantification. The trained DL algorithm and uncertainty quantification were evaluated on the testing set by calculating accuracy, F1 score, efficiency, and coverage.
Results
The trained AI algorithm achieved an average accuracy of 0.958 and an average F1 score of 0.946. After applying conformal prediction, average coverage was 0.978, with an average efficiency of 0.72. Integrated maps generated for the final model showed weighted pixels around the key features of the implant when making the prediction, including center screw, glenosphere, humeral tray, and the tip of the stem. The final model was able to classify images at a rate of approximately 45 images per second.
Conclusion
Our results demonstrate the ability of DL-based models to accurately and efficiently identify commonly used implants used in rTSA. This automated identification pipeline can particularly improve the clinical workflow for revision rTSA and has broader implications for the curation of radiographic registries.}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming speech-language pathology (SLP) and dysphagia management, offering innovative solutions for assessment, diagnosis, and rehabilitation. This narrative review examines AI applications in these fields from 2014 to 2024, with particular focus on implementation challenges in Latin America. We analyze key AI technologies—including deep learning, machine learning algorithms, and natural language processing—that have demonstrated high accuracy in detecting voice disorders, analyzing swallowing function, and supporting personalized rehabilitation. The review identifies three primary domains of AI application: diagnostic tools with improved sensitivity for speech-language disorders, rehabilitation technologies that enable customized therapy, and telehealth platforms that expand access to specialized care in underserved regions. However, significant barriers persist, particularly in Latin America, where limited infrastructure, insufficient linguistic adaptation, and scarce regional datasets hamper widespread implementation. Our pilot study evaluating commercially available large language models for rehabilitation planning demonstrates their potential utility in generating structured therapy activities, especially in resource-constrained settings. While AI shows promise in enhancing clinical workflows and expanding service delivery, the evidence suggests that current applications remain predominantly focused on diagnosis rather than integrated rehabilitation. This review highlights the need for culturally and linguistically adapted AI models, expanded regional research collaborations, and regulatory frameworks that ensure ethical AI integration into SLP and dysphagia care, positioning these technologies as complementary tools that enhance rather than replace clinical expertise.}
