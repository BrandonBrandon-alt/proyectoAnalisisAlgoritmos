abstract = {Purpose
While previous studies have examined the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots to interpret optical coherence tomography scans, their performance in interpreting fundus photographs of retinal disorders without text-based context remains unexplored. This study aims to evaluate the ability of three widely used AI chatbots to accurately diagnose common retinal disorders from fundus photographs in the absence of text-based context.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Methods
We prompted ChatGPT-4, Gemini, and Copilot, with a set of 50 fundus photographs from the American Society of Retina Specialists Retina Image Bank® in March 2024, comprising age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, epiretinal membrane, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal detachment. Chatbots were re-prompted four times using the same images throughout June 2024. The primary endpoint was the proportion of each chatbot’s correct diagnoses. No text-based guidance was provided.
Results
In March 2024, Gemini provided a correct diagnosis for 17 (34 %, 95 % CI: 21–49 %) fundus images, ChatGPT-4 for 16 (32 %, 95 % CI: 20–47 %), and Copilot for 9 (18 %, 95 % CI: 9–31 %) (p > 0.05). In June 2024, Gemini provided a correct diagnosis for 122 (61 %, 95 % CI: 53–67 %) images, ChatGPT-4 for 101 (51 %, 95 % CI: 43–58 %), and Copilot for 57 (29 %, 95 % CI: 22–35 %).
Conclusion
No AI chatbot use in this study was sufficiently accurate for the diagnosis of common retinal disorders from fundus photographs. AI chatbots should not currently be utilized in any clinical setting involving fundus images, given concerns for accuracy and bioethical considerations.}

abstract = {State estimation (SE) is the most critical part of power systems management and control centers because correct data from the equipment in the network is needed before any operation. Power systems in the past were less complex than today's systems, so simple methods were sufficient to solve the SE problem. As power systems have developed and distribution systems have become more interconnected to enhance reliability and handle growing loads and uncertainties, the methods for solving the SE problem have evolved over time. Many methods have been employed so far to address the state estimate problem; each of these techniques has the potential to be helpful in particular situations; therefore, identifying the strategies and getting familiar with their features can be crucial. Based on this issue, SE methods are divided into two categories. In one category, their dynamic and static characteristics are specified, and another category is based on the application of methods. Most of the methods have been studied, and the advantages and disadvantages of each have been thoroughly investigated to identify their strengths and weaknesses. The methods based on artificial intelligence (AI) can have good potential in solving SE problems, so they have been specifically investigated. This category of SE methods can be beneficial in solving future problems. Based on this, the existing challenges for the future of SE have been discussed. As a case study, we demonstrate how AI techniques, such as transfer learning (TL), can address one of these challenges—specifically in handling network reconfiguration in a 118-bus system. This example can guide those interested in the field to tackle similar challenges and provide direction for future research.}

abstract = {The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) has been instrumental in the optimization of friction stir welding (FSW) parameters. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), were utilized to predict mechanical properties such as ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and optimize pivotal welding parameters, such as rotational speed, feed rate, axial force, and tilt angle. These methodologies enabled precise real-time control, thus improving the quality and consistency of the resulting welded joints. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive review of the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in friction stir welding (FSW). The objective of the study was to synthesize existing research using AI to predict mechanical properties and optimize welding parameters. Furthermore, the study aimed to illustrate how artificial intelligence has improved the caliber and dependability of FSW joints through real-time observation and defect identification. A systematic literature review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines to identify relevant studies on the utilization of AI in FSW. A search algorithm was applied to databases such as ScienceDirect and Web of Science, resulting in the identification of 27 relevant scientific papers. The selection criteria were designed to identify studies that employed AI techniques for the prediction and optimization of FSW parameters. The principal findings indicated the pervasive deployment of 34 distinct AI techniques, with ANN being the most prevalent. Hybrid models combining AI with optimization algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms, were particularly effective. These models demonstrated high precision in predicting tensile strength and detecting internal defects, significantly improving joint quality. In conclusion, AI applications in FSW have proven essential for optimizing welding processes, with hybrid AI models showing superior performance. The continued integration of AI in FSW is expected to enhance the efficiency and reliability of welding operations, offering significant industrial advantages.}

abstract = {Recently, the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI technology, has surged across various industries. However, a notable drawback of this technology is its significant energy consumption during model training and operation, which poses challenges to sustainability goals and the environment. Consequently, various initiatives have emerged to promote what is termed "green artificial intelligence," aiming to mitigate these environmental impacts. Nevertheless, research discussing these initiatives remains scarce. Hence, this study aims to identify green artificial intelligence initiatives that contribute to environmental friendliness. This paper has comprehensively reviewed the existing literature, professional websites, and expert blogs to identify and analyze available green AI initiatives. This paper has identified 55 such initiatives, broadly categorized into six themes: cloud optimization, model efficiency, carbon footprinting, sustainability-focused AI development, open-source initiatives, and green AI research and community. This study discusses the strengths and limitations of each initiative to offer a comprehensive overview. The findings provide valuable insights, particularly for industries interested in green artificial intelligence and green technology in general. While some tools have been recognized and studied, comprehensive research and analysis are still required to empirically evaluate the majority of other tools due to their early stages of development in this field.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming hemostasis and thrombosis care, with applications spanning disease detection, risk assessment, laboratory testing, patient education, personalized medicine, and drug development. This narrative review explores AI’s clinical utility and limitations across these 6 domains.
Methods
A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus (up to February 2025) was conducted using terms related to AI, thrombosis, and hemostasis. Peer-reviewed, English-language studies were included, supplemented by manual and reference screening. Of 84 studies included, 38 focused on risk assessment, 16 on diagnostics, and others on personalized medicine, drug development, and patient engagement.
Results
AI demonstrated high accuracy in diagnosing thrombotic events via imaging and electronic health record analysis, although sensitivity gaps persisted for complex cases. In laboratory settings, AI outperformed manual review in detecting errors (eg, sample mislabeling and clotted specimens). Risk stratification models surpassed traditional scores (eg, CHA2DS2-VASc) in predicting thromboembolism, yet inconsistently performed in cancer-associated thrombosis. Personalized anticoagulation dosing and genetic severity prediction in hemophilia highlighted AI’s precision. Chatbots and adherence tools have enhanced patient education while AI-driven drug discovery identified novel anticoagulants and repurposed existing therapies. Limitations included variable external validation, “black box” interpretability issues, and dataset biases.
Conclusion
AI offers significant promise for improving diagnostics, risk prediction, and individualized therapy in thrombosis and haemostasis. Future integration depends on transparent, validated, and equitable AI systems embedded within clinical workflows.}

abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into daily life, individuals have increasingly turned to AI-driven systems for emotional support, companionship, and even romantic relationships. These relationships can be both beneficial and detrimental. Given the need for a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon, this systematic review uses Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love to provide a holistic summary of its key potentials and pitfalls. A total of 23 articles were identified from the following databases: EBSCOhost ERIC, EBSCOhost PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Results highlighted the key potentials of being in a romantic relationship with AI companions as: the facilitation of personal growth and well-being, provision of emotional connection and perceived social support, availability of customisation options, ability to form a sexual connection, as well as a possible outlet for users to seek entertainment and stress-relieving companionship. However, the phenomenon also raises concerns, as it may lead to users' over-reliance and susceptibility to manipulation from the chatbot, perceived shame from stigma surrounding romantic-AI companions, risk of personal data misuse, erosion of human relationships, perpetuation of biases, erosion of emotional connection from abrupt system updates and technical glitches, discomfort from uncanny valley effects, or concerns surrounding coercion to respond and early exposure to sexual content. This systematic review synthesises the dual-edged nature of romantic relationships with AI companions, and outlines critical avenues for future research.}

abstract = {High inflation is causing major manufacturing cost increases, making optimizing production lines a priority in Industry 5.0 manufacturing. As a result, there has been a rising interest in reducing these costs by more efficiently optimizing production, maintenance, and quality costs. This can be accomplished in manufacturing systems by integrating production task and maintenance activity scheduling, predictive maintenance, and quality control, with the application of artificial intelligence, information integration, and interoperability techniques. Accordingly, the present paper’s premise is to perform a literature review regarding production, maintenance, and quality integration in manufacturing environments. It aims to answer the main research question: “What are the current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques applied in production/maintenance scheduling, predictive maintenance, and quality control integration?”. To investigate this, a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-like methodology is followed to find the most efficient, reliable, and robust artificial intelligence techniques for production, maintenance, and quality optimization in production lines. Results show that Genetic Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Neural Networks, and Random Forests are among the most often used algorithms in the literature. Furthermore, integration between production/maintenance scheduling and predictive maintenance is done primarily through the rescheduling of production plans when a machine failure is detected. In addition, the same system employed for predictive maintenance is often integrated into also predicting product quality. However, while there have been some accomplishments in this field, research that considers full production, maintenance, and quality integration is still lacking, even if there is an increasing trend of research on this topic.}

abstract = {Background
Depression is a widespread mental health disorder that affects quality of life, with traditional treatments often resource-intensive. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of CBT-based AI in alleviating depressive symptoms through autonomous mental health management.
Purpose
To evaluate the effect and the integration level of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy-based artificial intelligence (AI) on autonomous health management in depressive symptoms care.
Methods
This systematic review used the PRISMA methodology and a mixed-methods appraisal tool. Studies included randomized controlled trials using artificial intelligence interventions for depression, analysing theoretical frameworks, intervention designs, and outcomes. Reviews and protocols were excluded. Data sources were searched in the Cochrane Library, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, and PubMed for articles published between October 2019 and October 2024.
Results
Five studies demonstrated that artificial intelligence designs incorporating the Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy guidance framework specifically indicated short-term intervention effectiveness. Of these AI interventions, only partial integration of 54 % implemented a theoretical framework in AI design. Nevertheless, findings revealed a significant 60 % decrease in depressive symptoms among participants who engaged with the AI-based autonomous mental health management, particularly those with moderate-to-severe depression, when grounded in a strong theoretical foundation.
Conclusion
Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy-based artificial intelligence interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in decrease depressive symptoms through patient self-management platforms. The theory-driven approach not only guides the development of AI applications but also facilitates the implementation of automated mental health interventions, thereby reducing the workload of nursing staff. This integration of CBT-guided AI technology empowers patients with self-management tools while optimizing nursing resources in mental health settings.}

First, through human coding, we determine whether student essays submitted as homework were created by humans or software, and second, we examine these essays' sentiment and authorship, as well as factors determining the use of artificial intelligence in learning. Data collection was conducted in April and May 2024 across thirty classes from twenty Hungarian high schools. Our results show that 16 % of high school students (N = 548) wrote their text-based homework assignments using artificial intelligence, though neither age nor parents' average educational level determined the use of AI in learning. Although women have more positive attitudes toward using AI for learning purposes, they are less likely to use it to complete their homework assignments. Finally, we found that fears related to artificial intelligence are general and lack specificity. Our findings have three practical implications: 1) they highlight the need for targeted educational programs to develop ethical AI use, 2) they assist teachers in identifying AI-generated texts, and 3) they draw attention to gender differences in AI usage.}

These findings are particularly important given that many of these interventions are brief and self-administered, making them both accessible and scalable for large populations. However, the efficacy of positive psychology interventions is often constrained by small effect sizes. In light of advancements in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), this study explored whether integrating AI chatbots into positive psychology interventions could enhance their efficacy compared to traditional self-administered approaches. Study 1 examined the efficacy of a gratitude intervention delivered through Snapchat's My AI, while Study 2 evaluated a self-affirmation intervention integrated with a customized ChatGPT. Both studies employed within-subject experimental designs. Contrary to our hypotheses, the integration of AI did not yield incremental improvements in gratitude outcomes (Study 1), or self-view outcomes (Study 2) compared to existing non-AI interventions. However, exploratory analyses revealed that the AI-integrated self-affirmation intervention significantly enhanced life satisfaction and medium-arousal positive affect, suggesting potential benefits for selected well-being outcomes. These findings indicate that while AI integration in brief, self-administered positive psychology interventions may enhance certain outcomes, its suitability varies across intervention types. Further research is needed to better understand the contexts in which AI can effectively augment positive psychology interventions.}

A systematic review methodology, following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, was employed to analyse studies from 2017 to 2025, identifying the AI algorithms most frequently used to personalise gaming experiences, improve patient engagement, and increase treatment efficacy. Our proposal categorises the algorithms based on their role in the game environment, which can either be game control or user assessment. Game control algorithms adapt the game environment and difficulty, while user assessment algorithms gather information about the player's state, such as performance, mood, or physiological data, to evaluate the treatment progress. The review also examines the growing trend of using multimodal data as input for machine learning models. Results show that a few well-known algorithms, such as Decision Trees (DT), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are frequently used. However, there is a clear distinction in their purposes: while FL is typically applied to game control tasks, SVMs are mainly used for user assessment.

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a significant improvement in the accuracy of the classification of pigmented skin lesions using artificial intelligence algorithms. Intelligent analysis and classification systems are significantly superior to visual diagnostic methods used by dermatologists and oncologists. However, the application of such systems in clinical practice is severely limited due to a lack of generalizability and risks of potential misclassification. Successful implementation of artificial intelligence-based tools into clinicopathological practice requires a comprehensive study of the effectiveness and performance of existing models, as well as further promising areas for potential research development. The purpose of this systematic review is to investigate and evaluate the accuracy of artificial intelligence technologies for detecting malignant forms of pigmented skin lesions. For the study, 10,589 scientific research and review articles were selected from electronic scientific publishers, of which 171 articles were included in the presented systematic review. All selected scientific articles are distributed according to the proposed neural network algorithms from machine learning to multimodal intelligent architectures and are described in the corresponding sections of the manuscript. This research aims to explore automated skin cancer recognition systems, from simple machine learning algorithms to multimodal ensemble systems based on advanced encoder-decoder models, visual transformers (ViT), and generative and spiking neural networks. In addition, as a result of the analysis, future directions of research, prospects, and potential for further development of automated neural network systems for classifying pigmented skin lesions are discussed.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) large language models are being used increasingly for health care–related queries. This systematic review assessed the reliability of AI chatbot responses to patient questions related to orthodontics.
Types of Studies Reviewed
PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, and Embase were systematically searched for studies published from January 1, 2022, through February 28, 2025. Only cross-sectional studies were included. Data were screened and extracted, and the risk of bias was assessed.
Results
Of 105 identified studies, 13 met the inclusion criteria. ChatGPT (OpenAI) showed 68.7% and 92.6% accuracy rates, scoring well on Likert scales and DISCERN evaluations. However, some studies reported lower scores (2.2/4.0, 3.8/10.0) and mixed results for Bard (Google) and Gemini (Google), highlighting inconsistencies in chatbot performance.
Practical Implications
Whereas large language models, particularly ChatGPT, cannot replace professional consultations, they offer generally reliable orthodontic information and can be valuable tools for addressing routine patient questions. Based on evolving commentary, AI is likely to serve as a frontline support system in the future, helping manage common inquiries, reduce clinician workload, and improve cost-effectiveness while ensuring that final care decisions remain with qualified professionals.

A total of 573 Hong Kong secondary and university students participated in a 14-h course. Data was collected through the AI Ethical Awareness Scale (AIEAS) questionnaire and students' self-reflective writings. The AIEAS framework, encompassing three dimensions, was based on the Belmont Report principles of human autonomy, beneficence, and fairness. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported this three-factor structure, with nine items retained. Multigroup CFA results demonstrated strong measurement invariance across gender, education level, and programming knowledge. All Cronbach's alpha and omega coefficient values exceeded 0.70, indicating satisfactory internal consistency and fair temporal stability. Furthermore, students' ethical awareness showed a significant improvement following the course intervention. This study not only provides a robust measure for researchers and practitioners to assess students' ethical awareness through behavioural engagement but also demonstrates the necessity of implementing an education course for cultivating ethical awareness through integrating experience and reflection.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
The automated segmentation of maxillary and mandibular bones in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using artificial intelligence (AI) is redefining the standards of digital dentistry and orthodontics, with applications in mini-implant placement, dental implantology, orthognathic surgery, and bone graft planning.
Objective
To systematically assess the performance of AI models – particularly U-Net-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) – for automated segmentation of maxillary bone structures in CBCT, following the PICOS model (Population – CBCT scans of human maxillae; Intervention – AI-based segmentation; Comparator – manual segmentation; Outcome – accuracy; Study design – diagnostic accuracy studies).
Material and methods
This systematic review adhered to PRISMA 2020 guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024592182). Eligibility criteria included studies applying AI to maxillary bone segmentation in CBCT and reporting quantitative accuracy metrics. Risk of bias was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. The GRADE tool for formulating and grading recommendations in clinical practice was also employed. Data collected comprised number of CBCT scans, AI model architecture, evaluation metrics, and reported clinical applications.
Results
Thirty-one studies, analysing 11,432 CBCT scans, met the inclusion criteria. AI models consistently achieved high segmentation accuracy, with Dice similarity coefficients frequently exceeding 0.98, while substantially reducing processing time compared to manual segmentation. Applications ranged from implant planning and orthognathic surgery to digital orthodontics. Persistent challenges included anatomical variability, imaging artifacts, and the limited availability of high-quality annotated datasets.
Conclusions
AI-based segmentation of maxillary and mandibular bones in CBCT demonstrates promising accuracy and efficiency compared with manual techniques. Nevertheless, the certainty of evidence is limited by retrospective designs and small, heterogeneous samples. Large-scale, prospective multicentre studies with standardized evaluation are needed before these methods can be reliably adopted in routine clinical practice.}

Specifically, we investigate the performance of a domain-adapted similarity measure compared to OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 models. Using a dataset of over 82,000 research publications from an Australian university, we apply the similarity measure to assign SDG tags and benchmark the results against outputs from the two GPT models. Our findings show that the similarity-based method achieves comparable performance, with successful classification rates of 82.89% (GPT-3.5) and 89.34% (GPT-4), respectively. The proposed approach provides a reliable, transparent, and cost-effective solution for large-scale SDG classification, particularly valuable for institutions handling sensitive data or lacking access to commercial AI tools.

We then propose the definition and attributes of AGIME and establish a standard system framework for the AGIME life cycle. This framework includes published specifications such as information model, data specification, evaluation specification, and application requirements on teaching and learning. We introduce standard application cases to validate the effectiveness of AGIME standard system framework. Finally, we present several specifications currently under development within this standard system, including interface, regulatory, operation and maintenance, and security, ethics, and privacy specifications.

To systematically review the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in health literacy, highlighting limitations and future developments.
Methods
A systematic review, following PRISMA guidelines, was conducted searching 6 databases for studies published from January 1, 2014, through April 10, 2024. Data extracted included population characteristics, health literacy definitions and measurement, study objectives, AI techniques, and metrics. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted checklist.
Results
From 1296 studies, 18 (1.4%) met inclusion criteria. These studies primarily evaluated text-based materials, including online articles, and electronic health records, with most materials in English, but also incorporated other languages. Artificial intelligence played various roles, including evaluating complexity, text simplification/readability enhancement, translation, and question-answering. Only 5 studies involved participant engagement. Seven studies provided a health literacy definition, consistently describing it as an individual’s ability to obtain, understand, and use health information for informed decisions, often linking it to external factors. However, only 1 study incorporated an individual level health literacy measurement tool, whereas organizational level health literacy measurement remained largely overlooked. The AI techniques used included traditional machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models. Evaluation metrics were categorized into human evaluation, readability, and machine learning metrics.
Conclusion
The review highlights AI’s dynamic application in relation to health literacy; however, measurement of health literacy, at both an individual and organizational level, to evidence AI's effectiveness remains limited. In addition, future work should not only measure health literacy outcomes more rigorously but also pursue research on enhancing AI model performance, robust evaluation, and their practical implementation in real-world settings.}

Using a three-round Delphi method with eighteen experts (scholars and practitioners), a structured framework for integrating AI into SA was developed and validated. The findings show that AI can enhance Scenario Analysis by increasing efficiency, expanding scenario generation, and improving data-driven insights while preserving the essential role of human judgment in contextual interpretation and final decision-making. Rather than replacing managerial expertise, AI serves as a powerful decision-support tool. The resulting AI-SA framework gives managers a structured approach for leveraging AI within SA, promoting more adaptive, forward-looking strategic planning in uncertain economic environments.

This shift is poised to inject renewed dynamism into the global economy. This paper develops a theoretical framework that elucidates the relationship between AI adoption and innovation within digital enterprises, drawing upon resource-based theory (RBT) and absorptive capacity theory (ACAP). Utilizing a sample of Chinese digital enterprises listed overseas from 2000 to 2023, this study employs Python to extract keywords associated with “artificial intelligence” from corporate annual reports, thereby constructing a proxy measure for AI adoption. We empirically investigate the impact of AI adoption on innovation within digital enterprises. Our findings demonstrate that AI adoption significantly enhances innovation in digital enterprises, a result that remains robust across a series of robustness tests. Additional analysis reveals that the absorptive capacity of enterprises mediates the relationship between AI adoption and innovation, while slack resources act as a moderating factor, attenuating the link between absorptive capacity and innovation. This paper extends our understanding of the implications of AI on broader innovation entities, elucidating the mechanisms and boundary conditions of AI application in digital enterprises. It also offers insights into how enterprises can effectively integrate AI technology, strategically configure and utilize slack resources, and ultimately enhance their innovation performance.}

abstract = {Background
Bioavailability, defined as the extent to which active components in food are absorbed and utilized by the body, is a critical factor in determining the health benefits of food. The intricate interactions of various critical aspects, particularly those concerning extensive, complicated datasets of host conditions and ingredient matrix effects, are obstacles to bioavailability research. These difficulties influence research on intestinal absorption efficiency, solubility, and chemical stability.
Scope and approach
One effective tool for overcoming these challenges is artificial intelligence (AI). AI models can be used to analyse and forecast the bioavailability of food ingredients under various processing conditions and food matrix compositions by analyzing sizable datasets, as well as reveal the effects of these parameters. The aims of this review are to provide a theoretical foundation for AI-based bioavailability research, describe applicable methods, outline prospective research directions for AI-based innovation in food science and nutrition, and address existing difficulties.
Key findings and conclusions
The use of AI in bioavailability research on proteins, peptides, carbohydrates, and micronutrients has transformative potential. AI-based models can be used to simultaneously deduce structures, optimize excipient ingredients, devise distribution systems, offer research guidance and minimize experimental trials. However, the application of these models is hampered by the following factors: (1) the absence of high-quality standardized datasets that accurately represent biological complexity, which may result in model overfitting and bias; (2) the restricted mechanistic interpretability of "black box" algorithms, which impedes regulatory approval and scientific validation; and (3) interdisciplinary validation challenges between computational predictions and in vitro and in vivo experimental outcomes.}

The Blueprint lists “notice and explanation” as one of five principles fundamental to delivering consumer protections as artificial intelligence (AI) is developed and used. This qualitative assessment of 40 company websites evaluates the extent to which privacy/AI notices align with this call for AI transparency. The assessment assigns full, half, or zero stars on ten transparency criteria, including (among others): whether notices are accessible via company websites and in plain language, reference applicable laws, explain how AI systems work, their risks, data retention policies, and data storage/processing policies. Findings suggest companies convey privacy transparency elements but disclose few details about the use/implications of AI. The average score across the sample is 2.95/10 stars. Each company provides homepage access to notices and information about applicable law. Many provide details about data storage/processing though only eighteen describe data retention. While some provide minimal definitions of automated systems, few explain how AI systems work or the risks of use. 34/40 require a grade twelve or higher reading-level, and most provide AI details away from the privacy policy. To support the auditability of AI systems via consent-based protections companies should improve upon these transparency efforts. Companies should better-align with calls for AI transparency like those from the Biden White House, currently accessible via the U.S. National Archives. Accessible and plain language notices are recommended, as are details about how AI systems work, and the implications of AI development and use.}

However, traditional data trading models face significant challenges, including privacy concerns, pricing mechanisms, transaction efficiency, and decentralization. Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a transformative approach to data trading by enabling local intelligence, privacy-preserving computation, and decentralized architectures. This paper explores the integration of Edge AI with data trading, analyzing its technical foundations, key challenges, and diverse applications. Edge AI enhances data trading by reducing data transmission costs, enabling privacy-preserving federated learning, and facilitating decentralized trust mechanisms through blockchain. Compared to centralized models, Edge AI-based data trading supports secure, efficient, and transparent transactions while mitigating the data misuse. This paradigm benefits various domains, including IoT-enabled smart factories and connected vehicles, financial risk assessment and credit scoring, secure electronic health record sharing, supply chain optimization, and personalized advertising. Despite its advantages, Edge AI-driven data trading still faces challenges in standardization, security, computational efficiency, data quality assessment, and regulatory compliance. Future research should focus on establishing global data trading protocols, optimizing privacy-preserving mechanisms, and improving decentralized transaction models to enhance security and efficiency. Edge AI-enabled data trading will play an increasingly vital role in facilitating trustworthy and efficient data markets across digital industries.}

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) have dominated public interest due to their apparent capability to accurately replicate learned knowledge in narrative text. However, there is a lack of clarity about the accuracy and capability standards of LLMs in health care examinations.
Objective
We conducted a systematic review of LLM accuracy, as tested under health care examination conditions, as compared to known human performance standards.
Methods
We quantified the accuracy of LLMs in responding to health care examination questions and evaluated the consistency and quality of study reporting. The search included all papers up until September 10, 2023, with all LLMs published in English journals that report clear LLM accuracy standards. The exclusion criteria were as follows: the assessment was not a health care exam, there was no LLM, there was no evaluation of comparable success accuracy, and the literature was not original research.The literature search included the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms used in all possible combinations: “artificial intelligence,” “ChatGPT,” “GPT,” “LLM,” “large language model,” “machine learning,” “neural network,” “Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” “Generative Transformer,” “Generative Language Model,” “Generative Model,” “medical exam,” “healthcare exam,” and “clinical exam.” Sensitivity, accuracy, and precision data were extracted, including relevant CIs.
Results
The search identified 1673 relevant citations. After removing duplicate results, 1268 (75.8%) papers were screened for titles and abstracts, and 32 (2.5%) studies were included for full-text review. Our meta-analysis suggested that LLMs are able to perform with an overall medical examination accuracy of 0.61 (CI 0.58-0.64) and a United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) accuracy of 0.51 (CI 0.46-0.56), while Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) can perform with an overall medical examination accuracy of 0.64 (CI 0.6-0.67).
Conclusions
LLMs offer promise to remediate health care demand and staffing challenges by providing accurate and efficient context-specific information to critical decision makers. For policy and deployment decisions about LLMs to advance health care, we proposed a new framework called RUBRICC (Regulatory, Usability, Bias, Reliability [Evidence and Safety], Interoperability, Cost, and Codesign–Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement [PPIE]). This presents a valuable opportunity to direct the clinical commissioning of new LLM capabilities into health services, while respecting patient safety considerations.

abstract = {The physical interactions between proteins are largely determined by the structural properties at their binding interfaces. It was found that the binding interfaces in distinctive protein complexes are highly similar. The structural properties underlying different binding interfaces could be further captured by artificial intelligence. In order to test this hypothesis, we broke protein-protein binding interfaces into pairs of interacting fragments. We employed a generative model to encode these interface fragment pairs in a low-dimensional latent space. After training, new conformations of interface fragment pairs were generated. We found that, by only using a small number of interface fragment pairs that were generated by artificial intelligence, we were able to guide the assembly of protein complexes into their native conformations. These results demonstrate that the conformational space of fragment pairs at protein-protein binding interfaces is highly degenerate. Features in this degenerate space can be well characterized by artificial intelligence. In summary, our machine learning method will be potentially useful to search for and predict the conformations of unknown protein-protein interactions.}

Adopting data and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is essential to ensure efficient operations and informed decision making and to keep a competitive market advantage. This paper proposes an integrated, multimodal AI framework to support data-intensive dairy farm operations by leveraging big data principles and advancing them through AI technologies. The proposed architecture incorporates edge computing, autonomous AI agents, and federated learning to enable real-time, privacy-preserving analytics at the farm level and promote knowledge sharing and refinement through research farms and cloud collaboration. Farms collect heterogeneous data, which can be transformed into embeddings for both local inference and cloud analysis. These embeddings form the input of AI agents that support health monitoring, risk prediction, operational optimization, and decision making. Privacy is preserved by sharing only model weights or anonymized data externally. The edge layer handles time-sensitive tasks and communicates with a centralized enterprise cloud hosting global models and distributing updates. A research and development cloud linked to research farms ensures model testing and validation. The entire system is orchestrated by autonomous AI agents that manage data, choose models, and interact with stakeholders, and human oversight ensures safe decisions, as illustrated in the practical use case of mastitis management. This architecture could support data integrity, scalability, and real-time personalization, along with opening up space for partnerships between farms, research institutions, and regulatory bodies to promote secure, cross-sector innovation.}

The study aims to identify which AI methods are most commonly employed and how they align with these quality attributes. A conceptual map was developed to visualize the relationships between dimensions and AI techniques such as deep learning, federated learning, data-centric AI, and ontology-based data governance.

Review Methods
A systematic search was conducted to identify studies exploring the integration of generative AI in simulation-based learning. Inclusion criteria focused on undergraduate health professions education and clinical reasoning outcomes.
Results
Six studies with a total of 492 participants met the inclusion criteria. Generative AI was used to create simulation scenarios, virtual patients, provide feedback, analyze student performance, and support inquiry-based learning. Four studies reported significantly improved clinical reasoning outcomes with AI-assisted teaching. One study reported the comparability between AI-generated feedback and expert feedback, though expert input remained superior in complex cases.
Conclusions

We take Chinese A-share enterprises from 2008 to 2023 as the research samples, and empirically test the impact and mechanisms of artificial intelligence on corporate tax avoidance. Based on the perspective of corporate governance costs, we discuss the influence and function mechanism of artificial intelligence on corporate tax avoidance. The results show that artificial intelligence can promote tax avoidance for enterprises by increasing high-skilled labor cost and intelligent input cost. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that artificial intelligence exerts a more influence on corporate tax avoidance in circumstances where tax regulatory intensity is diminished, and the tax burden is escalated. This study enriches the research on the development of enterprise intelligence in the new era, opens the "black box" between artificial intelligence and tax avoidance, and provides evidence for the logic between them.}

Explainable AI (XAI) also strives to promote transparency and human comprehension of black-box AI models. The explainability problem has been approached using a variety of XAI strategies; however, given the complexity of the search space, it may be tricky for ML developers and data scientists to construct XAI applications and choose the optimal XAI algorithms.

abstract = {This study aims to clarify the synergistic effect of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the evolution of visual communication of new media art, thereby exploring an AI layout design method based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in the practice of visual communication design. Firstly, this study designs an AI layout design model based on CNN, and trains and optimizes it with training data. Secondly, the automatic generation of layout design is realized by constantly adjusting the model parameters and network structure. Finally, various AI layout design algorithms are compared, and their effects and performances in layout design generation are analyzed. To verify the layout and composition matching model's performance, traditional layout design methods are selected for comparison (layout, comparison, harmonic composition, etc.). This study involved 20 design students as participants, evaluating them across three dimensions: overall comprehensive assessment, readability of text information, and rationality of visual path using a Likert 7-point scale. The results reveal that the proposed method's evaluation outcomes in these three aspects are 5.95, 5.68, and 5.74, respectively, higher than the traditional layout design methods. To sum up, the generative AI discussed here can automatically generate design elements and schemes through deep learning and big data analysis, thus providing a reference for the innovation of visual communication design.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promises for improving TED diagnosis and treatment; however, no systematic review has yet characterized the research landscape, key challenges, and future directions. We followed PRISMA guidelines to search multiple databases until January, 2025, for studies applying AI to computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear, facial or retinal imaging in TED patients. Using the APPRAISE-AI tool, we assessed study quality and included 41 studies covering various AI applications. Sample sizes ranged from 33 to 2288 participants, predominantly East Asian. CT and facial imaging were the most common modalities, reported in 16 and 13 articles, respectively. Studies addressed clinical tasks—diagnosis, activity assessment, severity classification, and treatment prediction—and technical tasks—classification, segmentation, and image generation—with classification being the most frequent. Researchers primarily employed deep-learning models, such as residual network (ResNet) and Visual Geometry Group (VGG). Overall, the majority of the studies were of moderate quality. Image-based AI shows strong potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and guide personalized treatment strategies in TED. Future research should prioritize robust study designs, the creation of public datasets, multimodal imaging integration, and interdisciplinary collaboration to accelerate clinical translation.}

abstract = {Background
Use of artificial intelligence to generate personal statements for residency is currently not permitted but is difficult to monitor. This study sought to evaluate the ability of surgical residency application reviewers to identify artificial intelligence–generated personal statements and to understand perceptions of this practice.
Methods
Three personal statements were generated using ChatGPT, and 3 were written by medical students who previously matched into surgery residency. Blinded participants at a single institution were instructed to read all personal statements and identify which were generated by artificial intelligence; they then completed a survey exploring their opinions regarding artificial intelligence use.
Results
Of the 30 participants, 50% were faculty (n = 15) and 50% were residents (n = 15). Overall, experience ranged from 0 to 20 years (median, 2 years; interquartile range, 1–6.25 years). Artificial intelligence–derived personal statements were identified correctly only 59% of the time, with 3 (10%) participants identifying all the artificial intelligence–derived personal statements correctly. Artificial intelligence–generated personal statements were labeled as the best 60% of the time and the worst 43.3% of the time. When asked whether artificial intelligence use should be allowed in personal statements writing, 66.7% (n = 20) said no and 30% (n = 9) said yes. When asked if the use of artificial intelligence would impact their opinion of an applicant, 80% (n = 24) said yes, and 20% (n = 6) said no. When survey questions and ability to identify artificial intelligence–generated personal statements were evaluated by faculty/resident status and experience, no differences were noted (P > .05).
Conclusion
This study shows that surgical faculty and residents cannot reliably identify artificial intelligence–generated personal statements and that concerns exist regarding the impact of artificial intelligence on the application process.}

This study examines how AI adoption influences marketing performance through dynamic capabilities and organizational flexibility in the context of student entrepreneurship education. Drawing on a longitudinal survey of 434 student entrepreneurs across universities in Eastern China, we employ a dual-stage analytical framework combining PLS-SEM and fsQCA to investigate the multifaceted relationships between AI drivers, dynamic capabilities, and marketing outcomes. Our findings reveal that technology-driven, organization-driven, environment-driven, and human-driven factors of AI positively influence students' dynamic capabilities—sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring—which subsequently enhance their AI-enabled marketing performance. Organizational flexibility emerges as a significant positive moderator in this relationship. The fsQCA analysis identifies six configurations leading to optimal marketing performance, providing nuanced insights for curriculum design. These findings contribute to management education literature by demonstrating how AI integration can enhance entrepreneurial learning outcomes and inform pedagogical approaches. The study offers practical implications for educators seeking to prepare students for AI-driven business environments while advancing responsible management education aligned with sustainable development goals.}

abstract = {Purpose
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) enables banks to enhance customer service experiences. However, limited research has been conducted on factors influencing customers’ intention to switch from traditional to artificial intelligence (AI) based banking services. Therefore, the present study explored the key antecedents of the aforementioned intention.
Methods
This two-stage study was based on the push–pull–mooring model. In Stage 1, in-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with stakeholders related to AI-based banking services to identify critical factors influencing customers’ intention to switch from traditional to AI-based customer services. In Stage 2, the results obtained in Stage 1 were combined with results from the literature to create a second-order model and direct-effect model (Models 1 and 2, respectively). Quantitative survey data were then collected to validate these models.
Results
Model 1 indicated that among pull, push, and mooring factors, pull factors had the strongest effect on the aforementioned intention, followed by mooring factors and then push factors. The explanatory power (R2) of this model was 70 %. Furthermore, Model 2 indicated that the attractiveness of the alternative (a pull factor) and the need for interpersonal interaction and inertia (mooring factors) were the key factors influencing switching intention. The explanatory power (R2) of this model was 76 %.
Conclusion
In summary, this study identified and validated critical factors affecting customers’ intention to switch to AI-based banking services. The findings enrich the understanding the social interaction and user behavior of AI, offering valuable insights for promoting AI-driven services and applications.}
