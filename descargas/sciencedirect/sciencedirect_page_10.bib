abstract = {The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) has been instrumental in the optimization of friction stir welding (FSW) parameters. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), were utilized to predict mechanical properties such as ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and optimize pivotal welding parameters, such as rotational speed, feed rate, axial force, and tilt angle. These methodologies enabled precise real-time control, thus improving the quality and consistency of the resulting welded joints. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive review of the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in friction stir welding (FSW). The objective of the study was to synthesize existing research using AI to predict mechanical properties and optimize welding parameters. Furthermore, the study aimed to illustrate how artificial intelligence has improved the caliber and dependability of FSW joints through real-time observation and defect identification. A systematic literature review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines to identify relevant studies on the utilization of AI in FSW. A search algorithm was applied to databases such as ScienceDirect and Web of Science, resulting in the identification of 27 relevant scientific papers. The selection criteria were designed to identify studies that employed AI techniques for the prediction and optimization of FSW parameters. The principal findings indicated the pervasive deployment of 34 distinct AI techniques, with ANN being the most prevalent. Hybrid models combining AI with optimization algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms, were particularly effective. These models demonstrated high precision in predicting tensile strength and detecting internal defects, significantly improving joint quality. In conclusion, AI applications in FSW have proven essential for optimizing welding processes, with hybrid AI models showing superior performance. The continued integration of AI in FSW is expected to enhance the efficiency and reliability of welding operations, offering significant industrial advantages.}

Overcrowding and long wait times in emergency departments (EDs) remain global challenges that negatively affect patient outcomes and staff satisfaction. As an emerging technology, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential to optimize ED operations and reduce wait times.
Objective
Establish a strategy to evaluate AI modeling as it relates to utilizing AI based strategies for ED flow.
Methods
We searched Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Scopus for English-language studies published from January 1, 1946, to August 17, 2023, and we will update our search to ensure currency. The ROBINS-I tool assessed study quality, while PROBAST examined the risk of bias and applicability.
Results
Out of 17,569 screened studies, 65 full-text articles were evaluated for eligibility, with 16 quantitative observational studies meeting inclusion criteria. The best-performing algorithms included regression-based methods (n = 2), traditional single-model machine learning (n = 8), neural networks/deep learning (n = 3), natural language processing (n = 1), and ensemble methods (n = 2). None of the studies examined AI’s impact in a real ED setting, though four simulations reported wait-time reductions ranging from 7 to 43.2 minutes.
Conclusions
AI integration in ED is still in its infancy. Our review found no real-world ED implementation studies, and most of the existing research lacked involvement from ED experts. This gap highlights the lack of insight into AI’s practical impact. Future reviews and research must clarify these dimensions, guiding AI's effective, collaborative adoption in ED workflows.}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming hemostasis and thrombosis care, with applications spanning disease detection, risk assessment, laboratory testing, patient education, personalized medicine, and drug development. This narrative review explores AI’s clinical utility and limitations across these 6 domains.
Methods
A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus (up to February 2025) was conducted using terms related to AI, thrombosis, and hemostasis. Peer-reviewed, English-language studies were included, supplemented by manual and reference screening. Of 84 studies included, 38 focused on risk assessment, 16 on diagnostics, and others on personalized medicine, drug development, and patient engagement.
Results
AI demonstrated high accuracy in diagnosing thrombotic events via imaging and electronic health record analysis, although sensitivity gaps persisted for complex cases. In laboratory settings, AI outperformed manual review in detecting errors (eg, sample mislabeling and clotted specimens). Risk stratification models surpassed traditional scores (eg, CHA2DS2-VASc) in predicting thromboembolism, yet inconsistently performed in cancer-associated thrombosis. Personalized anticoagulation dosing and genetic severity prediction in hemophilia highlighted AI’s precision. Chatbots and adherence tools have enhanced patient education while AI-driven drug discovery identified novel anticoagulants and repurposed existing therapies. Limitations included variable external validation, “black box” interpretability issues, and dataset biases.
Conclusion
AI offers significant promise for improving diagnostics, risk prediction, and individualized therapy in thrombosis and haemostasis. Future integration depends on transparent, validated, and equitable AI systems embedded within clinical workflows.}

abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into daily life, individuals have increasingly turned to AI-driven systems for emotional support, companionship, and even romantic relationships. These relationships can be both beneficial and detrimental. Given the need for a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon, this systematic review uses Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love to provide a holistic summary of its key potentials and pitfalls. A total of 23 articles were identified from the following databases: EBSCOhost ERIC, EBSCOhost PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Results highlighted the key potentials of being in a romantic relationship with AI companions as: the facilitation of personal growth and well-being, provision of emotional connection and perceived social support, availability of customisation options, ability to form a sexual connection, as well as a possible outlet for users to seek entertainment and stress-relieving companionship. However, the phenomenon also raises concerns, as it may lead to users' over-reliance and susceptibility to manipulation from the chatbot, perceived shame from stigma surrounding romantic-AI companions, risk of personal data misuse, erosion of human relationships, perpetuation of biases, erosion of emotional connection from abrupt system updates and technical glitches, discomfort from uncanny valley effects, or concerns surrounding coercion to respond and early exposure to sexual content. This systematic review synthesises the dual-edged nature of romantic relationships with AI companions, and outlines critical avenues for future research.}

abstract = {High inflation is causing major manufacturing cost increases, making optimizing production lines a priority in Industry 5.0 manufacturing. As a result, there has been a rising interest in reducing these costs by more efficiently optimizing production, maintenance, and quality costs. This can be accomplished in manufacturing systems by integrating production task and maintenance activity scheduling, predictive maintenance, and quality control, with the application of artificial intelligence, information integration, and interoperability techniques. Accordingly, the present paper’s premise is to perform a literature review regarding production, maintenance, and quality integration in manufacturing environments. It aims to answer the main research question: “What are the current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques applied in production/maintenance scheduling, predictive maintenance, and quality control integration?”. To investigate this, a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-like methodology is followed to find the most efficient, reliable, and robust artificial intelligence techniques for production, maintenance, and quality optimization in production lines. Results show that Genetic Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Neural Networks, and Random Forests are among the most often used algorithms in the literature. Furthermore, integration between production/maintenance scheduling and predictive maintenance is done primarily through the rescheduling of production plans when a machine failure is detected. In addition, the same system employed for predictive maintenance is often integrated into also predicting product quality. However, while there have been some accomplishments in this field, research that considers full production, maintenance, and quality integration is still lacking, even if there is an increasing trend of research on this topic.}

AI methods reviewed include Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Computer Vision (CV). Overall, a significantly growing interest in applying AI methods can be observed across all research areas. However, noticeable differences exist between the three topics. While CV and DL techniques are applied to image data in research on the architectural design of facades, research on environmental aspects of facades often uses numerical data with relatively small datasets and classical ML models. Research on facade structure also tends to use image data but also incorporates numerical performance prediction. A major limitation remains a lack of generalizability, which could be addressed by more comprehensive datasets and novel DL techniques. These include concepts such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks, where domain knowledge is integrated into hybrid data-driven models, and multi-modal diffusion models, which offer generative modeling capabilities to support inverse and forward design tasks. The trends and directions outlined in this review suggest that AI will continue to advance facade research and, in line with other domains, has the potential to achieve a level of maturity suitable for adoption beyond academia and into practice.}

First, through human coding, we determine whether student essays submitted as homework were created by humans or software, and second, we examine these essays' sentiment and authorship, as well as factors determining the use of artificial intelligence in learning. Data collection was conducted in April and May 2024 across thirty classes from twenty Hungarian high schools. Our results show that 16 % of high school students (N = 548) wrote their text-based homework assignments using artificial intelligence, though neither age nor parents' average educational level determined the use of AI in learning. Although women have more positive attitudes toward using AI for learning purposes, they are less likely to use it to complete their homework assignments. Finally, we found that fears related to artificial intelligence are general and lack specificity. Our findings have three practical implications: 1) they highlight the need for targeted educational programs to develop ethical AI use, 2) they assist teachers in identifying AI-generated texts, and 3) they draw attention to gender differences in AI usage.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study mapped the editorial policies regarding the use and acknowledgment of artificial intelligence (AI) in dental journals.
Methods
Dental journals indexed in Web of Science were analyzed. Editorial guidelines and instructions for authors and reviewers were assessed. The outcome of interest was whether a journal reported an AI policy. Exposures of interest were Journal Impact Factor (JIF), Journal Citation Indicator (JCI), total number of citations, and percentage of open access content. Associations between journal metrics and the presence of AI policies were assessed using Poisson regression models with robust standard errors. Adjusted models were developed separately for JIF and JCI, including variables with p ≤ 0.2. Significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.
Results
Among the 158 journals analyzed, 70.9 % reported AI policies. Policies targeted authors (100 %), reviewers (88.4 %), and editors (46.4 %). The most common areas addressed were authorship, language review, and writing assistance. Journals in the upper quartiles of JIF and JCI were about twice as likely to report an AI policy compared to those in the lowest quartile. In the adjusted models, no association was found between total citations and AI policy presence, whereas open access percentage showed a negative association. While AI tools are permitted to aid in language refinement, critical tasks were consistently required to remain human-led, with rare exceptions.
Conclusion
AI-related editorial policies were frequent in dental journals, and higher-impact journals were statistically more likely to report such policies.
Clinical significance
Clearer and more standardized AI policies may promote transparency and ethical AI use.}

Pulmonary nodules are critical indicators for the early detection of lung cancer; however, their diagnosis and management pose significant challenges due to the variability in nodule characteristics, reader fatigue, and limited clinical expertise, often leading to diagnostic errors. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) presents promising solutions to address these issues.
Methods:
This review compares traditional rule-based methods, handcrafted feature-based machine learning, radiomics, deep learning, and hybrid models incorporating Transformers or attention mechanisms. It systematically compares their methodologies, clinical applications (diagnosis, treatment, prognosis), and dataset usage to evaluate performance, applicability, and limitations in pulmonary nodule management.
Results:
AI advances have significantly improved pulmonary nodule management, with transformer-based models achieving leading accuracy in segmentation, classification, and subtyping. The fusion of multimodal imaging CT, PET, and MRI further enhances diagnostic precision. Additionally, AI aids treatment planning and prognosis prediction by integrating radiomics with clinical data. Despite these advances, challenges remain, including domain shift, high computational demands, limited interpretability, and variability across multi-center datasets.
Conclusion:
Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformative potential in improving the diagnosis and treatment of lung nodules, especially in improving the accuracy of lung cancer treatment and patient prognosis, where significant progress has been made.}

These findings are particularly important given that many of these interventions are brief and self-administered, making them both accessible and scalable for large populations. However, the efficacy of positive psychology interventions is often constrained by small effect sizes. In light of advancements in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), this study explored whether integrating AI chatbots into positive psychology interventions could enhance their efficacy compared to traditional self-administered approaches. Study 1 examined the efficacy of a gratitude intervention delivered through Snapchat's My AI, while Study 2 evaluated a self-affirmation intervention integrated with a customized ChatGPT. Both studies employed within-subject experimental designs. Contrary to our hypotheses, the integration of AI did not yield incremental improvements in gratitude outcomes (Study 1), or self-view outcomes (Study 2) compared to existing non-AI interventions. However, exploratory analyses revealed that the AI-integrated self-affirmation intervention significantly enhanced life satisfaction and medium-arousal positive affect, suggesting potential benefits for selected well-being outcomes. These findings indicate that while AI integration in brief, self-administered positive psychology interventions may enhance certain outcomes, its suitability varies across intervention types. Further research is needed to better understand the contexts in which AI can effectively augment positive psychology interventions.}

While XAI can help to partially interpret and explain the workings of neural networks, it has not changed their original subsymbolic nature and the opaque statistical nature of their workings. Significant uncertainties remain about the safety, reliability, and accountability of modern neural network AI solutions. Here we present a novel AI method that has a fully transparent white-box nature - eXplicitly eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XXAI). XXAI is implemented on deterministic cellular automata whose rules are based on first principles of the problem domain. XXAI overcomes the limitations for a broader application of symbolic AI. The practical value of XXAI lies in its ability to make autonomous, fully transparent decisions due to its multi-component, multi-level, networked, hyper-logical nature. Looking ahead, XXAI has the potential to become a leading strategic partner in the field of neuro-symbolic hybrid AI systems. XXAI is able to systematically validate neural network solutions, ensuring that the required standards of reliability, security and ethics are met throughout the AI lifecycle, from training to deployment. By creating a clear cognitive framework, XXAI will enable the development of advanced autonomous solutions to achieve the human-centric values of the future Industry 5.0.

A systematic review methodology, following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, was employed to analyse studies from 2017 to 2025, identifying the AI algorithms most frequently used to personalise gaming experiences, improve patient engagement, and increase treatment efficacy. Our proposal categorises the algorithms based on their role in the game environment, which can either be game control or user assessment. Game control algorithms adapt the game environment and difficulty, while user assessment algorithms gather information about the player's state, such as performance, mood, or physiological data, to evaluate the treatment progress. The review also examines the growing trend of using multimodal data as input for machine learning models. Results show that a few well-known algorithms, such as Decision Trees (DT), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are frequently used. However, there is a clear distinction in their purposes: while FL is typically applied to game control tasks, SVMs are mainly used for user assessment.

abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease is marked by significant clinical heterogeneity, posing challenges for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies. Conventional approaches, such as endoscopy and histology, often fail to adequately and accurately predict medium- and long-term outcomes, leading to suboptimal patient management. Artificial intelligence is emerging as a transformative force enabling standardized, accurate, and timely disease assessment and outcome prediction, including therapeutic response. Artificial intelligence–driven intestinal barrier healing assessment provides novel insights into deep healing, facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. In addition, the automated integration of multi-omics data can enhance patient profiling and personalized management strategies. The future of inflammatory bowel disease care lies in the artificial intelligence–enabled "endo-histo-omics" integrative real-time approach, harmoniously fusing endoscopic, histologic, and molecular data. Despite challenges in its adoption, this paradigm shift has the potential to refine risk stratification, improve therapeutic precision, and enable personalized interventions, ultimately advancing the implementation of precision medicine in routine clinical practice.}

Intelligent analysis and classification systems are significantly superior to visual diagnostic methods used by dermatologists and oncologists. However, the application of such systems in clinical practice is severely limited due to a lack of generalizability and risks of potential misclassification. Successful implementation of artificial intelligence-based tools into clinicopathological practice requires a comprehensive study of the effectiveness and performance of existing models, as well as further promising areas for potential research development. The purpose of this systematic review is to investigate and evaluate the accuracy of artificial intelligence technologies for detecting malignant forms of pigmented skin lesions. For the study, 10,589 scientific research and review articles were selected from electronic scientific publishers, of which 171 articles were included in the presented systematic review. All selected scientific articles are distributed according to the proposed neural network algorithms from machine learning to multimodal intelligent architectures and are described in the corresponding sections of the manuscript. This research aims to explore automated skin cancer recognition systems, from simple machine learning algorithms to multimodal ensemble systems based on advanced encoder-decoder models, visual transformers (ViT), and generative and spiking neural networks. In addition, as a result of the analysis, future directions of research, prospects, and potential for further development of automated neural network systems for classifying pigmented skin lesions are discussed.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied in medicine, with growing interest in its potential to improve outcomes in cardiac arrest (CA). However, the scope and characteristics of current AI applications in resuscitation remain unclear.
Methods
This scoping review aims to map the existing literature on AI applications in CA and resuscitation and identify research gaps for further investigation. PRISMA-ScR framework and ILCOR guidelines were followed. A systematic literature search across PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane identified AI applications in resuscitation. Articles were screened and classified by AI methodology, study design, outcomes, and implementation settings. AI-assisted data extraction was manually validated for accuracy.
Results
Out of 4046 records, 197 studies met inclusion criteria. Most were retrospective (90%), with only 16 prospective studies and 2 randomised controlled trials. AI was predominantly applied in prediction of CA, rhythm classification, and post-resuscitation outcome prognostication. Machine learning was the most commonly used method (50% of studies), followed by deep learning and, less frequently, natural language processing. Reported performance was generally high, with AUROC values often exceeding 0.85; however, external validation was rare and real-world implementation limited.
Conclusions
While AI applications in resuscitation demonstrate encouraging performance in prediction and decision support tasks, clear evidence of improved patient outcomes or routine clinical use remains limited. Future research should focus on prospective validation, equity in data sources, explainability, and seamless integration of AI tools into clinical workflows.}

A total of 573 Hong Kong secondary and university students participated in a 14-h course. Data was collected through the AI Ethical Awareness Scale (AIEAS) questionnaire and students' self-reflective writings. The AIEAS framework, encompassing three dimensions, was based on the Belmont Report principles of human autonomy, beneficence, and fairness. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported this three-factor structure, with nine items retained. Multigroup CFA results demonstrated strong measurement invariance across gender, education level, and programming knowledge. All Cronbach's alpha and omega coefficient values exceeded 0.70, indicating satisfactory internal consistency and fair temporal stability. Furthermore, students' ethical awareness showed a significant improvement following the course intervention. This study not only provides a robust measure for researchers and practitioners to assess students' ethical awareness through behavioural engagement but also demonstrates the necessity of implementing an education course for cultivating ethical awareness through integrating experience and reflection.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
The automated segmentation of maxillary and mandibular bones in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using artificial intelligence (AI) is redefining the standards of digital dentistry and orthodontics, with applications in mini-implant placement, dental implantology, orthognathic surgery, and bone graft planning.
Objective
To systematically assess the performance of AI models – particularly U-Net-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) – for automated segmentation of maxillary bone structures in CBCT, following the PICOS model (Population – CBCT scans of human maxillae; Intervention – AI-based segmentation; Comparator – manual segmentation; Outcome – accuracy; Study design – diagnostic accuracy studies).
Material and methods
This systematic review adhered to PRISMA 2020 guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024592182). Eligibility criteria included studies applying AI to maxillary bone segmentation in CBCT and reporting quantitative accuracy metrics. Risk of bias was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. The GRADE tool for formulating and grading recommendations in clinical practice was also employed. Data collected comprised number of CBCT scans, AI model architecture, evaluation metrics, and reported clinical applications.
Results
Thirty-one studies, analysing 11,432 CBCT scans, met the inclusion criteria. AI models consistently achieved high segmentation accuracy, with Dice similarity coefficients frequently exceeding 0.98, while substantially reducing processing time compared to manual segmentation. Applications ranged from implant planning and orthognathic surgery to digital orthodontics. Persistent challenges included anatomical variability, imaging artifacts, and the limited availability of high-quality annotated datasets.
Conclusions
AI-based segmentation of maxillary and mandibular bones in CBCT demonstrates promising accuracy and efficiency compared with manual techniques. Nevertheless, the certainty of evidence is limited by retrospective designs and small, heterogeneous samples. Large-scale, prospective multicentre studies with standardized evaluation are needed before these methods can be reliably adopted in routine clinical practice.}

In this paper, we revised and expanded upon the TTT; by including a new stage of assessment (i.e. testing simulated conversations) and providing further guidance on the phases of the TTT. First, the CA is tested in a safe environment with simulated clients (with Gen AI), instead of human clients; second, the TTT is conducted with a selected sample of actual users; and third, the TTT is conducted with a large sample of users. Adopting this innovative assessment method will guide the future development of mental health CAs, ensuring AI-led interventions meet the rigorous standards expected of human therapists.}

Coronary artery disease (CAD) manifests differently between sexes, with data suggesting females develop more non-calcified plaques that traditional calcium-centric tools may not detect.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 100 individuals with low total atheroma volume (TAV) < 250 mm3 using artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) to assess sex-based differences in coronary plaque composition. Plaque subtypes included calcified, non-calcified, and low-density non-calcified atheroma volumes.
Results
Females had significantly lower total (p = 0.018) and non-calcified plaque (p < 0.001) burden compared to males. Calcified (p = 0.52) and low-density non-calcified (p = 0.16) plaque volumes did not differ significantly. Age was a consistent predictor of plaque volume across most subtypes.
Conclusions
Despite low overall plaque burden, males demonstrated a higher non-calcified plaque burden than females. This finding contrasts with previous literature and underscores the potential of AI-enabled CCTA to detect subclinical coronary disease, particularly in low-risk cohorts. These results support the use of comprehensive plaque profiling in both sexes to improve early risk stratification.}

abstract = {Background
Bioavailability, defined as the extent to which active components in food are absorbed and utilized by the body, is a critical factor in determining the health benefits of food. The intricate interactions of various critical aspects, particularly those concerning extensive, complicated datasets of host conditions and ingredient matrix effects, are obstacles to bioavailability research. These difficulties influence research on intestinal absorption efficiency, solubility, and chemical stability.
Scope and approach
One effective tool for overcoming these challenges is artificial intelligence (AI). AI models can be used to analyse and forecast the bioavailability of food ingredients under various processing conditions and food matrix compositions by analyzing sizable datasets, as well as reveal the effects of these parameters. The aims of this review are to provide a theoretical foundation for AI-based bioavailability research, describe applicable methods, outline prospective research directions for AI-based innovation in food science and nutrition, and address existing difficulties.
Key findings and conclusions
The use of AI in bioavailability research on proteins, peptides, carbohydrates, and micronutrients has transformative potential. AI-based models can be used to simultaneously deduce structures, optimize excipient ingredients, devise distribution systems, offer research guidance and minimize experimental trials. However, the application of these models is hampered by the following factors: (1) the absence of high-quality standardized datasets that accurately represent biological complexity, which may result in model overfitting and bias; (2) the restricted mechanistic interpretability of "black box" algorithms, which impedes regulatory approval and scientific validation; and (3) interdisciplinary validation challenges between computational predictions and in vitro and in vivo experimental outcomes.}

The Blueprint lists “notice and explanation” as one of five principles fundamental to delivering consumer protections as artificial intelligence (AI) is developed and used. This qualitative assessment of 40 company websites evaluates the extent to which privacy/AI notices align with this call for AI transparency. The assessment assigns full, half, or zero stars on ten transparency criteria, including (among others): whether notices are accessible via company websites and in plain language, reference applicable laws, explain how AI systems work, their risks, data retention policies, and data storage/processing policies. Findings suggest companies convey privacy transparency elements but disclose few details about the use/implications of AI. The average score across the sample is 2.95/10 stars. Each company provides homepage access to notices and information about applicable law. Many provide details about data storage/processing though only eighteen describe data retention. While some provide minimal definitions of automated systems, few explain how AI systems work or the risks of use. 34/40 require a grade twelve or higher reading-level, and most provide AI details away from the privacy policy. To support the auditability of AI systems via consent-based protections companies should improve upon these transparency efforts. Companies should better-align with calls for AI transparency like those from the Biden White House, currently accessible via the U.S. National Archives. Accessible and plain language notices are recommended, as are details about how AI systems work, and the implications of AI development and use.}

However, traditional data trading models face significant challenges, including privacy concerns, pricing mechanisms, transaction efficiency, and decentralization. Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a transformative approach to data trading by enabling local intelligence, privacy-preserving computation, and decentralized architectures. This paper explores the integration of Edge AI with data trading, analyzing its technical foundations, key challenges, and diverse applications. Edge AI enhances data trading by reducing data transmission costs, enabling privacy-preserving federated learning, and facilitating decentralized trust mechanisms through blockchain. Compared to centralized models, Edge AI-based data trading supports secure, efficient, and transparent transactions while mitigating the data misuse. This paradigm benefits various domains, including IoT-enabled smart factories and connected vehicles, financial risk assessment and credit scoring, secure electronic health record sharing, supply chain optimization, and personalized advertising. Despite its advantages, Edge AI-driven data trading still faces challenges in standardization, security, computational efficiency, data quality assessment, and regulatory compliance. Future research should focus on establishing global data trading protocols, optimizing privacy-preserving mechanisms, and improving decentralized transaction models to enhance security and efficiency. Edge AI-enabled data trading will play an increasingly vital role in facilitating trustworthy and efficient data markets across digital industries.}

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) have dominated public interest due to their apparent capability to accurately replicate learned knowledge in narrative text. However, there is a lack of clarity about the accuracy and capability standards of LLMs in health care examinations.
Objective
We conducted a systematic review of LLM accuracy, as tested under health care examination conditions, as compared to known human performance standards.
Methods
We quantified the accuracy of LLMs in responding to health care examination questions and evaluated the consistency and quality of study reporting. The search included all papers up until September 10, 2023, with all LLMs published in English journals that report clear LLM accuracy standards. The exclusion criteria were as follows: the assessment was not a health care exam, there was no LLM, there was no evaluation of comparable success accuracy, and the literature was not original research.The literature search included the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms used in all possible combinations: “artificial intelligence,” “ChatGPT,” “GPT,” “LLM,” “large language model,” “machine learning,” “neural network,” “Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” “Generative Transformer,” “Generative Language Model,” “Generative Model,” “medical exam,” “healthcare exam,” and “clinical exam.” Sensitivity, accuracy, and precision data were extracted, including relevant CIs.
Results
The search identified 1673 relevant citations. After removing duplicate results, 1268 (75.8%) papers were screened for titles and abstracts, and 32 (2.5%) studies were included for full-text review. Our meta-analysis suggested that LLMs are able to perform with an overall medical examination accuracy of 0.61 (CI 0.58-0.64) and a United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) accuracy of 0.51 (CI 0.46-0.56), while Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) can perform with an overall medical examination accuracy of 0.64 (CI 0.6-0.67).
Conclusions
LLMs offer promise to remediate health care demand and staffing challenges by providing accurate and efficient context-specific information to critical decision makers. For policy and deployment decisions about LLMs to advance health care, we proposed a new framework called RUBRICC (Regulatory, Usability, Bias, Reliability [Evidence and Safety], Interoperability, Cost, and Codesign–Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement [PPIE]). This presents a valuable opportunity to direct the clinical commissioning of new LLM capabilities into health services, while respecting patient safety considerations.

abstract = {The physical interactions between proteins are largely determined by the structural properties at their binding interfaces. It was found that the binding interfaces in distinctive protein complexes are highly similar. The structural properties underlying different binding interfaces could be further captured by artificial intelligence. In order to test this hypothesis, we broke protein-protein binding interfaces into pairs of interacting fragments. We employed a generative model to encode these interface fragment pairs in a low-dimensional latent space. After training, new conformations of interface fragment pairs were generated. We found that, by only using a small number of interface fragment pairs that were generated by artificial intelligence, we were able to guide the assembly of protein complexes into their native conformations. These results demonstrate that the conformational space of fragment pairs at protein-protein binding interfaces is highly degenerate. Features in this degenerate space can be well characterized by artificial intelligence. In summary, our machine learning method will be potentially useful to search for and predict the conformations of unknown protein-protein interactions.}

Adopting data and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is essential to ensure efficient operations and informed decision making and to keep a competitive market advantage.

The proposed architecture incorporates edge computing, autonomous AI agents, and federated learning to enable real-time, privacy-preserving analytics at the farm level and promote knowledge sharing and refinement through research farms and cloud collaboration. Farms collect heterogeneous data, which can be transformed into embeddings for both local inference and cloud analysis. These embeddings form the input of AI agents that support health monitoring, risk prediction, operational optimization, and decision making. Privacy is preserved by sharing only model weights or anonymized data externally. The edge layer handles time-sensitive tasks and communicates with a centralized enterprise cloud hosting global models and distributing updates. A research and development cloud linked to research farms ensures model testing and validation. The entire system is orchestrated by autonomous AI agents that manage data, choose models, and interact with stakeholders, and human oversight ensures safe decisions, as illustrated in the practical use case of mastitis management. This architecture could support data integrity, scalability, and real-time personalization, along with opening up space for partnerships between farms, research institutions, and regulatory bodies to promote secure, cross-sector innovation.}

Secondly, the automatic generation of layout design is realized by constantly adjusting the model parameters and network structure. Finally, various AI layout design algorithms are compared, and their effects and performances in layout design generation are analyzed. To verify the layout and composition matching model's performance, traditional layout design methods are selected for comparison (layout, comparison, harmonic composition, etc.). This study involved 20 design students as participants, evaluating them across three dimensions: overall comprehensive assessment, readability of text information, and rationality of visual path using a Likert 7-point scale. The results reveal that the proposed method's evaluation outcomes in these three aspects are 5.95, 5.68, and 5.74, respectively, higher than the traditional layout design methods.

abstract = {Thyroid eye disease (TED) is a common, complex orbital disorder characterized by soft-tissue changes visible on imaging. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promises for improving TED diagnosis and treatment; however, no systematic review has yet characterized the research landscape, key challenges, and future directions. We followed PRISMA guidelines to search multiple databases until January, 2025, for studies applying AI to computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear, facial or retinal imaging in TED patients. Using the APPRAISE-AI tool, we assessed study quality and included 41 studies covering various AI applications. Sample sizes ranged from 33 to 2288 participants, predominantly East Asian. CT and facial imaging were the most common modalities, reported in 16 and 13 articles, respectively. Studies addressed clinical tasks—diagnosis, activity assessment, severity classification, and treatment prediction—and technical tasks—classification, segmentation, and image generation—with classification being the most frequent. Researchers primarily employed deep-learning models, such as residual network (ResNet) and Visual Geometry Group (VGG). Overall, the majority of the studies were of moderate quality. Image-based AI shows strong potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and guide personalized treatment strategies in TED. Future research should prioritize robust study designs, the creation of public datasets, multimodal imaging integration, and interdisciplinary collaboration to accelerate clinical translation.}

abstract = {Background
Use of artificial intelligence to generate personal statements for residency is currently not permitted but is difficult to monitor. This study sought to evaluate the ability of surgical residency application reviewers to identify artificial intelligence–generated personal statements and to understand perceptions of this practice.
Methods
Three personal statements were generated using ChatGPT, and 3 were written by medical students who previously matched into surgery residency. Blinded participants at a single institution were instructed to read all personal statements and identify which were generated by artificial intelligence; they then completed a survey exploring their opinions regarding artificial intelligence use.
Results
Of the 30 participants, 50% were faculty (n = 15) and 50% were residents (n = 15). Overall, experience ranged from 0 to 20 years (median, 2 years; interquartile range, 1–6.25 years). Artificial intelligence–derived personal statements were identified correctly only 59% of the time, with 3 (10%) participants identifying all the artificial intelligence–derived personal statements correctly. Artificial intelligence–generated personal statements were labeled as the best 60% of the time and the worst 43.3% of the time. When asked whether artificial intelligence use should be allowed in personal statements writing, 66.7% (n = 20) said no and 30% (n = 9) said yes. When asked if the use of artificial intelligence would impact their opinion of an applicant, 80% (n = 24) said yes, and 20% (n = 6) said no. When survey questions and ability to identify artificial intelligence–generated personal statements were evaluated by faculty/resident status and experience, no differences were noted (P > .05).
Conclusion
This study shows that surgical faculty and residents cannot reliably identify artificial intelligence–generated personal statements and that concerns exist regarding the impact of artificial intelligence on the application process.}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming speech-language pathology (SLP) and dysphagia management, offering innovative solutions for assessment, diagnosis, and rehabilitation. This narrative review examines AI applications in these fields from 2014 to 2024, with particular focus on implementation challenges in Latin America. We analyze key AI technologies—including deep learning, machine learning algorithms, and natural language processing—that have demonstrated high accuracy in detecting voice disorders, analyzing swallowing function, and supporting personalized rehabilitation. The review identifies three primary domains of AI application: diagnostic tools with improved sensitivity for speech-language disorders, rehabilitation technologies that enable customized therapy, and telehealth platforms that expand access to specialized care in underserved regions. However, significant barriers persist, particularly in Latin America, where limited infrastructure, insufficient linguistic adaptation, and scarce regional datasets hamper widespread implementation. Our pilot study evaluating commercially available large language models for rehabilitation planning demonstrates their potential utility in generating structured therapy activities, especially in resource-constrained settings. While AI shows promise in enhancing clinical workflows and expanding service delivery, the evidence suggests that current applications remain predominantly focused on diagnosis rather than integrated rehabilitation. This review highlights the need for culturally and linguistically adapted AI models, expanded regional research collaborations, and regulatory frameworks that ensure ethical AI integration into SLP and dysphagia care, positioning these technologies as complementary tools that enhance rather than replace clinical expertise.}

This study examines how AI adoption influences marketing performance through dynamic capabilities and organizational flexibility in the context of student entrepreneurship education. Drawing on a longitudinal survey of 434 student entrepreneurs across universities in Eastern China, we employ a dual-stage analytical framework combining PLS-SEM and fsQCA to investigate the multifaceted relationships between AI drivers, dynamic capabilities, and marketing outcomes. Our findings reveal that technology-driven, organization-driven, environment-driven, and human-driven factors of AI positively influence students' dynamic capabilities—sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring—which subsequently enhance their AI-enabled marketing performance. Organizational flexibility emerges as a significant positive moderator in this relationship. The fsQCA analysis identifies six configurations leading to optimal marketing performance, providing nuanced insights for curriculum design. These findings contribute to management education literature by demonstrating how AI integration can enhance entrepreneurial learning outcomes and inform pedagogical approaches. The study offers practical implications for educators seeking to prepare students for AI-driven business environments while advancing responsible management education aligned with sustainable development goals.}

abstract = {Purpose
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) enables banks to enhance customer service experiences. However, limited research has been conducted on factors influencing customers’ intention to switch from traditional to artificial intelligence (AI) based banking services. Therefore, the present study explored the key antecedents of the aforementioned intention.
Methods
This two-stage study was based on the push–pull–mooring model. In Stage 1, in-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with stakeholders related to AI-based banking services to identify critical factors influencing customers’ intention to switch from traditional to AI-based customer services. In Stage 2, the results obtained in Stage 1 were combined with results from the literature to create a second-order model and direct-effect model (Models 1 and 2, respectively). Quantitative survey data were then collected to validate these models.
Results
Model 1 indicated that among pull, push, and mooring factors, pull factors had the strongest effect on the aforementioned intention, followed by mooring factors and then push factors. The explanatory power (R2) of this model was 70 %. Furthermore, Model 2 indicated that the attractiveness of the alternative (a pull factor) and the need for interpersonal interaction and inertia (mooring factors) were the key factors influencing switching intention. The explanatory power (R2) of this model was 76 %.
Conclusion
In summary, this study identified and validated critical factors affecting customers’ intention to switch to AI-based banking services. The findings enrich the understanding the social interaction and user behavior of AI, offering valuable insights for promoting AI-driven services and applications.}
