However, training a language model for domain-specific tasks is hugely costly and requires high computational power, thereby restricting its true potential for standard tasks. This study, therefore, provides a comprehensive analysis of the latest pre-trained LLMs for various NLP-related applications without fine-tuning them to evaluate their effectiveness. Five language models are thus employed in this study on six distinct NLP tasks (including emotion recognition, sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, irony detection, offensiveness detection, and stance detection) for 12 languages from low- to medium- and high-resource. Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) and Gemini Pro outperform state-of-the-art models, achieving average F1 scores of 70.6% and 68.8% on the Tweet Sentiment Multilingual dataset compared to the state-of-the-art average F1 score of 66.8%.

Food-derived bioactive peptides (FBPs) play a vital role in nutrition and health. Traditional experimental approaches for identifying FBPs are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. In contrast, computational approaches, for example, virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations, have their own limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology enables high-throughput screening and analysis of activity mechanisms for FBPs. Ongoing AI research will enhance the in-depth development and application of FBPs.
Scope and approach
This review outlines the general process of AI screening for FBPs, including data foundation, molecular feature representation, machine learning and deep learning model construction and training, as well as evaluation and validation. It also summarizes recent research advances in AI screening of FBPs with different bioactivities, discusses current key issues and challenges, and highlights future research directions and trends of FBPs.
Key findings and conclusions
Significant advancements have been made in utilizing AI screening methods to identify functional FBPs with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, flavor-enhancing, and hypotensive properties, while the research on anti-obesity and anti-fatigue peptides is still at a nascent stage. Deep learning has demonstrated clear predictive advantages over traditional machine learning techniques. However, challenges remain when screening for peptides with different biological activities. Moving forward, data augmentation strategies should be developed within food-specific large models, and a universal deep learning framework based on multi-scale chemical space features should be created to predict peptide-target dynamic interactions. A high-throughput screening framework should be established, alongside enhanced research on AI methods for multifunctional properties like anti-obesity and anti-fatigue effects.}

Artificial Intelligence tools are being introduced in almost every field of human life, including medical sciences and medical education, among scepticism and enthusiasm.
Research question
to assess how a generative language tool (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3.5, ChatGPT) performs at both generating questions and answering a neurosurgical residents’ written exam. Namely, to assess how ChatGPT generates questions, how it answers human-generated questions, how residents answer AI-generated questions and how AI answers its self-generated question.
Materials and methods
50 questions were included in the written exam, 46 questions were generated by humans (senior staff members) and 4 were generated by ChatGPT. 11 participants took the exam (ChatGPT and 10 residents). Questions were both open-ended and multiple-choice. 8 questions were not submitted to ChatGPT since they contained images or schematic drawings to interpret.
Results
formulating requests to ChatGPT required an iterative process to precise both questions and answers. Chat GPT scored among the lowest ranks (9/11) among all the participants). There was no difference in response rate for residents’ between human-generated vs AI-generated questions that could have been attributed to less clarity of the question. ChatGPT answered correctly to all its self-generated questions.
Discussion and conclusions
AI is a promising and powerful tool for medical education and for specific medical purposes, which need to be further determined. To request AI to generate logical and sound questions, that request must be formulated as precise as possible, framing the content, the type of question and its correct answers.}

abstract = {Objectives
Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are essential for synthesizing high-quality evidence in clinical research, health economics and outcomes research, and health technology assessments. However, the growing volume of published data has made SLRs time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly. To address these challenges, we introduce A4SLR, an agentic artificial-intelligence-assisted SLR framework, which provides a flexible, extensible methodology for automating the entire SLR process-from initial query formulation to evidence synthesis-across various study fields.
Methods
A4SLR comprises 8 modules integrated with specialized artificial intelligence agents powered by large language models: search, I/E criteria deployment, abstract/full-text screening, text/table pre-processing, data extraction, assessment, risk of bias analysis, and report. We implemented and validated this framework using 2 use cases, non-small cell lung cancer and perinatal mood and anxiety disorders. Performance of the assessment was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively.
Results
Our implementation demonstrated high accuracy in article screening (F1 scores: 0.917-0.977), risk of bias assessment (Cohen’s k: 0.8442-0.9064), and data extraction (F-scores: 0.96-0.998), including patient characteristics, safety and efficacy outcomes, economic model parameters, and cost-effectiveness data. Notably, the text/table preprocessing agent yielded comprehensive coverage of data elements, particularly in the challenging tasks of accurately matching outcome values to their corresponding study arms.
Conclusions
Our findings highlight the potential of the A4SLR framework to transform the evidence synthesis process by addressing the limitations of manual SLRs, thereby enhancing health economics and outcomes research and health technology assessments. Designed as a scalable, user-centric, extensible approach, A4SLR provides a robust solution for generating comprehensive up-to-date evidence to support researchers and decision makers across diverse clinical and therapeutic areas.}

abstract = {The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) in educational settings has attracted considerable interest from scholars, specifically in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education. While prior research has explored AI’s instructional benefits, limited attention has been given to its impact on learners’ emotional and psychological dimensions—specifically motivation, psychological well-being (PWB), and psychological capital (PsyCap). This research examines the influence of AI tools on the motivation, PWB, and PsyCap of EFL students. To evaluate these effects, a pre-test was administered utilizing three validated scales that measure motivation, PWB, and PsyCap. After this initial evaluation, subjects were assigned to two groups, namely, receiving traditional instruction and participating in AI-based instructional methods. After the instructional sessions, both groups completed a post-test using the same questionnaires to assess alterations in the three variables. The data gathered from the pre-test and post-test were analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), which indicated that there were notable differences in the post-test scores between the two groups concerning positive motivation, PsyCap, and PWB. Particularly, the integration of AI tools was found to markedly improve students' motivation, PWB, and PsyCap. These results suggest that AI tools not only boost language acquisition but also contribute meaningfully to learners' motivation and PsyCap. Implications include the need for educators and policymakers to consider AI integration not just for academic outcomes, but for cultivating emotionally supported learning environments in EFL contexts.}

For the microcosm of colorectal surgery, AI can assist in specimen acquisition, pathologic and radiologic diagnosis, selection of treatment modality, pre/postoperative risk stratification, and more globally in surgeon education, grantsmanship, and claims assessment. However, with such power comes the risk of its abuse, and subsequent harm to patients (and providers). Understanding a brief history of AI and the hierarchy of the predominant forms with which we interact, allow us to better understand the nature of these risks and how we can apply ethical frameworks to better understand and mitigate/prevent them.

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved through various trends, with different subfields gaining prominence over time. Currently, conversational AI—particularly generative AI—is at the forefront. Conversational AI models are primarily focused on text-based tasks and are commonly deployed as chatbots. Recent advancements by OpenAI have enabled the integration of external, independently developed models, allowing chatbots to perform specialized, task-oriented functions beyond general language processing.
Objective
This study aims to develop a smart chatbot that integrates large language models from OpenAI with specialized domain-specific models, such as those used in medical image diagnostics. The system leverages transfer learning via Google’s Teachable Machine to construct image-based classifiers and incorporates a diabetes detection model developed in TensorFlow.js. A key innovation is the chatbot’s ability to extract relevant parameters from user input, trigger the appropriate diagnostic model, interpret the output, and deliver responses in natural language. The overarching goal is to demonstrate the potential of combining large language models with external models to build multimodal, task-oriented conversational agents.
Methods
Two image-based models were developed and integrated into the chatbot system. The first analyzes chest X-rays to detect viral and bacterial pneumonia. The second uses optical coherence tomography images to identify ocular conditions such as drusen, choroidal neovascularization, and diabetic macular edema. Both models were incorporated into the chatbot to enable image-based medical query handling. In addition, a text-based model was constructed to process physiological measurements for diabetes prediction using TensorFlow.js. The architecture is modular; new diagnostic models can be added without redesigning the chatbot, enabling straightforward functional expansion.
Results
The findings demonstrate effective integration between the chatbot and the diagnostic models, with only minor deviations from expected behavior. Additionally, a stub function was implemented within the chatbot to schedule medical appointments based on the severity of a patient’s condition, and it was specifically tested with the optical coherence tomography and X-ray models.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing advanced AI systems—including image-based diagnostic models and chatbot integration—by leveraging AI as a service. It also underscores the potential of AI to enhance user experiences in bioinformatics, paving the way for more intuitive and accessible interfaces in the field. Looking ahead, the modular nature of the chatbot allows for the integration of additional diagnostic models as the system evolves.}

To train an AI model, however, a large dataset is typically required, especially when using the most powerful techniques. Therefore, not all specialties are taking advantage of AI techniques in the same way. For instance, they are seldomly used in areas such as the diagnosis of rare diseases since, due to their low prevalence, not enough data are typically available to train an AI model. In this paper, we address the use of AI techniques to diagnose a particular rare disease: Collagen VI-related Congenital Muscular Dystrophy from confocal microscopy images. We apply both classical machine learning and modern deep learning techniques and we show that, when using the appropriate data management and training procedures, one can successfully derive a highly-accurate classifier even with a limited amount of training data. Due to the generality of the explored techniques, this conclusion is likely to hold also for most of the rare diseases whose diagnosis relies on the examination of histological images.}

Grounded in Porter’s Five Forces framework—specifically the threat of substitutes—this commentary explores whether AI can adequately fulfill the complex and relational functions of pharmacists in delivering patient care. Drawing from foundational definitions of pharmaceutical care and economic theories of substitution, the paper examines both historical and emerging competitors to pharmacist-provided services, including physicians, nurses, and now AI-powered tools. Rather than assert a binary conclusion about AI’s ability to replace pharmacists, this paper identifies conditions under which substitution may be more or less likely. Key factors include the nature of the pharmaceutical care service, patient preferences, the quality and accessibility of AI tools, and regulatory and institutional constraints. Using examples from practice and education, the commentary highlights areas where AI may function as a substitute—such as information delivery or curricular mapping—and others where human oversight remains essential. Ultimately, the question is not whether AI will serve as a substitute, but to what extent, under what circumstances, and with what implications for pharmacy educators. Preparing students for a professional environment augmented by AI requires a shift in educational strategies, with a focus on adaptability, data literacy, and meaningful integration of emerging technologies.}

This review explores the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in ESCC screening. AI technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning, demonstrate remarkable potential for early ESCC screening by targeting high-risk populations, optimizing screening modalities, refining screening intervals, and enhancing cost-effectiveness. AI-driven systems improve lesion detection, vascular pattern recognition, and risk prediction by integrating imaging, genomic, and clinical data. Additionally, AI applications in liquid biopsy analysis enable non-invasive detection of circulating tumor cells and DNA, further advancing early diagnosis.

To address this gap, drawing on theory of planned behavior (TPB), the present quantitative study employed a survey with 283 EFL students from different Chinese universities. The results of a one-sample t-test and descriptive statistics revealed that Chinese EFL students had demonstrated an above-average level of AI readiness in their L2 education reflecting the three dimensions of TPB (i.e., attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control) through an emphasis on positive attitudes towards and intentions to adopt AI tools. They also showed higher than average scores in three sub-factors of AI readiness (i.e., ethics, ability, and vision). Only the cognitive dimension was below the average point.

abstract = {Fruits and vegetables are high in moisture content and rich in nutrients, but are perishable and have a short shelf life. Drying is a crucial technology to extend shelf life and reduce resource waste. However, traditional drying methods are limited by low efficiency, high energy consumption, and unstable product quality. Artificial intelligence (AI), with its self-learning, adaptive capabilities and ability of modeling complex non-linear relationships, offers innovative solutions and effective tools to tackle these issues. This paper provides a comprehensive review of AI applications in fruits and vegetables drying. First, we introduce the fundamental theories of machine learning, deep learning, fuzzy logic, expert system, computer vision system and their application advantages in fruits and vegetables drying. Subsequently, we elaborate case studies of AI in drying process modeling and predicting, real-time quality monitoring, and intelligent control and optimization, and discusses their applications in optimizing traditional drying and integrating with field-assisted drying techniques. Moreover, the limitations of AI in fruits and vegetables drying and their future development trends are analyzed to offer additional insights for researchers in the field.}

abstract = {Applications based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) are increasingly being adopted, especially since tools like ChatGPT or Dall-E have become available to the public and have gained popularity. While its benefits are manifold, AI also has a significant environmental impact: AI technology usually relies on hardware which consumes a significant amount of energy, such as GPU servers. Furthermore, users normally access AI-based services via their own end devices, which also consume energy. The energy side of training and using AI models can be roughly estimated today, for example using libraries like CodeCarbon. However, a realistic estimate of AI’s environmental impact needs to include not only the energy consumption from the use of the AI, but also factors such as the (critical) raw materials needed for the construction of the hardware, and the consumption of materials and energy for the maintenance and use of the hardware throughout its life cycle. This is not feasible today. Systematic life cycle assessment of AI technology is still in its infancy. It should not be limited to calculating the CO2-equivalent, but take into account different relevant environmental impact indicators from resource use depletion to human toxicity to water consumption. This paper reviews the literature on this topic, identifies gaps and opportunities for research and argues for developing an LCA methodology for AI. It further presents an adaptation of an existing LCA methodology to AI as a first step in this direction.}

Using a quantitative correlational approach, data were collected from 422 university professors across eight institutions in northern Peru. The research employed structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to test a hypothetical model comprising five constructs: perceived ethics, bias in AI, teacher concerns, AI literacy, and AI implementation. The results revealed two significant relationships: AI literacy strongly influences AI implementation, and bias in AI significantly affects AI literacy. In contrast to expectations, perceived ethics and teacher concerns had no significant influence on AI literacy. Additionally, demographic variables (age and gender) had no moderating effects on the relationships between the constructs. The findings suggest that enhancing AI literacy and addressing algorithmic bias are crucial factors for successful AI integration in higher education, whereas ethical considerations and teacher concerns may play a less significant role than previously theorized. This research contributes to understanding the dynamics of AI adoption in Latin American higher education and provides practical insights for developing more effective AI implementation strategies in educational settings.}

However, traditional vaccine development methods face challenges in efficiency, cost, and response time to emerging pathogens. Recent progress in art AI and nanotechnology is revolutionizing this landscape, offering innovative solutions for vaccine design, delivery, and optimization. This manuscript examines the transformative impact of AI and nanotechnology on advancing vaccine development, highlighting their synergistic effect in overcoming traditional limitations. AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, facilitates rapid identification of immunogenic antigens and epitopes by analyzing vast genomic, proteomic, and immunological datasets. These computational tools optimize vaccine design by predicting antigen stability, immunogenicity, and efficacy, as exemplified by the expedited development of COVID-19 vaccines. Nanotechnology complements these advancements by providing engineered nanoparticles (NPs), including liposomes, polymeric NPs, and biomimetic systems, that enhance antigen delivery, stability, and immune activation. Innovations such as virus-like particles (VLPs) and immune-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs) further enhance vaccine safety and efficacy by mimicking natural infection processes to trigger robust, targeted immune responses. Integrating AI and nanotechnology presents remarkable opportunities for developing personalized immunization strategies. AI algorithms can assess individual immune profiles to design customized vaccines, while nanotechnology enables precise delivery and controlled release of antigens. This interdisciplinary approach accelerates vaccine development, ensuring both safety and efficacy, and lays the foundation for universal vaccines and cancer vaccines that target complex pathogens and non-infectious diseases. Together, AI and nanotechnology herald a new era in vaccinology, enabling the development of vaccines that are faster, more precise, and highly adaptable to emerging and complex health challenges.}

The study utilized a two-stage approach: the first involved artificial intelligence-assisted design tasks and focus group discussions with 24 participants, capturing both visual and textual data. K-means color clustering and thematic analysis were applied to images and texts. The second stage involved surveying 222 individuals and conducting a chi-square test to analyze the frequency of different color dimensions used by the two groups. The results demonstrate that differences in color perception influenced design decision-making outcomes. There was widespread acknowledgment across all groups of the efficiency and inspirational potential of artificial intelligence platforms. However, variations in design education resulted in differing opinions on the replaceability of designers. Future trajectories for artificial intelligence platforms are likely to focus on specialization while addressing challenges such as echo chamber effects, copyright disputes, and the prevention of private information leakage.}

This paper aims to contribute to a concept of a framework that allows the application of AI in model-based systems engineering (MBSE) processes of automated production systems; the main focus is hereby on the MBSE processes. The aim of the complete framework is to realize an AI-based, self-learning digital twin that automatically adapts to the real system behavior and represents an optimal image of a product and its production process at all times. An expressive, semantic overall model serves as the basis for new approaches to artificial intelligence. In the complete framework, knowledge gained using AI methods is integrated into the overall model and thus brought into an overall context. Such an overall model improves the interpretability and explainability of the AI models and enables complex analyses, simulations and forecasts. The core element of the approach is a novel, AI-based, self-learning engineering model consisting of a product and production model that maps function, behavior and product geometry. Graph-based design languages are used for forming a central data model and functional mock-up units are applied for continuous co-simulation. The approach is underlined by means of an application to the design of automated assembly systems.}

Focusing on the supply chain, this paper constructs a dataset with “focal firm - associated firm - year” observations, to examine the external spillover effects of AI on supply chain decarbonisation. Our findings reveal that AI employed by focal enterprises significantly contribute to curbing carbon emissions among associated enterprises within the supply chain, primarily through green technological innovation (GTI). The role of substantive GTI is predominant, whereas symbolic GTI appears to have an insignificant impact. Meanwhile, from the perspective of synergy, the vertical interaction effect of the supply chain and the horizontal peer effect of industry can strengthen the supply chain decarbonisation effect of AI technology. This paper provides a new synergetic insight for fully releasing the decarbonisation potential of AI based on supply chain interaction, providing empirical evidence and policy references to promote industrial green inclusive development and realize the global zero-carbon goal.}

Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary (HPB) surgery is a complex specialty and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications have the potential to improve pre- intra- and postoperative outcomes of HPB surgery. While ethics guidelines have been developed for the use of AI in clinical surgery, the ethical implications and reliability of AI in HPB surgery remain specifically unexplored.
Methods
An online survey was developed by the Innovation Committee of the E-AHPBA to investigate the current perspectives on the ethical principles and trustworthiness of AI in HPB Surgery among E-AHPBA membership. The survey consisted of 22 questions, based on guidelines outlined by the Artificial Intelligence Surgery Journal Task Force on AI Ethics in clinical surgery and was disseminated via email to all E-AHPBA members.
Results
A total of 84 members of the E-AHPBA participated in the survey. Seventeen out of 22 questions achieved more than 80 % agreement, with nine of those exceeding 90 %. Five questions had agreement levels between 70 % and 80 %.
Conclusion
While HPB surgeons are aware of the need to regulate the use of AI devices, robots, and to protect patient data, consensus appears to be heterogeneous regarding AI's role in mitigating gender-related and minority biases, as well as ensuring fairness and equity.}

We developed and investigated an integrated framework combining comprehensive generative AI literacies—functional, critical and ethical, and creative—with self-regulated learning (SRL) processes operationalized as a human-centered Plan, Iterate, Evaluate cycle. Thirty-eight undergraduate students enrolled in an “Artificial Intelligence and Writing” course completed scaffolded experiential challenges followed by self-directed creative projects. Quantitative analysis revealed significant growth in AI literacy self-efficacy across all dimensions, with students progressing from moderate initial confidence (M = 4.68, SD = 2.11) to high confidence levels (M = 8.39, SD = 1.04) on a 10-point scale (t = −9.86, p < .001). Qualitative analysis of project artifacts and student process reflections identified a taxonomy of human in the loop practices integrating AI literacies and self-regulation across the Plan, Iterate, Evaluate cycle. Planning practices involved activating domain knowledge to identify AI applications and establishing evaluative criteria. Iteration practices included developing multi-step workflows, refining prompts through dialogue, and monitoring output quality. Evaluation practices combined assessment of project outcomes with reflection on collaboration processes to inform future use. These practices illustrated adaptive human-AI collaboration strategies that augment rather than replace students’ disciplinary expertise and creative vision. These findings suggest scaffolded experiential learning integrating AI literacies and metacognitive processes can promote effective AI collaboration and empower students to actively direct their own learning.}

In this narrative review, we summarise the current applications of AI in four key areas of obstetric anaesthesiology (perioperative care, neuraxial procedures, labour analgesia and obstetric critical care), where AI has been employed to varying degrees for decision support, event prediction, risk stratification and procedural assistance. We also identify gaps in current practice and propose areas for further research. While promising, AI cannot replace the expertise and clinical judgement of a trained obstetric anaesthesiologist. It should, instead, be viewed as a valuable tool to facilitate and support our practice.}

abstract = {Writing a scientific autobiography is challenging due to the many factors influencing an academic career, including personal experiences, the era of one’s career, research interests, available research tools, institutional environment, societal priorities, and mentorship. Despite changing contexts, certain obligations remain constant: scholars have an obligation to prioritize scientific and personal integrity above the pursuit of individual success, and they must ethically use research tools, including information technology search processes and writing technologies, as part of their scientific processes. The first obligation is built on personal integrity, which in turn characterizes how the second is implemented. My career spanned the last quarter of the 20th century through the first quarter of the 21st century. During this period, there were significant advancements in research methodologies, including the capability of internet search technologies to access scientific databases and desktop writing and referencing software. These advances pale in comparison to the meteoric rise of artificial intelligence large language models (AI LLMs) over the last five years, where information retrieval and writing tools have transformed how we access and use information – potentially placing our personal and authorial integrity at risk. Given this rapid transformation, my autobiography’s objectives are: 1) to share my developmental perspectives on personal and authorial integrity and examine the impact of early experiences where perceived plagiarism helped me define those principles; 2) to review professional guidelines concerning research integrity and policy recommendations for AI LLMs; 3) to discuss changes in my scholarly content resulting from evolving search strategies, writing tools, and journal growth; and 4) by using examples of AI-generated and AI-assisted writing samples, to address the influence of AI LLMs on authorial integrity, including practical risks, opportunities, and current recommended strategies for managing AI LLMs in scholarly writing. By sharing my perspectives, I hope to provide guidance for those pursuing scholarly careers that ensures their authorial integrity.}

Over 100 peptide medications have been introduced to the market to treat a variety of illnesses. Most of these peptide medications are developed on the basis of endogenous peptides or natural peptides, which frequently required expensive, time-consuming, and extensive tests to confirm. As artificial intelligence advances quickly, it is now possible to build machine learning or deep learning models that screen a large number of candidate sequences for therapeutic peptides. Therapeutic peptides, such as those with antibacterial or anticancer properties, have been developed by the application of artificial intelligence algorithms.The process of finding and developing peptide drugs is outlined in this review, along with a few related cases that were helped by AI and conventional methods. These resources will open up new avenues for peptide drug development and discovery, helping to meet the pressing needs of clinical patients for disease treatment. Although peptide drugs are a new class of biopharmaceuticals that distinguish them from chemical and small molecule drugs, their clinical purpose and value cannot be ignored.

Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), including architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and transformers, offers new capabilities to overcome data sparsity, nonlinearity, and uncertainty in renewable-dominant systems. This study aims to comprehensively review the emerging role of Gen-AI in improving solar and wind forecasting, load prediction, energy storage management, and smart grid optimization. Using a comparative and synthesis-based methodology, this review analyses findings from high-impact publications between 2023 and 2025. Results indicate that GAN-based models reduce root mean square error (RMSE) by 15–20 % in solar irradiance forecasting and significantly enhance spatial-temporal wind simulations. Time-series GAN-LSTM hybrids enhance demand forecasting accuracy under nonlinear conditions, while VAE-driven dispatch models achieve gains of 9–12 % in energy efficiency and curtailment reduction. The novelty of this review lies in mapping Gen-AI's integration with digital twins, federated learning, and AI–IoT frameworks, which enables the real-time, privacy-preserving optimisation of complex energy systems. The principal conclusion is that Gen-AI serves as a transformative tool to enhance system resilience, forecasting precision, and operational flexibility in renewable energy networks. For sustainable implementation, future developments must address challenges in model explainability, data privacy, and scalability. These findings support the journal’s scope by highlighting AI-driven advancements for the reliable, efficient, and sustainable transformation of energy systems.}

In this work, we have conducted a systematic mapping study to identify the challenges and solutions associated with the software architecture of quantum-enhanced artificial intelligence systems. The results of the systematic mapping study reveal several architectural patterns that describe how quantum components can be integrated into inference engines, as well as middleware patterns that facilitate communication between classical and quantum components. Each pattern realises a trade-off between various software quality attributes, such as efficiency, scalability, trainability, simplicity, portability, and deployability. The outcomes of this work have been compiled into a catalogue of architectural patterns. Editor’s note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board.}

While recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in applying GAI tools, such as ChatGPT, to support personalized learning, business model simulation, and decision-making, the field remains at an early exploratory stage. Drawing on 50 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2019 and early 2025, the study aims to map the conceptual landscape, identify key themes, and assess the current state of theoretical and empirical development. The findings reveal four major domains in GAI-enabled EE: personalized and adaptive instruction, simulation-based entrepreneurial training, ethical and psychological concerns, and ecosystem integration through intelligent systems. Although promising use cases are identified, most studies are either conceptual or limited to small-scale exploratory evidence. As such, the long-term impact of GAI on entrepreneurial competence, mindset, and outcomes remains uncertain and calls for empirical caution. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a set of research propositions and a conceptual framework that integrates micro-level instructional applications with meso-level competency development and macro-level ecosystem readiness. These are grounded in educational theories, including constructivism, experiential learning, and social cognitive theory. In addition, the review suggests methodological strategies, such as structural equation modeling (SEM), hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), and longitudinal mixed-methods designs, to test GAI's influence across cultural and institutional contexts rigorously. Furthermore, the study discusses actionable implications for educators, policymakers, and researchers, emphasizing the importance of ethical guidance, digital equity, and cross-contextual adaptability. It advocates for designing GAI-integrated curricula that foster not only technical proficiency but also critical thinking, creativity, and ethical reasoning. By systematically synthesizing current findings while avoiding overgeneralized claims, this review contributes to clarifying the conceptual boundaries of GAI in EE and sets the foundation for future empirical exploration.}

A cross-sectional, survey-based method was used to collect data from 410 university students. Structural equation modeling was implied to examine the research framework of the study. The findings confirm that financial services knowledge, familiarity with artificial intelligence, government support, and user innovativeness have a direct positive impact on Fintech adoption among university students. The results also show that perceived ease of use slightly moderates the relationship between government support and user innovativeness. Meanwhile, results from the mediation analysis reveal an indirect effect of these variables on Fintech adoption through user innovativeness. The study's findings recommend practical suggestions to academic institutes and Fintech service providers to equip university students with the necessary financial knowledge and familiarity with artificial intelligence across various disciplines, which can be achieved through sufficient government support. All these can potentially revolutionize Fintech services adoption and boost economic growth, specifically in Asia-Pacific developing countries.

To evaluate the feasibility, usability, and efficacy of innovative generative pretrained transformer chatbot in improving self-care in hypertensive patients in a resource-limited setting.
Patients and Methods
A single-arm nonblinded clinical trial was deployed in a busy cardiology clinic in a low-resource setting. Artificial intelligence–enabled chatbot (Healthy Heart Assistant) was activated in smartphones of 50 adults on treatment for hypertension. Participants were trained on how to use the Healthy Heart Assistant including setting medication and appointment reminders. Baseline questionnaires were administered at enrollment and 30 days later to explore acceptability, feasibility and usability of the bot. We used chatbot usability questionnaire and self-made Healthy Heart Assistant satisfaction questionnaire to assess bot usability and patients’ satisfaction, respectively. The study began on April 5, 2024, through July 15, 2024.
Results
Of 200 hypertensive clinic attendees, 70 (35%) had internet-enabled bot-compatible cell phones, of which 50 hypertensive patients were recruited to participate in the study. Among 50 participants, 2 (4%) were lost to follow-up; 19 (39.6%) were women; and 40 (83.3%) had attained tertiary level of education. Mean time of training to use bot was 5.7 minutes, with 35 (70.8%) of participants being able to use the bot within 5 minutes. The median frequency of chats for participants within the timeframe was an average of 1.5 chats/day. Chatbot usability questionnaire score was 69.5%, whereas self-made Healthy Heart Assistant satisfaction questionnaire score was 90%.
Conclusion
This proof-of-concept study shows that generative artificial intelligence can be applied with reasonable success in hypertension self-care in low-resource settings and has potential for being effective.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and treatment recommendation performance of four artificial intelligence chatbots in fictional pulpal and periradicular disease cases. Additionally, it investigated response consistency and the influence of text order and language on chatbot performance.
Methods
In this cross-sectional comparative study, eleven cases representing various pulpal and periradicular pathologies were created. These cases were presented to four chatbots (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4.0, Bard, and Bing) in both Portuguese and English, with the information order varied (signs and symptoms first or imaging data first). Statistical analyses included the Kruskal-Wallis test, Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner pairwise comparisons, simple logistic regression, and the binomial test.
Results
Bing and ChatGPT 4.0 achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy rates (86.4 % and 85.3 % respectively), significantly outperforming ChatGPT 3.5 (46.5 %) and Bard (28.6 %) (p < 0.001). For treatment recommendations, ChatGPT 4.0, Bing, and ChatGPT 3.5 performed similarly (94.4 %, 93.2 %, and 86.3 %, respectively), while Bard exhibited significantly lower accuracy (75 %, p < 0.001). No significant association between diagnosis and treatment accuracy was found for Bard and Bing, but a positive association was observed for ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4.0 (p < 0.05). The overall consistency rate was 98.29 %, with no significant differences related to text order or language. Cases presented in Portuguese prompted significantly more additional information requests than those in English (33.5 % vs. 10.2 %; p < 0.001), with the relevance of this information being higher in Portuguese (29.5 % vs. 8.5 %; p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Bing and ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy, while Bard showed the lowest accuracy in both diagnosis and treatment recommendations. However, the clinical application of these tools necessitates critical interpretation by dentists, as chatbot responses are not consistently reliable.}

Social networks are dynamic environments where user preferences, sentiment, and relevance are inherently subjective and context-dependent. Fuzzy logic, with its ability to handle imprecise and uncertain information, proves invaluable in capturing the nuances of user interactions. By incorporating linguistic variables and membership functions, fuzzy AI enables the modeling of diverse factors influencing the desirability of content or connections, such as user engagement, sentiment analysis, and relevance to individual preferences. This approach contributes to more personalized and context-aware experiences for social media users, as the system adapts to the dynamic nature of social interactions. Leveraging fuzzy AI in social networks enhances the platform’s capability to recommend content, suggest connections, and tailor the user experience based on a nuanced understanding of relative desirability within the vast and evolving landscape of social interactions. Preference Leveled Evaluation Functions Method can be used in fuzzy Artificial Neural Network systems to evaluate the relative desirability. The goal of this technique is to create a system that can accurately identify most matching connection through Social Network dataset. The technique involves Defining Factors and Preference Levels. This approach can help us to make informed decisions when selecting desired instruction and further course of action based on multiple factors that might have varying degrees of importance. It will identify the factors that are important for evaluating Social Network dataset. These levels could be “Highly Desirable,” “Desirable,” “Neutral,” “Less Desirable,” and “Undesirable.”. We Create membership functions for each factor and each preference level. These functions define the fuzzy boundaries for each preference level. Then we Implement a Fuzzy Inference Engine that uses the fuzzy rules to compute the fuzzy output membership degrees for each preference level. A Defuzzification process then will convert the aggregated fuzzy preference levels back into crisp values for each preference level using a defuzzification method.}

We find that “simple AI” technologies such as key data extraction from documents and optical character recognition are used widely in audits while “complex AI” tools are only being developed. We find RPA is used to automate repetitive administrative processes while the use of RPA for audit tasks is not as common. We also find that the main AI adoption challenges are related to transparency and explainability, AI bias, data privacy, robustness and reliability, fear of auditor overreliance on AI, and the need for AI guidance.

In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly leveraging advanced technological frameworks—most notably the convergence of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)—as critical enablers for transforming their management and planning processes. Within this dynamic landscape, Urban Brain (UB) and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) have emerged as prominent AIoT-powered city platforms. Defined by their complex functionalities and multi-layered architectures, these systems exemplify Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS), offering a cohesive foundation for integrating real-time operational responsiveness with strategic predictive foresight. Despite notable technological progress, a critical gap persists in effectively integrating the distinct yet complementary capabilities of UB and UDT within a structured and scalable framework. To the best of our knowledge, research on the explicit fusion of UB's real-time analytics—enabled through stream processing—with UDT's predictive analytics—driven by simulation modeling—is scant, if not absent. Most existing studies continue to treat UB and UDT as siloed systems, failing to recognize the critical need to synchronize their respective operational and strategic functions. This fragmentation limits the ability of urban systems to respond both adaptively and proactively to the complex, interrelated challenges of environmental sustainability. To address this critical gap, this study introduces a novel foundational framework—Artificial Intelligence of Things for Sustainable Smart City Brain and Digital Twin Systems—designed to synergistically integrate UB and UDT as AIoT-enabled platforms within a unified CPSoS architecture. This framework addresses the critical disconnect between real-time operational management and strategic predictive planning, delivering an integrated pathway for advancing environmentally sustainable smart city development goals. Harnessing the complementary strengths of UB and UDT, it empowers cities to respond dynamically to immediate urban demands while ensuring consistent alignment with long-term sustainability goals. UB's real-time analytics enhance the efficiency of daily urban operations, whereas UDT's predictive modeling anticipates and simulates future scenarios. Together, they establish a synergistic feedback loop: UB's real-time insights continuously inform UDT's strategic simulations, while UDT's long-range forecasts iteratively refine UB's operational decision-making. The framework thus equips researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with a robust methodology for designing and implementing adaptive, efficient, and resilient urban ecosystems. It facilitates the development of intelligent urban environments that can advance environmental sustainability by integrating solid theoretical foundations with actionable strategies.}

Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer death globally. As radiology interlaces with various medical fields, the progress of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in radiology has impacted diverse areas of medicine, including CRC. Utilizing AI such as Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Explainable AI (XAI), and hybrid models in CRC screening leads to a notable decrease in the occurrence and mortality of CRC patients. Incorporation of bioinformatics tools within AI aids in screening and identifying a more significant number of CRC biomarkers.
Methods
Due to this demand, an enormous amount of research has been conducted. Therefore, in this study, we utilized a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to encompass all facets of findings from relevant articles. Inspection of genetic factors inspection, CRC early detection, late-stage CRC rapid prediction, treatment plan selection, metastatic biomarkers discovery, CRC types classification, CRC risk prediction, and CRC survival rate prediction are the critical uses of applications employed in the CRC field.
Results
Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Conventional Neural Network (CNN), and other AI models are frequently used in such scenarios. A comprehensive assessment was conducted on the diverse issues and obstacles associated with implementing AI applications for this particular disease. According to the data, most papers are evaluated mainly on accuracy, delay time, data privacy, robustness, and dataset availability. ML models are employed in 50 % of the papers, while DL models account for 23.3 %. Furthermore, XAI is utilized in 10 % of cases, and hybrid models are implemented in 16.7 % of papers.

abstract = {Given the risks and ethical concerns of integrating generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into education, scholars have argued for a critical-reflective education approach that addresses the long-term implications of GenAI. However, empirical research on GenAI education approaches is scarce. This study investigates the prevalence of protective-preventive, critical-reflective, and creative-productive GenAI education approaches in highly digitized Swiss upper secondary schools and how students' experiences of these approaches relate to two aspects of their digital agency: GenAI confidence and GenAI responsibility. Using data from 2357 students, the results showed that the critical-reflective approach was the most commonly experienced and significantly predicted students’ GenAI confidence and responsibility. The creative-productive approach positively and significantly predicted GenAI confidence but not responsibility, while the protective-preventive approach, although the second most common approach, was not significantly related to either outcome. However, these approaches explained little variance in the dependent variables, suggesting that they may not yet be effectively implemented or that digital agency is primarily developed outside schools. Analysis of the control variables showed that identifying as a female had a negative significant effect on GenAI confidence and a positive significant effect on GenAI responsibility. The findings highlight the importance of adopting a critical-reflective GenAI education approach with attention to gender issues in fostering responsible and confident digital citizens.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) is used increasingly in point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). However, the true role, utility, advantages, and limitations of AI tools in POCUS have been poorly understood.
Aim
to conduct a scoping review on the current literature of AI in POCUS to identify (1) how AI is being applied in POCUS, and (2) how AI in POCUS could be utilized in clinical settings.
Methods
The review followed the JBI scoping review methodology. A search strategy was conducted in Medline, Embase, Emcare, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and AI POCUS manufacturer websites. Selection criteria, evidence screening, and selection were performed in Covidence. Data extraction and analysis were performed on Microsoft Excel by the primary investigator and confirmed by the secondary investigators.
Results
Thirty-three papers were included. AI POCUS on the cardiopulmonary region was the most prominent in the literature. AI was most frequently used to automatically measure biometry using POCUS images. AI POCUS was most used in acute settings. However, novel applications in non-acute and low-resource settings were also explored. AI had the potential to increase POCUS accessibility and usability, expedited care and management, and had a reasonably high diagnostic accuracy in limited applications such as measurement of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction, Inferior Vena Cava Collapsibility Index, Left-Ventricular Outflow Tract Velocity Time Integral and identifying B-lines of the lung. However, AI could not interpret poor images, underperformed compared to standard-of-care diagnostic methods, and was less effective in patients with specific disease states, such as severe illnesses that limit POCUS image acquisition.
Conclusion
This review uncovered the applications of AI in POCUS and the advantages and limitations of AI POCUS in different clinical settings. Future research in the field must first establish the diagnostic accuracy of AI POCUS tools and explore their clinical utility through clinical trials.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown potential in enhancing ECG analysis, but its accuracy in detecting atrial fibrillation (AF) in COVID-19 patients remains unstudied. Given the increased risk of arrhythmias and thromboembolic events in this population, AI could aid in timely correct diagnosis, reduce unnecessary consultations, tests, and minimize infection spread. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of the AI-based PMcardio application in detecting AF in COVID-19 patients.
Methods
The study analyzed 116 hospitalized COVID-19 consecutive patients using paper-based medical records, with a particular focus on ECGs. The presence and type of arrhythmias were determined by an experienced cardiologist and compared with assessments by the infectious disease specialists collected from patient medical records and the PMcardio application.
Results
The mean patient age was 63.28 (14.980) years. The PMcardio AI application demonstrated perfect diagnostic performance, achieving a sensitivity and specificity of 1.00 for AF detection compared to cardiologist's evaluations. Infectious disease specialists showed lower sensitivity (0.85) but retained high specificity (0.97). No significant association was found between the AI confidence score and diagnostic accuracy (p = 0.660), indicating consistent performance across confidence levels. Additionally, the AI's severity classification correlated significantly with rhythm diagnoses (p < 0.001).
Conclusions
AI-powered ECG analysis using PMcardio highly accurately detected AF in COVID-19 patients, outperforming infectious disease specialists and matching cardiologist's accuracy. The integration of AI in clinical practice may enhance arrhythmia detection and streamline diagnostic workflows, particularly in resource-limited and infectious disease settings.}

abstract = {Background
With the rapid development and increasing complexity of the modern food industry and food supply chain, consumers are placing ever-higher demands on food quality and safety. This trend is driving food companies to adopt rapid, efficient, and comprehensive monitoring systems, highlighting the urgent need for fast and reliable detection methods. While non-invasive testing (NIT) techniques offer efficient and non-invasive assessment, the demand for intelligent data interpretation and automated decision-making is growing. Artificial intelligence (AI) provides powerful tools for extracting meaningful patterns, enabling intelligent, accurate, and scalable food quality monitoring. The integration of AI with NIT represents a critical advancement, not only enhancing detection accuracy such as calibration error reduction by 10–20 % but also improving detection efficiency such as rapid screening within minutes for food quality and safety assessment.
Scope and approach
Improving the reliability of detection results and expanding the scale of rapid detection can effectively enhance the application value of NIT techniques in food production and distribution. Therefore, the current review aims to systematically explore how AI can assist NIT in food quality and safety applications, with a specific focus on two fundamental dimensions: accuracy and efficiency. Covering a wide range of NIT techniques and food detection targets, the current review is structured around two core perspectives: (1) enhancing accuracy through factor calibration, data enhancement, feature extraction and model optimization; and (2) improving efficiency through automation and robotics, portable device, high-throughput mode and IoT and blockchain. By summarizing key methods and advances from these two perspectives, this review provides a comprehensive framework and technical reference to guide future research and practical applications in intelligent food quality and safety assessment.
Key findings and conclusions
In summary, the integration of AI with NIT significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in food quality and safety assessment. Current challenges mainly involve limited interpretability, insufficient data diversity, and delays in industrial deployment. In the short term, progress is expected in interpretable and transferable AI models, multi-source sensor data fusion, and edge AI for real-time monitoring. In the longer term, disruptive technologies such as neural architecture search, neuromorphic computing, and quantum machine learning hold promise for transformative advances. By distinguishing feasible short-term developments from disruptive long-term opportunities, this review provides a roadmap to bridge scientific innovation and practical industrial application in AI-powered food NIT.}

Nonetheless, applying it in the clinic has been slow because of issues with the spectrum's complexity, background noise, and differences in biological samples. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into SERS has made its use for diagnostics much better by allowing automation of spectral preprocessing, noise removal, key information extraction, and accurate classification. Traditional machine learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) AI algorithms can effectively interpret complex SERS data and recognize the biomarkers specific to different diseases in non-invasive samples such as serum, saliva, urine, breath condensates, and exosomes. AI-SERS technology provides a quick, scalable way to find cancer at an early stage, classify the type of cancer, and track the effects of therapy, matching the goals of precision oncology. It clearly explains the fundamentals of SERS, AI-based techniques to signal analysis and how the two are employed together in oncology. We describe new progress toward diagnosing many cancers, assessing outcomes, and tracking how patients react to therapy. In particular, the review presents the use of AI-enhanced SERS platforms for cancers of different types, such as breast cancer (BC), lung cancer (LC), prostate cancer (PCa), skin cancer, oral cancer, gastrointestinal cancers, colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PaC), and ovarian cancer (OvCa). We also discuss how these platforms are being used for early diagnosis, monitoring treatment effects, and predicting the possibility of the disease returning. Ultimately, we discuss how key translational challenges like data standardization, the ability to explain models, and the need for approval by authorities must be dealt with before AI-SERS can be used routinely in clinical oncology.}

Drawing on a qualitative study of 22 professionals from CMAs and their clients, we develop a framework showing how generative AI enables widespread content marketing capabilities, alters content marketing market structures, and forces CMAs to redefine their value propositions. Our findings reveal a shift from execution-based services to expertise-driven roles, including creative consulting, hyper-personalization, and AI-enabled service innovation. We contribute theoretically by extending the concept of technology-enabled democratization, offering a structured framework that links capability redistribution, market restructuring, and incumbent response strategies. Practically, we propose a playbook to help CMAs adapt to this transformation through (1) strategic repositioning, (2) operational integration, (3) ethics, regulation, and compliance, (4) and market and client engagement.

The findings suggest that perceived risk does not always reduce AI's acceptability or trust towards AI. Despite being highly risky, traffic control AI had the highest levels of trust and acceptance, indicating that the perceived benefit of AI usage can outweigh risk concerns. Ethicality and trust consistently emerged as significant predictors of AI acceptance across all the proposed scenarios. Furthermore, the need for regulatory oversight was more pronounced in riskier scenarios. The study reveals significant differences across scenarios, emphasizing that AI acceptance is highly context dependent. The findings suggest that AI regulation and deployment strategies should be tailored to specific contexts to enhance public acceptance.}
