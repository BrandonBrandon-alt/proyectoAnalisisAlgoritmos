abstract = {Global economic growth has entered into the recovery phase of the economic cycle that is resilient yet slow, while the main culprit lies in the lower growth of green total factor productivity (TFP) caused by climate change intensification. It is imperative to formulate unconventional productivity models that can simultaneously solve ecological concerns and the crucial challenges posed by low innovation-driven productivity. This research aims to explore how and whether artificial intelligence (AI) as a critical dynamic capability to strengthen the development of firms' new quality productive forces (NQPFs). Based on the sample of Chinese manufacturing listed companies from 2011 to 2022, our findings show that AI promotes the development of firms' NQPFs; green innovation mediates the AI–NQPFs relationship, while economic policy uncertainty (EPU) moderates the above-mentioned mediating mechanism. Theoretically, our research extends Marx's view of productive forces to create a new construct of advanced productivity in China. Considering AI as a critical dynamic capability, we also provide insights into how productive forces are formed by human intelligence and AI. Practically, our findings help policymakers and practitioners reduce the impact of EPU caused partly by climate changes through AI usage and thereby predict the next trend of sustainable development.}

abstract = {Background
The peer review process faces challenges of reviewer fatigue and bias. Artificial intelligence (AI) may help address these issues, but its application in the oral and maxillofacial surgery peer review process remains unexplored.
Purpose
The purpose of the study was to measure and compare manuscript review performance among 4 large language models and human reviewers. large language models are AI systems trained on vast text datasets that can generate human-like responses.
Study Design/Setting/Sample
In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated original research articles submitted to the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery between January and December 2023. Manuscripts were randomly selected from all submissions that received at least one external peer review.
Predictor Variable
The predictor variable was source of review: human reviewers or AI models. We tested 4 AI models: Generative Pretrained Transformer-4o and Generative Pretrained Transformer-o1 (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA), Claude (version 3.5; Anthropic, San Francisco, CA), and Gemini (version 1.5; Google, Mountain View, CA). These models will be referred to by their architectural design characteristics, ie, dense transformers, sparse-expert, multimodal, and base transformer, to highlight their technical differences rather than their commercial identities.
Outcome Variables
Primary outcomes included reviewer recommendations (accept = 3 to reject = 0) and responses to 6 Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery editor questions. Secondary outcomes comprised temporal stability (consistency of AI evaluations over time) analysis, domain-specific assessments (methodology, statistical analysis, clinical relevance, originality, and presentation clarity; 1 to 5 scale), and model clustering patterns.
Analyses
Agreement between AI and human recommendations was assessed using weighted Cohen's kappa. Intermodel reliability and temporal stability (24-hour interval) were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients. Domain scoring patterns were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance with post hoc comparisons and hierarchical clustering.
Results
From 22 manuscripts, human reviewers rejected 15 (68.2%), while AI rejection rates were statistically significantly lower (0 to 9.1%, P < .001). AI models demonstrated high consistency in their evaluations over time (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.88, P < .001) and showed moderate agreement with human decisions (κ = 0.38 to 0.46).
Conclusions
While AI models showed reliable internal consistency, they were less likely to recommend rejection than human reviewers. This suggests their optimal use is as screening tools complementing expert human review rather than as replacements.}

Food-derived bioactive peptides (FBPs) play a vital role in nutrition and health. Traditional experimental approaches for identifying FBPs are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. In contrast, computational approaches, for example, virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations, have their own limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology enables high-throughput screening and analysis of activity mechanisms for FBPs. Ongoing AI research will enhance the in-depth development and application of FBPs.
Scope and approach
This review outlines the general process of AI screening for FBPs, including data foundation, molecular feature representation, machine learning and deep learning model construction and training, as well as evaluation and validation. It also summarizes recent research advances in AI screening of FBPs with different bioactivities, discusses current key issues and challenges, and highlights future research directions and trends of FBPs.
Key findings and conclusions
Significant advancements have been made in utilizing AI screening methods to identify functional FBPs with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, flavor-enhancing, and hypotensive properties, while the research on anti-obesity and anti-fatigue peptides is still at a nascent stage. Deep learning has demonstrated clear predictive advantages over traditional machine learning techniques. However, challenges remain when screening for peptides with different biological activities. Moving forward, data augmentation strategies should be developed within food-specific large models, and a universal deep learning framework based on multi-scale chemical space features should be created to predict peptide-target dynamic interactions. A high-throughput screening framework should be established, alongside enhanced research on AI methods for multifunctional properties like anti-obesity and anti-fatigue effects.}

Artificial Intelligence tools are being introduced in almost every field of human life, including medical sciences and medical education, among scepticism and enthusiasm.
Research question
to assess how a generative language tool (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3.5, ChatGPT) performs at both generating questions and answering a neurosurgical residents’ written exam. Namely, to assess how ChatGPT generates questions, how it answers human-generated questions, how residents answer AI-generated questions and how AI answers its self-generated question.
Materials and methods
50 questions were included in the written exam, 46 questions were generated by humans (senior staff members) and 4 were generated by ChatGPT. 11 participants took the exam (ChatGPT and 10 residents). Questions were both open-ended and multiple-choice. 8 questions were not submitted to ChatGPT since they contained images or schematic drawings to interpret.
Results
formulating requests to ChatGPT required an iterative process to precise both questions and answers. Chat GPT scored among the lowest ranks (9/11) among all the participants). There was no difference in response rate for residents’ between human-generated vs AI-generated questions that could have been attributed to less clarity of the question. ChatGPT answered correctly to all its self-generated questions.
Discussion and conclusions
AI is a promising and powerful tool for medical education and for specific medical purposes, which need to be further determined. To request AI to generate logical and sound questions, that request must be formulated as precise as possible, framing the content, the type of question and its correct answers.}

abstract = {Research Question
How reliable are generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots in responding to patient-relevant questions about preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), as evaluated by reproductive medicine specialists?
Design
A prospective evaluation was conducted comparing three publicly available generative AI models—ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini-1.5, and Llama-2. Twelve reproductive medicine specialists from different clinics assessed chatbot-generated responses to 13 PGT-related questions, divided into simple and controversial categories. Each response was scored from 0 to 5 using predefined criteria. Assuming all answers were excellent, the maximum score was 25 points for simple questions and 40 points for controversial ones.
Results
A total of 156 evaluations were completed. Among simple questions, the lowest-rated response was to “What are the types and techniques used for PGT?” (mean score: 2.83±0.94). For controversial questions, “What is the percentage of aneuploidy that allows an embryo to be defined as mosaic?” scored lowest (2.67±1.22). ChatGPT performed best across both categories (simple: 16.83±1.80; controversial: 27.75±4.49), followed by Gemini (14.92±2.02; 26.08±3.99) and Llama (13.58±3.60; 16.92±4.96). Statistically significant differences were observed, particularly between ChatGPT and Llama (p=0.027 for simple, p<0.001 for controversial), and between Gemini and Llama for controversial questions (p<0.001). No significant performance differences were noted across participating specialists.
Conclusions
Generative AI shows moderate reliability in addressing PGT-related inquiries, with ChatGPT and Gemini outperforming Llama. While performance was higher for simple than for controversial questions, the variability underscores the need for clinical oversight. Further refinement and validation are essential before widespread integration of AI tools in reproductive medicine.}

The data gathered from the pre-test and post-test were analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), which indicated that there were notable differences in the post-test scores between the two groups concerning positive motivation, PsyCap, and PWB. Particularly, the integration of AI tools was found to markedly improve students' motivation, PWB, and PsyCap. These results suggest that AI tools not only boost language acquisition but also contribute meaningfully to learners' motivation and PsyCap. Implications include the need for educators and policymakers to consider AI integration not just for academic outcomes, but for cultivating emotionally supported learning environments in EFL contexts.}

For the microcosm of colorectal surgery, AI can assist in specimen acquisition, pathologic and radiologic diagnosis, selection of treatment modality, pre/postoperative risk stratification, and more globally in surgeon education, grantsmanship, and claims assessment. However, with such power comes the risk of its abuse, and subsequent harm to patients (and providers). Understanding a brief history of AI and the hierarchy of the predominant forms with which we interact, allow us to better understand the nature of these risks and how we can apply ethical frameworks to better understand and mitigate/prevent them.

With the growing severity of global climate change, achieving carbon neutrality has become a central focus worldwide. The intersection of population studies and carbon neutrality introduces significant challenges in predicting and optimizing energy consumption, as demographic factors play a crucial role in shaping carbon emissions. This paper proposes a model based on a Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), enhanced with a dual-stage attention mechanism for optimization. The model automatically extracts key features from complex demographic and carbon emission data, leveraging the attention mechanism to assign appropriate weights, thereby capturing the behavioral patterns and trends in energy consumption driven by population dynamics more effectively. By integrating multi-source data, including historical carbon emissions, population density, demographic trends, meteorological data, and economic indicators, experimental results demonstrate the model's outstanding performance across multiple datasets.}

abstract = {Design for manufacturing is essential to fully exploit the potential of emerging materials and processing technologies. However, traditional trial-and-error optimisation often exhibits inferior performance in manufacturability-driven problems, particularly when handling complex shapes. Surrogate modelling and optimisation have been widely investigated for efficiently predicting simulation results and enhancing manufacturability. Nevertheless, existing methods are mostly constrained by fixed shape parameterisation schemes, limiting their flexibility and effectiveness. To overcome this limitation, this research develops a non-parametric optimisation framework, validated on a sheet metal forming case study, specifically the blank shape optimisation of an automotive hot-stamped B-pillar. The framework integrates an auto-decoder, serving as a differentiable blank shape generator, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-powered surrogate model for manufacturability evaluation, and an Adam optimiser for automated shape optimisation. The surrogate model predicts thickness distributions from the signed distance fields (SDFs) of blank shapes, which are generated by the auto-decoder from latent vectors; based on the predictions, the optimiser iteratively updates the latent vectors to acquire a blank shape with optimised manufacturability. The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance in terms of the accuracy of thickness distribution prediction, the fidelity of blank shape generation, and the efficiency of blank shape optimisation.}

In addition to mapping the academic discourse, the review also highlights selected practical implementations from existing literature to illustrate how these technologies are being translated into applied workflows. Furthermore, the methodology section critically reflects on the limitations of the keyword-based search strategy and suggests future directions to mitigate potential literature gaps. While many studies demonstrate efficiency gains in early design phases, the integration of these technologies across the full building lifecycle remains limited. Key challenges include insufficient interoperability between platforms, lack of standardisation, and minimal adoption of GD-BIM combinations in construction and logistics. Furthermore, few studies address the regulatory compliance and real-world scalability of AI-assisted generative models.

Grounded in Porter’s Five Forces framework—specifically the threat of substitutes—this commentary explores whether AI can adequately fulfill the complex and relational functions of pharmacists in delivering patient care. Drawing from foundational definitions of pharmaceutical care and economic theories of substitution, the paper examines both historical and emerging competitors to pharmacist-provided services, including physicians, nurses, and now AI-powered tools. Rather than assert a binary conclusion about AI’s ability to replace pharmacists, this paper identifies conditions under which substitution may be more or less likely. Key factors include the nature of the pharmaceutical care service, patient preferences, the quality and accessibility of AI tools, and regulatory and institutional constraints. Using examples from practice and education, the commentary highlights areas where AI may function as a substitute—such as information delivery or curricular mapping—and others where human oversight remains essential. Ultimately, the question is not whether AI will serve as a substitute, but to what extent, under what circumstances, and with what implications for pharmacy educators. Preparing students for a professional environment augmented by AI requires a shift in educational strategies, with a focus on adaptability, data literacy, and meaningful integration of emerging technologies.}

abstract = {The efficacy of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–targeting antibody-drug conjugates has underscored the critical need for precise HER2 diagnostics in breast cancer treatment. Despite the clinical importance, variability in immunohistochemical (IHC) staining protocols and interobserver inconsistencies challenge the reliability of HER2 status assessment, which is critical for guiding patient treatment strategies. To investigate the factors affecting HER2 interpretation consistency, tissue microarrays from 1063 breast carcinoma cases underwent 3 distinct IHC protocols, and a novel artificial intelligence (AI) model was developed to standardize HER2-stained images. A total of 5 sets of tissue microarrays (Nordi QC, protocol 1, protocol 2, protocol 1 AI, and protocol 2 AI) were independently reviewed by 8 pathologists. The Fleiss Kappa value and overall agreement rate measured interobserver agreement, with logistic regression analyzing the impact of variables on diagnostic accuracy. Our results showed that the Nordi QC protocol had the highest interobserver agreement (Kappa 0.754). AI-based image normalization notably enhanced consistency, particularly for HER2 low cases, aligning scores toward the Nordi QC standard. Logistic regression analysis indicated that both staining protocol and AI-based image standardization significantly influenced diagnostic accuracy (P < .001). The American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists 2018 binary criteria demonstrated the highest HER2 interobserver consistency (Kappa > 0.95). Compared with the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists 2023 criteria, the newly proposed null, ultra-low/low, positive criteria, merging HER2 low and ultra-low categories, demonstrated improved reliability and agreement, especially in distinguishing the challenging HER2–ultra-low cases, which showed an exceedingly low interobserver agreement (Kappa < 0.20) across all protocols. Overall, variability in IHC staining protocols and HER2 classification criteria significantly affect the diagnostic consistency among pathologists. The integration of an AI model for image standardization and the adoption of the null, ultra-low/low, positive criteria may refine diagnostic precision and bolster clinical decision-making in breast cancer treatment.}

Designers need to iterate through different design solutions and conduct structural analysis until the design meets the codes and standards. This study proposes and investigates a generative machine learning (ML) framework for inverse design of continuous beam systems. Three generative ML models, including conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), conditional autoencoder with maximum likelihood estimation (CAE-MLE), and denoising diffusion models (DDMs) are trained and fine-tuned on the CBeamXP (Continuous Beam Cross-section Predictors) dataset with 1,000,000 beam sections to generate the cross sectional properties. Research results show that CAE-MLE achieves the highest generation accuracy and robustness, while CVAE offers more variability through latent space sampling. DDMs provide controllable generation variability via a stochasticity parameter in the inverse diffusion process. The proposed framework enables efficient generation of multiple design solutions and can potentially accelerate the conceptual design workflows in structural engineering. This work also demonstrated the feasibility toward artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted structural design using generative approaches and tabular datasets.}

abstract = {Vaccines have long been crucial in safeguarding public health by preventing and controlling infectious diseases. However, traditional vaccine development methods face challenges in efficiency, cost, and response time to emerging pathogens. Recent progress in art AI and nanotechnology is revolutionizing this landscape, offering innovative solutions for vaccine design, delivery, and optimization. This manuscript examines the transformative impact of AI and nanotechnology on advancing vaccine development, highlighting their synergistic effect in overcoming traditional limitations. AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, facilitates rapid identification of immunogenic antigens and epitopes by analyzing vast genomic, proteomic, and immunological datasets. These computational tools optimize vaccine design by predicting antigen stability, immunogenicity, and efficacy, as exemplified by the expedited development of COVID-19 vaccines. Nanotechnology complements these advancements by providing engineered nanoparticles (NPs), including liposomes, polymeric NPs, and biomimetic systems, that enhance antigen delivery, stability, and immune activation. Innovations such as virus-like particles (VLPs) and immune-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs) further enhance vaccine safety and efficacy by mimicking natural infection processes to trigger robust, targeted immune responses. Integrating AI and nanotechnology presents remarkable opportunities for developing personalized immunization strategies. AI algorithms can assess individual immune profiles to design customized vaccines, while nanotechnology enables precise delivery and controlled release of antigens. This interdisciplinary approach accelerates vaccine development, ensuring both safety and efficacy, and lays the foundation for universal vaccines and cancer vaccines that target complex pathogens and non-infectious diseases. Together, AI and nanotechnology herald a new era in vaccinology, enabling the development of vaccines that are faster, more precise, and highly adaptable to emerging and complex health challenges.}

The study utilized a two-stage approach: the first involved artificial intelligence-assisted design tasks and focus group discussions with 24 participants, capturing both visual and textual data. K-means color clustering and thematic analysis were applied to images and texts. The second stage involved surveying 222 individuals and conducting a chi-square test to analyze the frequency of different color dimensions used by the two groups. The results demonstrate that differences in color perception influenced design decision-making outcomes. There was widespread acknowledgment across all groups of the efficiency and inspirational potential of artificial intelligence platforms. However, variations in design education resulted in differing opinions on the replaceability of designers. Future trajectories for artificial intelligence platforms are likely to focus on specialization while addressing challenges such as echo chamber effects, copyright disputes, and the prevention of private information leakage.}

Focusing on the supply chain, this paper constructs a dataset with “focal firm - associated firm - year” observations, to examine the external spillover effects of AI on supply chain decarbonisation. Our findings reveal that AI employed by focal enterprises significantly contribute to curbing carbon emissions among associated enterprises within the supply chain, primarily through green technological innovation (GTI). The role of substantive GTI is predominant, whereas symbolic GTI appears to have an insignificant impact. Meanwhile, from the perspective of synergy, the vertical interaction effect of the supply chain and the horizontal peer effect of industry can strengthen the supply chain decarbonisation effect of AI technology. This paper provides a new synergetic insight for fully releasing the decarbonisation potential of AI based on supply chain interaction, providing empirical evidence and policy references to promote industrial green inclusive development and realize the global zero-carbon goal.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly prominent tool in the field of neurosurgery, revolutionizing various aspects of patient care and surgical practices. AI-powered systems can provide real-time feedback to surgeons, enhancing precision and reducing the risk of complications during surgical procedures. The objective of this study is to review the role of AI in training neurosurgical residents, improving accuracy during surgery, and reducing complications.
Methods
The literature search method involved searching PubMed using relevant keywords to identify English literature publications, including full texts, and concerning human subject matter from its inception until May 2024, initially generating 247,747 results. Articles were then screened for topic relevancy by abstract contents. Further articles were retrieved from the sources cited by the initially reviewed articles. A comprehensive review was then performed on various studies, including observational studies, case-control studies, cohort studies, clinical trials, meta-analyses, and reviews by 4 reviewers individually and then collectively.
Results
Studies on AI in neurosurgery reach more than 4000 produced over a decade alone. The majority of studies regarding clinical diagnosis, risk prediction, and intraoperative guidance remain retrospective in nature. In its current form, AI-based paradigm performed inferiorly to neurosurgery residents in test taking.
Conclusions
AI has potential for broad applications in neurosurgery from use as a diagnostic, predictive, intraoperative, or educational tool. Further research is warranted for prospective use of AI-based technology for delivery of neurosurgical care.}

Methods
An online survey was developed by the Innovation Committee of the E-AHPBA to investigate the current perspectives on the ethical principles and trustworthiness of AI in HPB Surgery among E-AHPBA membership. The survey consisted of 22 questions, based on guidelines outlined by the Artificial Intelligence Surgery Journal Task Force on AI Ethics in clinical surgery and was disseminated via email to all E-AHPBA members.
Results
A total of 84 members of the E-AHPBA participated in the survey. Seventeen out of 22 questions achieved more than 80 % agreement, with nine of those exceeding 90 %. Five questions had agreement levels between 70 % and 80 %.
Conclusion
While HPB surgeons are aware of the need to regulate the use of AI devices, robots, and to protect patient data, consensus appears to be heterogeneous regarding AI's role in mitigating gender-related and minority biases, as well as ensuring fairness and equity.}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force. Research from 2021–2024 demonstrates a maturation characterized by the transition from experimental proofs-of-concept to field-validated applications exhibiting robust performance, including high accuracy (often exceeding 90% in detection tasks) and measurable resource efficiency gains in precision management, robotics, and predictive analytics. However, the translation of this technical promise into equitable, scalable, and sustainable agricultural systems is increasingly bottlenecked by critical socio-technical and ethical challenges. This review synthesizes key technological advancements from the past four years and argues that the next frontier of innovation requires a pivot from a purely techno-optimist focus on algorithmic performance to a socio-technical one. We analyze how emerging paradigms, namely Agricultural Digital Twins and Human-AI Collaboration, represent this shift toward integrated, human-centric systems. Critically, the success of these paradigms and the responsible deployment of AI in agriculture hinge on proactively addressing systemic issues of algorithmic bias, data sovereignty, and the socio-economic impacts on the agricultural workforce. By synthesizing these technical, ethical, and policy dimensions, we propose a strategic roadmap for research, development, and governance to guide the next phase of innovation, ensuring that AI fosters a more productive, resilient, and just food future.}

Over 100 peptide medications have been introduced to the market to treat a variety of illnesses. Most of these peptide medications are developed on the basis of endogenous peptides or natural peptides, which frequently required expensive, time-consuming, and extensive tests to confirm. As artificial intelligence advances quickly, it is now possible to build machine learning or deep learning models that screen a large number of candidate sequences for therapeutic peptides. Therapeutic peptides, such as those with antibacterial or anticancer properties, have been developed by the application of artificial intelligence algorithms.The process of finding and developing peptide drugs is outlined in this review, along with a few related cases that were helped by AI and conventional methods. These resources will open up new avenues for peptide drug development and discovery, helping to meet the pressing needs of clinical patients for disease treatment. Although peptide drugs are a new class of biopharmaceuticals that distinguish them from chemical and small molecule drugs, their clinical purpose and value cannot be ignored. However, the traditional peptide drug research and development has a long development cycle and high investment, and the creation of peptide medications will be substantially hastened by the AI-assisted (AI+) mode, offering a new boost for combating diseases.}

abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are an online source of information consulted by adolescents to gain insight into mental health and wellness behaviors. However, the accuracy and content of generative AI responses to questions related to suicide have not been systematically investigated.
Objective
This study aims to investigate general (not counseling-specific) generative AI chatbots’ responses to questions regarding suicide.
Methods
A content analysis was conducted of the responses of generative AI chatbots to questions about suicide. In phase 1 of the study, generative chatbots examined include: (1) Google Bard or Gemini; (2) Microsoft Bing or CoPilot; (3) ChatGPT 3.5 (OpenAI); and (4) Claude (Anthropic). In phase 2 of the study, additional generative chatbot responses were analyzed, which included Google Gemini, Claude 2 (Anthropic), xAI Grok 2, Mistral AI, and Meta AI (Meta Platforms). The two phases occurred a year apart.
Results
Findings included a linguistic analysis of the authenticity and tone within the responses using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program. There was an increase in the depth and accuracy of the responses between phase 1 and phase 2 of the study. There is evidence that the responses by the generative AI chatbots were more comprehensive and responsive during phase 2 than phase 1. Specifically, the responses were found to provide more information regarding all aspects of suicide (eg, signs of suicide, lethality, resources, and ways to support those in crisis). Another difference noted in the responses between the first and second phases was the emphasis on the 988 suicide hotline number.
Conclusions
While this dynamic information may be helpful for youth in need, the importance of individuals seeking help from a trained mental health professional remains. Further, generative AI algorithms related to suicide questions should be checked periodically to ensure best practices regarding suicide prevention are being communicated.}

While recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in applying GAI tools, such as ChatGPT, to support personalized learning, business model simulation, and decision-making, the field remains at an early exploratory stage. Drawing on 50 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2019 and early 2025, the study aims to map the conceptual landscape, identify key themes, and assess the current state of theoretical and empirical development. The findings reveal four major domains in GAI-enabled EE: personalized and adaptive instruction, simulation-based entrepreneurial training, ethical and psychological concerns, and ecosystem integration through intelligent systems. Although promising use cases are identified, most studies are either conceptual or limited to small-scale exploratory evidence. As such, the long-term impact of GAI on entrepreneurial competence, mindset, and outcomes remains uncertain and calls for empirical caution. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a set of research propositions and a conceptual framework that integrates micro-level instructional applications with meso-level competency development and macro-level ecosystem readiness. These are grounded in educational theories, including constructivism, experiential learning, and social cognitive theory. In addition, the review suggests methodological strategies, such as structural equation modeling (SEM), hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), and longitudinal mixed-methods designs, to test GAI's influence across cultural and institutional contexts rigorously. Furthermore, the study discusses actionable implications for educators, policymakers, and researchers, emphasizing the importance of ethical guidance, digital equity, and cross-contextual adaptability. It advocates for designing GAI-integrated curricula that foster not only technical proficiency but also critical thinking, creativity, and ethical reasoning. By systematically synthesizing current findings while avoiding overgeneralized claims, this review contributes to clarifying the conceptual boundaries of GAI in EE and sets the foundation for future empirical exploration.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) applications require human experience and insight based on the understanding of complex environments and uncertainties and model predictive performance. However, existing research has focused on applying big data and developing automated processes. Actual user understanding and the consideration of model usability are insufficient. Studies must consider the human–machine cooperation-based approach in developing the AI model. This study proposes a collaborative approach through which the explainable AI (XAI) model, a self-explaining deep neural network for text classification, communicates with users. The proposed XAI model provides users with an explanation for the model prediction along with the prediction results for patent evaluation. Users provide feedback based on the model predictions and their explanations. The source XAI model is refined via relearning by reflecting on user feedback. This study experiments to assess model improvement using the human collaboration method. As for the human collaborative method, this study considers the process of human intervention independent of the XAI model's results as well as the method of human participation based on the explanation presented by the XAI model. The experimental results verified the XAI model performance, showing the highest accuracy (0.890) and F1 score (0.916), such that the model can be applied efficiently to patent evaluation. The XAI–human collaboration model presented in this study can also be expanded and applied to technology intelligence tasks. However, the collaborative approach in this study has complete trust in human advice from technical experts; thus, subsequent collaborative XAI models could be improved by communicating bidirectionally with human resources as a complementary relationship.}

The execution device (GPU microcontroller) responsible for the current BESS control is a deep learning convolutional machine, while a statistical shallow learning regression machine (mdl) is responsible for controlling the MV/LV transformer ratio settings. The research was carried out in a real LV grid with high-RES saturation. The model was implemented in the environment: Power Word Simulator, MATLAB and SIMULINK.}

abstract = {Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) enable vehicle-infrastructure communication, enhancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Vehicles interconnect wirelessly to share information. Still, this communication is vulnerable to various attacks, particularly in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) scenarios. This study proposes an Artificial Intelligence-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in an edge-envisioned environment, combining edge computing and deep learning. The approach uses the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for edge node selection to perform packet forwarding and employs a Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) for intrusion detection. This poses a challenge since regular traffic samples are typically more prevalent than anomalous traffic, and the dataset is unstructured and highly imbalanced. Our BiGAN-based model overcomes synchronization challenges between generator and discriminator networks. Training iterations increase independently until cross-entropy loss conditions are met. The trained encoder-discriminator network is a single-class classifier, distinguishing normal and abnormal data. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance on the NSL-KDD dataset compared to similar methods.}

Social networks are dynamic environments where user preferences, sentiment, and relevance are inherently subjective and context-dependent. Fuzzy logic, with its ability to handle imprecise and uncertain information, proves invaluable in capturing the nuances of user interactions. By incorporating linguistic variables and membership functions, fuzzy AI enables the modeling of diverse factors influencing the desirability of content or connections, such as user engagement, sentiment analysis, and relevance to individual preferences. This approach contributes to more personalized and context-aware experiences for social media users, as the system adapts to the dynamic nature of social interactions. Leveraging fuzzy AI in social networks enhances the platform’s capability to recommend content, suggest connections, and tailor the user experience based on a nuanced understanding of relative desirability within the vast and evolving landscape of social interactions. Preference Leveled Evaluation Functions Method can be used in fuzzy Artificial Neural Network systems to evaluate the relative desirability. The goal of this technique is to create a system that can accurately identify most matching connection through Social Network dataset. The technique involves Defining Factors and Preference Levels. This approach can help us to make informed decisions when selecting desired instruction and further course of action based on multiple factors that might have varying degrees of importance. It will identify the factors that are important for evaluating Social Network dataset. These levels could be “Highly Desirable,” “Desirable,” “Neutral,” “Less Desirable,” and “Undesirable.”. We Create membership functions for each factor and each preference level. These functions define the fuzzy boundaries for each preference level. Then we Implement a Fuzzy Inference Engine that uses the fuzzy rules to compute the fuzzy output membership degrees for each preference level. A Defuzzification process then will convert the aggregated fuzzy preference levels back into crisp values for each preference level using a defuzzification method.}

We find that “simple AI” technologies such as key data extraction from documents and optical character recognition are used widely in audits while “complex AI” tools are only being developed. We find RPA is used to automate repetitive administrative processes while the use of RPA for audit tasks is not as common.

Our analysis of 84 studies from 2018 to 2024 provides the first thorough cross-disorder comparison of AI implementation patterns. According to our data, each condition has different success rates and technological preferences. AI applications are expanding quickly, especially in research on ASD (56 % of studies), followed by ADHD (36 %), and DYS (8 %). In almost half of the reviewed studies, computer-assisted technologies, which have demonstrated encouraging results in terms of treatment support and diagnostic accuracy, became the main mode of intervention. Despite high accuracy in controlled settings, the implementation of these technologies in clinical practice faces significant challenges. While human oversight remains essential in clinical applications, future advancements should prioritize privacy protection and the ability to assess tools longitudinally. Notably, multimodal approaches that integrate various data types have improved diagnostic accuracy; recent research has shown that they can detect ASD with up to 99.8 % accuracy and ADHD with up to 97.4 % accuracy. A promising trend is the combination of mobile applications and wearable technology, especially for real-time monitoring and intervention. This review highlights the potential and current limitations of AI-driven tools in supporting children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Future development should focus not on replacing clinical expertise, but on augmenting it. Research efforts should aim at creating tools that enhance professional judgment while preserving the essential human components of assessment and intervention.}

abstract = {Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the urgent need for innovative paradigms in urban development. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly leveraging advanced technological frameworks—most notably the convergence of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)—as critical enablers for transforming their management and planning processes. Within this dynamic landscape, Urban Brain (UB) and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) have emerged as prominent AIoT-powered city platforms. Defined by their complex functionalities and multi-layered architectures, these systems exemplify Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS), offering a cohesive foundation for integrating real-time operational responsiveness with strategic predictive foresight. Despite notable technological progress, a critical gap persists in effectively integrating the distinct yet complementary capabilities of UB and UDT within a structured and scalable framework. To the best of our knowledge, research on the explicit fusion of UB's real-time analytics—enabled through stream processing—with UDT's predictive analytics—driven by simulation modeling—is scant, if not absent. Most existing studies continue to treat UB and UDT as siloed systems, failing to recognize the critical need to synchronize their respective operational and strategic functions. This fragmentation limits the ability of urban systems to respond both adaptively and proactively to the complex, interrelated challenges of environmental sustainability. To address this critical gap, this study introduces a novel foundational framework—Artificial Intelligence of Things for Sustainable Smart City Brain and Digital Twin Systems—designed to synergistically integrate UB and UDT as AIoT-enabled platforms within a unified CPSoS architecture. This framework addresses the critical disconnect between real-time operational management and strategic predictive planning, delivering an integrated pathway for advancing environmentally sustainable smart city development goals. Harnessing the complementary strengths of UB and UDT, it empowers cities to respond dynamically to immediate urban demands while ensuring consistent alignment with long-term sustainability goals. UB's real-time analytics enhance the efficiency of daily urban operations, whereas UDT's predictive modeling anticipates and simulates future scenarios. Together, they establish a synergistic feedback loop: UB's real-time insights continuously inform UDT's strategic simulations, while UDT's long-range forecasts iteratively refine UB's operational decision-making. The framework thus equips researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with a robust methodology for designing and implementing adaptive, efficient, and resilient urban ecosystems. It facilitates the development of intelligent urban environments that can advance environmental sustainability by integrating solid theoretical foundations with actionable strategies.}

The reliance on legacy data and Big Data for AI training risks perpetuating outdated ideas and frameworks. As AI expands from automating tasks to interpreting and creating reconstructions, archaeologists must adopt a critical approach to avoid biased and harmful outputs. The deterministic view of AI hinders informed debate. Archaeologists should engage in discussions that address the classificatory, and ethical aspects as well as the materiality of AI. The accumulation of data in AI mimics storytelling but lacks the interpretative depth needed to understand historical human perspectives. Developing theories and narrative practices is essential to making archaeological data meaningful. The shift from a representational to a co-creative view of data is necessary to understand its re-use and the power dynamics involved.

abstract = {Background
As health care moves to a more digital environment, there is a growing need to train future family doctors on the clinical uses of artificial intelligence (AI). However, family medicine training in AI has often been inconsistent or lacking.
Objective
The aim of the study is to develop a curriculum framework for family medicine postgraduate education on AI called “Artificial Intelligence Training in Postgraduate Family Medicine Education” (AIFM-ed).
Methods
First, we conducted a comprehensive scoping review on existing AI education frameworks guided by the methodological framework developed by Arksey and O’Malley and Joanna Briggs Institute methodological framework for scoping reviews. We adhered to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist for reporting the results. Next, 2 national expert panels were conducted. Panelists included family medicine educators and residents knowledgeable in AI from family medicine residency programs across Canada. Participants were purposively sampled, and panels were held via Zoom, recorded, and transcribed. Data were analyzed using content analysis. We followed the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research for panels.
Results
An integration of the scoping review results and 2 panel discussions of 14 participants led to the development of the AIFM-ed curriculum framework for AI training in postgraduate family medicine education with five key elements: (1) need and purpose of the curriculum, (2) learning objectives, (3) curriculum content, (4) organization of curriculum content, and (5) implementation aspects of the curriculum.
Conclusions
Using the results of this study, we developed the AIFM-ed curriculum framework for AI training in postgraduate family medicine education. This framework serves as a structured guide for integrating AI competencies into medical education, ensuring that future family physicians are equipped with the necessary skills to use AI effectively in their clinical practice. Future research should focus on the validation and implementation of the AIFM-ed framework within family medicine education. Institutions also are encouraged to consider adapting the AIFM-ed framework within their own programs, tailoring it to meet the specific needs of their trainees and health care environments.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown potential in enhancing ECG analysis, but its accuracy in detecting atrial fibrillation (AF) in COVID-19 patients remains unstudied. Given the increased risk of arrhythmias and thromboembolic events in this population, AI could aid in timely correct diagnosis, reduce unnecessary consultations, tests, and minimize infection spread. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of the AI-based PMcardio application in detecting AF in COVID-19 patients.
Methods
The study analyzed 116 hospitalized COVID-19 consecutive patients using paper-based medical records, with a particular focus on ECGs. The presence and type of arrhythmias were determined by an experienced cardiologist and compared with assessments by the infectious disease specialists collected from patient medical records and the PMcardio application.
Results
The mean patient age was 63.28 (14.980) years. The PMcardio AI application demonstrated perfect diagnostic performance, achieving a sensitivity and specificity of 1.00 for AF detection compared to cardiologist's evaluations. Infectious disease specialists showed lower sensitivity (0.85) but retained high specificity (0.97). No significant association was found between the AI confidence score and diagnostic accuracy (p = 0.660), indicating consistent performance across confidence levels. Additionally, the AI's severity classification correlated significantly with rhythm diagnoses (p < 0.001).
Conclusions
AI-powered ECG analysis using PMcardio highly accurately detected AF in COVID-19 patients, outperforming infectious disease specialists and matching cardiologist's accuracy. The integration of AI in clinical practice may enhance arrhythmia detection and streamline diagnostic workflows, particularly in resource-limited and infectious disease settings.}

abstract = {Background
With the rapid development and increasing complexity of the modern food industry and food supply chain, consumers are placing ever-higher demands on food quality and safety. This trend is driving food companies to adopt rapid, efficient, and comprehensive monitoring systems, highlighting the urgent need for fast and reliable detection methods. While non-invasive testing (NIT) techniques offer efficient and non-invasive assessment, the demand for intelligent data interpretation and automated decision-making is growing. Artificial intelligence (AI) provides powerful tools for extracting meaningful patterns, enabling intelligent, accurate, and scalable food quality monitoring. The integration of AI with NIT represents a critical advancement, not only enhancing detection accuracy such as calibration error reduction by 10–20 % but also improving detection efficiency such as rapid screening within minutes for food quality and safety assessment.
Scope and approach
Improving the reliability of detection results and expanding the scale of rapid detection can effectively enhance the application value of NIT techniques in food production and distribution. Therefore, the current review aims to systematically explore how AI can assist NIT in food quality and safety applications, with a specific focus on two fundamental dimensions: accuracy and efficiency. Covering a wide range of NIT techniques and food detection targets, the current review is structured around two core perspectives: (1) enhancing accuracy through factor calibration, data enhancement, feature extraction and model optimization; and (2) improving efficiency through automation and robotics, portable device, high-throughput mode and IoT and blockchain. By summarizing key methods and advances from these two perspectives, this review provides a comprehensive framework and technical reference to guide future research and practical applications in intelligent food quality and safety assessment.
Key findings and conclusions
In summary, the integration of AI with NIT significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in food quality and safety assessment. Current challenges mainly involve limited interpretability, insufficient data diversity, and delays in industrial deployment. In the short term, progress is expected in interpretable and transferable AI models, multi-source sensor data fusion, and edge AI for real-time monitoring. In the longer term, disruptive technologies such as neural architecture search, neuromorphic computing, and quantum machine learning hold promise for transformative advances. By distinguishing feasible short-term developments from disruptive long-term opportunities, this review provides a roadmap to bridge scientific innovation and practical industrial application in AI-powered food NIT.}

abstract = {Background
The use of artificial intelligence for psychological advice shows promise for enhancing accessibility and reducing costs, but it remains unclear whether AI-generated advice can match the quality and empathy of experts.
Method
In a blinded, comparative cross-sectional design, licensed psychologists and psychotherapists assessed the quality, empathy, and authorship of psychological advice, which was either AI-generated or authored by experts.
Results
AI-generated responses were rated significantly more favorable for emotional (OR = 1.79, 95 % CI [1.1, 2.93], p = .02) and motivational empathy (OR = 1.84, 95 % CI [1.12, 3.04], p = .02). Ratings for scientific quality (p = .10) and cognitive empathy (p = .08) were comparable to expert advice. Participants could not distinguish between AI- and expert-authored advice (p = .27), but perceived expert authorship was associated with more favorable ratings across these measures (ORs for perceived AI vs. perceived expert ranging from 0.03 to 0.15, all p < .001). For overall preference, AI-authored advice was favored when assessed blindly based on its actual source (β = 6.96, p = .002). Nevertheless, advice perceived as expert-authored was also strongly preferred (β = 6.26, p = .001), with 93.55 % of participants preferring the advice they believed came from an expert, irrespective of its true origin.
Conclusions
AI demonstrates potential to match expert performance in asynchronous written psychological advice, but biases favoring perceived expert authorship may hinder its broader acceptance. Mitigating these biases and evaluating AI's trustworthiness and empathy are important next steps for safe and effective integration of AI in clinical practice.}

However, the need for comprehensive data on the ILs’ physical properties and functions with various substances complicates their green application-specific design and optimization. Thus, it is critical to review the recent advances in the computer-aided IL design. In particular, this review first summarizes the recent multi-scale molecular simulation study of ILs during the typical green chemical processes. Then, it turns to highlight recent progress in the artificial intelligence study of ILs including the physical and chemical properties prediction and high-throughput screening. Furthermore, combining the advantages of molecular simulation and artificial intelligence methods, we proposed the computer-aided IL design framework, where a case study for IL design based on the concept of green degree was demonstrated. We believe such a review can promote the development of computer-aided IL design as green solvents, paving their innovation applications in the field of high performance separation, reaction and other chemical engineering processes.}

While past technologies augment marketing capabilities, generative AI redistributes core creation, technical, and economic capabilities—challenging traditional agency–client dynamics and prompting strategic reconfigurations among incumbent firms. Drawing on a qualitative study of 22 professionals from CMAs and their clients, we develop a framework showing how generative AI enables widespread content marketing capabilities, alters content marketing market structures, and forces CMAs to redefine their value propositions. Our findings reveal a shift from execution-based services to expertise-driven roles, including creative consulting, hyper-personalization, and AI-enabled service innovation. We contribute theoretically by extending the concept of technology-enabled democratization, offering a structured framework that links capability redistribution, market restructuring, and incumbent response strategies. Practically, we propose a playbook to help CMAs adapt to this transformation through (1) strategic repositioning, (2) operational integration, (3) ethics, regulation, and compliance, (4) and market and client engagement.

abstract = {Introduction
Artificial intelligence–based chatbots are becoming increasingly used in patient education, in the realm of colorectal diseases. Perhaps, not surprisingly, concerns about the appropriateness of chatbot answers have been raised by healthcare professionals. Numerous studies have explored the utility and accuracy of chatbots in providing information in several clinical disciplines. This review aimed to summarize the findings of published studies, highlighting the strengths and limitations of chatbots used in medical education for colorectal surgery.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE via PubMed and Scopus in February 2025 for original articles evaluating artificial intelligence–based chatbots in patient education related to colorectal surgery, categorizing them into 3 groups: colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, and other colorectal conditions.
Results
We identified 15 studies, 9 assessed chatbot utility in patient education in colorectal cancer, 4 assessed their utility in inflammatory bowel diseases, 1 involved benign anal conditions, and another involved intestinal stomas. Our findings indicated that chatbots, particularly ChatGPT, can improve patient education by providing accessible information on common questions. However, we also identified several limitations of the ability of chatbots to address complex medical issues which underscored that these tools may complement rather than replace professional medical guidance.
Conclusion
Chatbots may be useful for patient education related to simple and basic information, but not in complex and patient-specific settings. Future research should focus on refining chatbot algorithms to enhance the accuracy and depth of their responses, ensuring they effectively support patient education while maintaining the crucial role of healthcare providers.}
