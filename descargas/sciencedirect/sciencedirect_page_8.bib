abstract = {Rare diseases (RD) are conditions affecting fewer than 1 in 2000 persons, with over 7000 largely genetic RDs affecting 3.5 %-5.9 % of the global population, or approximately 262.9–446.2 million people. The substantial healthcare burden and costs, such as the $1 trillion annual expense in the USA, highlight the urgent need for improved RD management. The International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) addresses this need through global collaboration, aiming for timely and accurate diagnosis, development of 1000 new therapies, and methodologies to measure impact by 2027. IRDiRC's initiatives include biannual meetings and workshops, like the AI-focused workshop in October 2023. This identified AI as crucial for advancing RD research and proposed a Framework for AI to enhance the RD patient journey by addressing efficiency and quality of life through modular solutions mapped to critical stages. The Framework integrates diverse data sources to improve diagnosis, treatment, and impact assessment, reflecting a holistic, cross-sector approach. By guiding multi-stakeholder efforts, the Framework aims to harness AI’s potential to significantly improve rare disease care.}

abstract = {Objective
Artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise in surgery, but its role in plastic surgery education remains underexplored. This review evaluates the current landscape of AI in plastic surgery education.
Design
A systematic search was conducted on August 11, 2024, across PubMed, CINAHL, IEEE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using terms related to AI, plastic surgery, and education. Original research articles focusing on AI in plastic surgery education were included, excluding correspondence, reviews, book chapters, theses, corrections, and non–peer-reviewed or non-English articles. Two investigators independently screened studies and synthesized data. ROBINS-I was used to assess bias.
Results
Fifteen studies were included, with 13 evaluating large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing, and Google Bard. ChatGPT-4 outperformed other models on In-Service Examinations (average score of 72.7%) and demonstrated potential as a teaching assistant in plastic surgery education. AI-generated personal statements were comparable to human-written ones. However, ChatGPT showed inaccuracies in generating surgical protocols. ChatGPT demonstrated its ability to provide qualitative predictions, forecasting survey results that indicated limited current use of AI in plastic surgery education but support for further AI research. a study combined ChatGPT with DALL-E 2, a generative model, to create acceptable educational images. Machine learning was used in 1 study for evaluating surgical skill and providing real-time feedback during liposuction. Nine studies had low risk of bias, while 6 had moderate risk.
Conclusions
AI demonstrates potential as an educational tool in plastic surgery. However, limitations of evidence, such as AI model uncertainties, introduce ambiguity. While AI cannot replicate the expertise of seasoned surgeons, it shows promise for foundational learning and skill assessment. Developing authenticity guidelines and enhancing AI capabilities are essential for its effective, ethical integration into plastic surgery education.}

We examine several specific issues, beginning with GAI’s heavy consumption of natural resources and electricity. We then move to assessing how the rich and the Global North gain via GAI, while the poor and the Global South must deal with its adverse effects. We then move to assessing GAI’s impact on underrepresented communities and countries in the Global South; while GAI contributes to global warming, this affects people unevenly, because it is mostly rich people and the Global North that make intensive use of these technologies. After suggesting that more local and global laws are needed to regulate the sustainable use of AI, we report on how organizations can perform AI strategizing, for instance to control emissions in smart cities and improve weather forecasting. We conclude with a research agenda that aims to encourage IS scholars to focus on the environmental impact of AI, its ethical implications for organizations, and how GAI can be used strategically to benefit all.}

However, factors driving AI adoption may differ between these two business types. This study investigates these differential factors by extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model and adding the perceived intelligence construct. The explanatory quantitative research design employs purposive sampling, collecting data from 322 respondents (247 MSMEs and 75 start-ups). This extended model is analyzed using variance-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and multi-group analysis (MGA). The PLS-SEM results show that for MSMEs, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and perceived intelligence significantly influence behavioral intention, which, along with facilitating conditions, drives actual use. Conversely, for startups, performance expectancy and effort expectancy mainly drive behavioral intention, which in turn leads to actual use. Crucially, the MGA confirms significant differences between the two business types in terms of the effect of effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and perceived intelligence on behavioral intention, as well as the effect of facilitating conditions on actual use. The study’s results contribute to the literature by validating the need for specific technology adoption models. Moreover, the study offers practical implications by emphasizing the importance of tailoring AI adoption strategies to the unique characteristics and needs of MSMEs and startups.}

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with high-throughput techniques has emerged as a powerful solution, revolutionizing the discovery and optimization of HEMs. This review highlights the synergistic paradigm of AI and high-throughput methods in HEMs research. High-throughput experimental approaches enable rapid screening of multiple compositions, while complementary computational methods provide theoretical insights and accelerate predictions of material properties. Machine learning models, ranging from supervised learning to unsupervised learning offer robust tools for predicting material properties, optimizing compositions, and discovering new materials. Generative models and inverse design approaches further enable the creation of novel HEMs with desired properties. The multi - objective optimization framework provides an effective means to find the best balance among multiple performance indicators. Large language models process and integrate massive amounts of data and extract key information, providing data-driven insights for the discovery of complex materials. The integration of these techniques into a closed-loop development system enables continuous feedback between experimental data, computational predictions, and machine learning models, thereby accelerating the discovery and optimization of HEMs, which not only streamlines the exploration of vast compositional spaces but also provides multi-scale insights into material behavior. As AI continues to evolve and integrate with emerging technologies, the future of HEM research holds great promise for sustainable development and accelerate their translation from the laboratory to practical applications.}

Through a qualitative analysis of nine focus groups involving 45 college students from diverse academic backgrounds, this study identifies three types of human-GenAI boundaries: complementary, competitive, and co-evolving. Complementary boundaries highlight GenAI's supportive and instrumental role and competitive boundaries emphasize human superiority and concerns over GenAI's threats, while co-evolving boundaries acknowledge dynamic interplay and reflective collaboration between humans and GenAI. The paper contributes theoretically by demonstrating that human-machine boundaries are dynamic, multifaceted, and actively negotiated. Practically, it offers insights into user strategies and implications for responsible adoption of GenAI technologies in educational and organizational contexts.}

abstract = {Introduction
Feedback is at the core of competency-based medical education. Learner perceptions of the evaluation process influence how feedback is utilized. Systems emphasize a fixed mindset, prioritizing evaluation over growth. Embracing growth mindset culture, the belief that ability is acquired through effort and human capabilities can be developed over time, will allow learners to gain greater benefits from feedback. Transitioning from fixed mindset language (FML) to growth mindset language (GML) will require faculty training. Artificial intelligence (AI) can assist faculty with incorporating GML concepts in written feedback. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of AI to assist in changing FML feedback statements into statements with GML.
Methods
A qualitative study was performed utilizing a sample of 83 summative and formative feedback statements provided to students (37) and residents (46) from surgery clerkship and national SIMPL-inguinal hernia evaluations. Of these 83 statements, a reviewer coded 41 statements as using GML and 42 using FML. Original statements identified as using FML were entered into the Google Chrome "Help me write" tool, a writing aid using Generative AI. The AI tool was prompted with the statement "rewrite using growth mindset language:," followed by an original FML statement. A dataset containing a combination of AI-altered and original statements, 99 statements in all, was provided to two additional blinded reviewers trained in GML concepts. Reviewers evaluated statements as predominantly GML or FML and commented on their perception of AI use in statements. Reviewer agreement was adjudicated by the original coder.
Results
Of the 41 original GML statements, coders correctly identified 37 (90.2%) as using GML. Of the 26 original FML statements, coders correctly identified all 26 (100%) as using FML. Of the AI-modified FML to GML statements, coders correctly identified 17 of 18 (94.4%) as using GML. They correctly identified 56.3% as AI-modified and 44.8% as not AI-modified statements. They disagreed on AI use in 39.4% of statements. AI-assistance was unrecognized in 16 (8.1%) statements and mistaken for use in 47 (23.7%) statements.
Conclusions
AI was successful at modifying FML statements into feedback containing GML, and in a way that was not obviously AI-generated. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that AI can be a helpful tool for faculty to increase the use of GML in written feedback. While AI cannot perfectly create GML feedback without initial input and understanding from faculty, it does serve as a promising educational aid. As the body of work on using GML in surgical education grows, the better AI can assist in the generation of quality feedback.}

In publishing, AI can potentially help to streamline the publication process in certain ways. Automated systems might screen manuscripts for methodological rigor, ethical compliance, and potential conflicts of interest, thereby reducing the burden on editors by prompting them to consider certain matters, and possibly accelerating the publication timeline. AI-powered tools are already used to help with dissemination of research findings by generating summaries and identifying key insights, making information more accessible to a broader audience. In the future, AI has the potential to enhance psychiatric publishing in various other ways. Predictive analytics might identify emerging trends and research gaps in the literature, guiding future studies and funding priorities, although this remains speculative for now. AI could also facilitate more robust collaborations by connecting researchers with complementary expertise and interests. Additionally, the integration of AI in digital platforms could democratise access to cutting-edge research, promote global knowledge sharing, and accelerate advancements in clinical care. As AI continues to evolve, its applications in research and publishing hold the potential to drive significant progress in understanding and treating mental disorders. It is essential that these developments are accompanied by openness about the use of AI in publishing, with clear declarations by authors and publishers about the use of specific applications in published work.}

We argue that these needs in sustainability science offer opportunities to develop trusted and transparent artificial intelligence (AI) based on principles that we define here as relevance, abundance, complexity, transferability, and specificity. Collaborations between AI and sustainability scientists should adopt the proposed “deep mutual learning” that integrates engagement with practitioners to build a shared incentive structure, and innovate question creation and an environment of co-creation with co-location. We emphasize a shared incentive structure that rests on fully integrating practitioners in the collaboration, including industry, municipalities, and the public. This approach will guide us towards sustainable policies with far-reaching societal benefits.}

This paper introduces Blockchain-Assisted Explainable Decision Traces (BAXDT), a novel architecture designed to enhance the transparency and auditability of AI systems. BAXDT creates comprehensive, immutable records for each AI decision by integrating model outputs, SHAP-based XAI summaries, a novel Explanation Density Metric, and detailed model/data context into a unified JSON trace. The 0.80 threshold for the Explanation Density Metric was empirically supported by Kneedle-based automatic threshold detection. The BAXDT architecture leverages blockchain by recording a cryptographic hash of each decision trace on-chain, while the full trace is stored off-chain. The system's effectiveness was demonstrated through a multi-faceted evaluation: simulations across three diverse public datasets (medical, financial, educational) confirmed its domain-agnostic applicability; a scalability analysis of up to 20,000 traces demonstrated its efficient and linear performance; and a successful deployment on the Ethereum Sepolia public testnet verified its real-world viability. A case study on text data further underscored the framework's flexibility. BAXDT provides a robust framework for documenting AI decisions - what, why, based on what, and when - thereby fostering trustworthy AI and supporting regulatory compliance.}

abstract = {Objective
We developed a novel slit-lamp photography (SLP) generative adversarial network (GAN) model using limited data to supplement and improve the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)–based microbial keratitis (MK) screening model.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Subjects
Slit-lamp photographs of 67 healthy and 36 MK eyes were prospectively and retrospectively collected at a tertiary care ophthalmology clinic at a large academic institution.
Methods
We trained the GAN model StyleGAN2-ADA on healthy and MK SLPs to generate synthetic images. To assess synthetic image quality, we performed a visual Turing test. Three cornea fellows tested their ability to identify 20 images each of (1) real healthy, (2) real diseased, (3) synthetic healthy, and (4) synthetic diseased. We also used Kernel Inception Distance (KID) to quantitatively measure realism and variation of synthetic images. Using the same dataset used to train the GAN model, we trained 2 DenseNet121 AI models to grade SLP images as healthy or MK with (1) only real images and (2) real supplemented with GAN-generated images.
Main Outcome Measures
Classification performance of MK screening models trained with only real images compared to a model trained with both limited real and supplemented synthetic GAN images.
Results
For the visual Turing test, the fellows on average rated synthetic images as good quality (83.3% ± 12.0% of images), and synthetic and real images were found to depict pertinent anatomy and pathology for accurate classification (96.3% ± 2.19% of images). These experts could distinguish between real and synthetic images (accuracy: 92.5% ± 9.01%). Analysis of KID score for synthetic images indicated realism and variation. The MK screening model trained on both limited real and supplemented synthetic data (area under the receiver–operator characteristic curve: 0.93, bootstrapping 95% CI: 0.77–1.0) outperformed the model trained with only real data (area under the receiver–operator characteristic curve: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.50–1.0), with an improvement of 0.17 (95% CI: 0–0.4; 2-tailed t test P = 0.076).
Conclusions
Artificial intelligence–based MK classification may be improved by supplementation of limited real training data with synthetic data generated by GANs.

Adopting a four-wave, time-lagged research design, data were gathered from 849 employed adults in South Korea, yielding 363 usable responses. The measurement model was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis, which demonstrated the distinctiveness of the core constructs. Structural equation modeling assessed the hypothesized relationships and revealed that OPP had no direct effect on innovation; rather, its impact was mediated by PCB, which occurs when employees perceive the unyielding demands of an organization as violating mutual obligations, and subsequently by KHB, which refers to individuals withholding work-related information. This chain of unfavorable perceptions and behaviors ultimately diminishes organization-level innovation capacity. Furthermore, AITA functioned as a crucial buffer in the link between OPP and PCB, signifying that employees who were more receptive to AI tools were less likely to interpret perfectionistic standards as unfair. This study’s findings enhance the current theoretical discourse by highlighting a multi-level explanatory process that elucidates how externally imposed performance pressure erodes innovation potential. The results also demonstrate technological acceptance’s pivotal role in mitigating such challenges.}

To determine the value of an artificial intelligence (AI)-image generation learning sequence on higher-education nursing student self-reflection and recognition of unconscious bias in the context of disability.
Background
Self-reflection and recognition of bias amongst undergraduate nursing students enhances reasoning skills and self-awareness in clinical situations. Teaching self-reflection to a diverse cohort can be challenging, making it essential to develop and assess innovative technological tools that support engagement in reflective practice.
Design
A multi-methods approach was adopted, obtaining both quantitative and qualitative data for analysis through a survey.
Methods
Twenty-nine nursing students from the Australian Catholic University were surveyed. Qualitative data underwent both content and inductive thematic analysis. Quantitative data were summarised using descriptive statistics. The study is reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) cross-sectional study guideline.
Results
AI-image generation aided self-reflection on personal views about disability and recognition of potential personal and society biases towards disability amongst 90 % (n = 26) and 70 % of participants respectively. Visualisation of thoughts supported self-reflection and identification of generalisations held about disability. Eighty percent of respondents felt AI-image generation prompted them to consider how views and biases about disability may influence nursing practice. AI-image generation was identified to be an interesting and novel tool for self-reflection.
Conclusion
Findings suggest AI-image generation may be a useful tool in supporting students to practice self-reflection and identify unconscious biases. AI-image generation may assist students to consider how personal views can impact on clinical practice.}

abstract = {Purpose
Through a systematic content analysis, this paper aims to examine the current use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the services of the top 100 US university libraries and explores the key factors that influence the adoption of this technology. It seeks to provide actionable strategic recommendations for library administrators. These recommendations aim to help libraries accelerate their intelligent service transformation while maintaining their academic resource advantages and humanistic traditions, and to establish a solid theoretical and empirical foundation for future research.
Design/methodology/approach
The authors analyse the current status of libraries adopting AI technologies and applying them to patron services, which include intelligent retrieval services, intelligent reference services, intelligent guided tour services and intelligent ID recognition services, among others. Firstly, the authors visit the official websites of the top 100 US university libraries to collect information. Subsequently, the prevalence of AI technologies is statistically analysed, and several excellent practice cases are selected. Finally, based on the data obtained from the content analysis, the impact of university rankings on the adoption of AI technologies in US university libraries is analysed.
Findings
The study finds that AI technologies are widely applied in the services of US university libraries, but there are differences in the adoption rates across different services. Almost all libraries have adopted intelligent retrieval and recommendation technology (99%). In terms of intelligent reference services, more than half of the libraries have used AI technologies (53%). Intelligent guided tour technology is also widely adopted (95%). The application of intelligent ID recognition technology in libraries is equally common (98%). Furthermore, more than half of the libraries have begun to explore generative AI technologies (61%). Additionally, the study further discovers that there is a significant negative correlation between university rankings and the number of AI technologies adopted by libraries. This indicates that top-ranked universities are more likely to introduce a variety of AI technologies in their library services.
Research limitations/implications
The study’s implications include constructing an analytical framework to assess AI in library services and identifying key adoption factors. It explores AI’s impact on service diversity and the popularity of different services. Notably, it finds a link between university rankings and AI adoption, offering insights into the relationship between tech adoption and institutional reputation.
Originality/value
This paper provides the latest statistical data on the use of AI technologies in US university libraries. It aims to help librarians understand the overall application situation and best practices. With these insights, librarians can develop corresponding plans to better use AI to serve patrons.}

Meanwhile, the industry is shifting towards a more human-centric, sustainable, and resilient paradigm, which is envisioned as a value-oriented Industry 5.0. Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown promising benefits, but challenges persist in the proper orchestration between AI and human beings. Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) emphasizes that AI systems should enhance and complement human abilities rather than replace humans. It focuses on the interaction between humans and AI, aims to improve human well-being, and ensures that AI technologies are consistent with human values and needs. HCAI prioritizes user experience and ethical considerations by following three principles: being inspired by human intelligence, guided by human impact, and augmenting human capabilities. This paper examines the growing trend of deep integration between AI and human intelligence in industries, emphasizing that AI development necessitates the interdependence of technology, people, and ethics to create reliable, safe, and trustworthy systems. This paper conducts a detailed analysis of the evolution stages and modes of human-AI collaboration in industry. Based on an in-depth examination of enablers of HCAI models in industry, this paper examines HCAI applications for the product lifecycle management. Social barriers, technology challenges, and future research directions of HCAI are underscored, respectively. We believe that our effort lays a foundation for unlocking the power of HCAI during the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0.}

abstract = {Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide, and the ability to predict PPH may help address preventable causes of morbidity and mortality such as delays in care. Understanding the importance of standardized approaches to PPH, the National Partnership for Maternal Safety Consensus Bundle on Obstetric Hemorrhage outlines four critical domains for safe and effective PPH care: 1) Readiness; 2) Recognition and Prevention; 3) Response; and 4) Reporting and System Learning. The Recognition and Prevention domain includes recommendations for standardized methods of PPH risk prediction, and The Joint Commission now requires use of an evidence-based PPH prediction tool. Postpartum hemorrhage risk predictions can be accomplished via checklist tools completed manually by healthcare providers or via machine-assisted calculations in the form of logistic regression or machine learning populated by automated electronic health record data. The latter examples of machine-assisted calculations of PPH risk are a form of artificial intelligence. The purpose of this review is to describe the current state of AI-based PPH risk assessment, including the application of logistic regression and machine learning. A primer on interpretation of such models is provided, along with identification of research gaps and future directions.}

Previous research suggests that these agents (e.g., chatbots) should embed human behavioral traits such as warmth, competence, and even automated social presence (i.e., perceiving that one is interacting with someone else). However, it is unknown whether different levels of AI are perceived by customers as features increasing humanness and, subsequently, leading to higher functional, monetary, social, or emotional value. Through an experimental design based on tourism chatbots, the results from structural equation analysis reveal that whereas mechanical AI decreases automated social presence, analytical AI increases perceptions of competence and warmth, and emotional AI improves all humanness cues. The article merges the research streams of service agent design and customers’ perceptions of humanness to guide tourism managers in implementing generative AI agents to increase service value.}

This paper explores the considerable implications of data scarcity for the AI industry, which threatens to restrict its growth and potential, and proposes plausible solutions and perspectives. In addition, this article focuses highly on different ethical considerations: privacy, consent, and non-discrimination principles during AI model developments under limited conditions. Besides, innovative technologies are investigated through the paper in aspects that need implementation by incorporating transfer learning, few-shot learning, and data augmentation to adapt models so they could fit effective use processes in low-resource settings. This thus emphasizes the need for collaborative frameworks and sound methodologies that ensure applicability and fairness, tackling the technical and ethical challenges associated with data scarcity in AI. This article also discusses prospective approaches to dealing with data scarcity, emphasizing the blend of synthetic data and traditional models and the use of advanced machine learning techniques such as transfer learning and few-shot learning.

abstract = {Background
Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is a common electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Although artificial intelligence (AI)–driven ECG analysis shows promise for LVSD screening, it remains unclear if a general AI-ECG model or one tailored for LBBB patients yields better performance.
Objectives
This study evaluates 4 AI-ECG models for detecting LVSD in LBBB patients and examines the impact of training cohort definitions.
Methods
We developed 4 models using 364,845 ECGs from 4 hospitals: 1) a general AI-ECG model; 2) a model trained on automatically extracted LBBB cases; 3) a model trained on a well-curated single-center LBBB data set with expert review; and 4) a hybrid model employing transfer learning by fine-tuning the general model with single-center LBBB data. LVSD was defined as an ejection fraction ≤40%. All models were externally validated on 1,334 ECGs from another hospital, with performance assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
Results
In external validation, the transfer learning model achieved the highest AUROC (0.903; 95% CI: 0.887-0.918), closely followed by the general model (0.899; 95% CI: 0.883-0.915); the difference was not significant. Models using automated or expert-based LBBB extraction had lower AUROCs (0.879 and 0.841, respectively). The general model demonstrated high sensitivity, whereas the transfer learning model exhibited superior specificity.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that a broad AI-ECG model reliably detects LVSD in LBBB patients, and transfer learning offers modest improvements without requiring curated LBBB data sets. Evaluating algorithms in representative clinical populations is essential.}

This study investigates whether and how AI Policy Uncertainty (AIPU) drives corporate greenwashing. Using a large panel of Chinese listed firms from 2010–Q1 2025 and a novel text-based index of AIPU, we establish a causal link through a multi-pronged identification strategy that includes Propensity Score Matching (PSM), a multi-period Difference-in-Differences (DID) design, and an Instrumental Variable (IV) analysis. We find robust evidence that AIPU significantly increases corporate greenwashing. Crucially, this effect is attenuated for firms led by CEOs with strong IT backgrounds, who can better navigate technological turbulence. We further unveil the micro-foundations of this effect, showing that AIPU fuels greenwashing through three distinct mediating pathways: splitting managerial attention toward external risks (a cognitive channel), increasing precautionary cash holdings (a financial channel), and directly inhibiting substantive green innovation (a strategic channel). Heterogeneity analysis also shows the effect is more pronounced for non-state-owned enterprises and non-high-tech firms. Our findings reveal an important unintended consequence of technology governance and offer crucial insights for managers, investors, and policymakers.}

Artificial intelligence has emerged as a promising tool to optimize patient care in the field of cardiovascular medicine. However, data on its adoption and utilization by healthcare professionals are scarce.
Aim
To explore the factors that support or hinder the adoption of artificial intelligence in cardiology in France.
Methods
The INSIGHT-AI France study is a two-wave longitudinal panel survey recontacting the same individuals after 12 months, targeting professionals involved in the management of patients with cardiovascular diseases, including senior cardiologists, residents, nurses, technicians, engineers and decision-makers involved in artificial intelligence development. Participants from academic, public non-academic and private hospitals were recruited using a stratified sampling approach to capture diverse perspectives. Data were collected via SKEZIA, a platform compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation, with secure authentication and longitudinal tracking capabilities. The baseline survey, distributed from December 2024 to March 2025, assessed knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices related to artificial intelligence in cardiology. A follow-up survey will be conducted 12 months later to evaluate changes over time. The survey was developed by a scientific committee, with feedback from artificial intelligence and cardiology experts, and was pilot-tested for feasibility. Statistical analyses will include mixed-effects models and regression analyses.
Conclusions
This is the first study designed to explore the acceptance and limitation of artificial intelligence use in cardiovascular medicine in France. By identifying key facilitators and barriers, this study aims to inform strategic initiatives for more effective and equitable artificial intelligence implementation in French-speaking healthcare systems.}

This thematic review distinguishes basic AI adoption from AI realization—the sustainable ability to embed, scale, and profit from AI through coherent data, skills, and routines. Three research strands are synthesised. First, the literature consistently identifies three driver groups—people, technical, and managerial—that accelerate or hinder realization. Second, progress is usually gauged with three measurement families: text mining of corporate filings, proxy indicators such as AI-related patents or robot density, and survey-based capability indices. Third, realised AI affects three performance domains: operational, financial, and environmental. Within O&G, value chain stage (upstream, midstream, downstream) and ownership model (state-owned and privately owned) modulate both measurement validity and outcome strength. These strands are integrated into a conceptual synthesis that links drivers to gauges and gauges to results, stressing triangulation across indicators to limit bias. Triangulated dashboards linking capability scores to these outcomes expose trade-offs, such as efficiency gains that raise energy use. Recommended actions for practitioners include: connecting operational, financial, and sustainability databases; deploying an annual “AI readiness” survey covering data, talent, and governance; and adopting shared reporting rules that enable cross-company learning. For scholars, the paper highlights measurement gaps, suggests triangulated research designs, and maps boundary conditions needing further study. Together, the insights give executives a firmer basis for allocating AI budgets and give researchers a clearer roadmap toward comparative, evidence-based evaluation of AI value in complex, asset-intensive settings.}

As a result of the descriptive analysis, five main themes were identified: critical content production and evaluation, metacognitive skills and self-regulation, ethical thinking and evaluation, analytical thinking and problem solving, motivation and self-efficacy for the AI-assisted writing process and critical literacy skills. Our findings show that students use AI tools not as a simple copy-paste tool, but as a supportive element to develop their thinking. Students question AI outputs, synthesize them with their own ideas and manage their writing processes more consciously. The findings of our study reveal that AI-assisted writing experiences increase students' ethical awareness of originality, academic honesty and creativity, improve their systematic thinking skills in complex writing tasks, and increase their motivation to write. However, the lack of any study at preschool level, the limited number of studies at primary school level, and the scarcity of qualitative studies indicate that more research is needed in this field.}

abstract = {Background
In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence technologies for emotional support in healthcare settings has increased. However, less is known about the quality and effectiveness of artificial intelligence-based emotional support.
Objectives
This scoping review aimed to investigate the characteristics, supporting content, and outcomes (usability, acceptability, and effectiveness) of artificial intelligence-based emotional support in healthcare settings.
Methods
The scoping review followed the five-stage framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley and the reporting standards established in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. In July 2025, literature searches were conducted across 10 databases without restrictions on study design. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess quality. Results were synthesized narratively.
Results
A total of 20 studies involving 4703 participants were included. Some studies exhibited methodological limitations, including insufficient blinding and inadequate control of confounding factors. Artificial intelligence-based emotional support systems varied in their technical characteristics, with cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness being the most common foundation for the design of supportive content. Among patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers, these systems demonstrated a degree of usability and acceptability and were effective in improving a range of emotional states and emotion-related capacities. However, limitations persisted regarding technology, supportive content, specific emotional indicators, and sustained effectiveness.
Conclusion
This review identified substantial heterogeneity in the technologies and supportive content of artificial intelligence-based emotional support in healthcare settings. While these systems show promising potential, their limitations must be carefully considered in practice. Future research should adopt more rigorous experimental designs and increase nurse involvement in both technology development and study implementation. This review can help nursing professionals better understand and utilize artificial intelligence to provide emotional support and improve patients' emotional well-being.

This approach has become increasingly important in synthetic biology because it allows for quick testing of ideas, running many experiments simultaneously, and maintaining tight control over reaction conditions. The main challenge has been figuring out how to optimize these systems, since there are so many variables that interact in unpredictable ways. Artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning, deep learning, and generative models, has begun to tackle this problem by helping predict experimental outcomes, design new proteins, and find better reaction conditions. The discovery of antimicrobial peptides through deep learning and cell-free protein synthesis, along with a 34-fold increase in protein yield through buffer optimization guided by active learning, are some of the major advancements made possible. The use of Bayesian optimization and neural networks has helped to streamline metabolic pathway designing, enzyme engineering as well as yield prediction, which in turn has diversified the use of AI-driven approaches in biomanufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics. In spite of hurdles like data requirements, model transferability, and scalability, the compatibility of AI and cell-free systems gives adequate probabilities of innovations like digital twins and self-driven biomanufacturing units. This chapter explores the integration of AI with cell-free systems, focusing on recent advances, industrial applications, and ending with future directions for synthetic biology.}

Smart drug delivery systems can transfer drugs to specific tissues and cells, enhancing therapeutic effects while reducing undesirable side effects. Attention is focused on the main concepts and techniques of AI such as machine learning, deep learning, and genetic algorithms. In addition to this, genetic algorithms can be used for the selection of the best numerical models, which are able to predict biological processes or optimize the activity of new drugs. Besides the powerful impact of AI on drug design, its combination with new biotechnologies for personalized medicine, sometimes called theragnostics, brings novel diagnostic tools together with targeted therapy, which could ensure quality and effectiveness during clinical research on new drugs. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are finding their application in almost all disciplines, with particular success in healthcare. AI-based algorithms can solve complex problems related to diagnosis, prediction, control, and prevention of diseases that are beyond the scope of human abilities. At the same time, the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution has added value to the healthcare sector. The resulting combination of IoT and AI platforms presents a promising fusion to provide healthcare delivery innovations like digital drug delivery, online healthcare consultancy platforms, and virtual healthcare assistants. Personalized medicine is well-suited, regardless of potential disadvantages, to creating drug delivery systems that can respond to the exact needs and other special requirements of patients. The development of smart drug delivery systems is a potential response to the unimodal properties of drugs and the discordance between patient requirements and patient outcomes achieved by currently prescribed medications. The potential and actual positive economic and health-related impacts of advanced drug delivery technologies have created strong demand for new advanced delivery forms.}

abstract = {Background
This study aims to determine the efficacy of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in rewriting orthopaedic trauma hospital patient educational materials to a patient-appropriate reading level.
Materials and methods
35 orthopaedic patient educational articles were identified from three hospital networks with Level 1 Trauma Centers, categorized based on average reading level. They were run through a formatting Python code, and then a secondary code to determine readability metrics outlined in Table 1. The articles were then rewritten via four iterations of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) AI language models. Each model was given the same prompt, outlined in Fig. 1, to rewrite the articles to a 6th grade reading level per AMA recommendations. The rewritten articles were checked for accuracy and formatted and scored to determine mean reading level. Additional analysis was run comparing 9 different AI models from 3 different companies, using the same prompt, comparing cost and percent token reduction.
Results
All GPT AI models lowered the mean combined grade level (Table 2). Fig. 2 compares each GPT model's output to the original articles reading grade level. The oldest model (GPT-3.5-Turbo) was the least consistent and least effective. GPT-4o-Mini and GPT-4o were the most effective and consistent regardless of original article difficulty. Table 3 outlines the cost of running all 35 articles through each GPT model. The most accurate model (GPT-4o) was only $0.61; however, there was only a 0.421 % increase in effectiveness comparing GPT-4o vs. GPT-4o-Mini, at a 175.38 % increase in cost. All GPT rewritten articles were screened for accuracy and determined to have no falsified information or medical inaccuracies. Expanded analysis across 9 AI models is demonstrated in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 compares cost and percent token reduction.
Conclusion
AI is a viable option for reducing the reading difficulty of patient educational materials while maintaining accuracy. Of the models included for analysis, GPT-4o-Mini appears to be the most efficient language model when considering effectiveness, cost, and maintenance of the information included in the original articles.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Within public online forums, patients often seek reassurance and guidance from the community regarding postoperative symptoms and expectations, and when to seek medical assistance. Others are using artificial intelligence in the form of online search engines or chatbots such as ChatGPT or Perplexity. Artificial intelligence chatbot assistants have been growing in popularity; however, clinicians may be hesitant to use them because of concerns about accuracy. The online networking service for medical professionals, Doximity, has expanded its resources to include a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant artificial intelligence writing assistant, Doximity GPT, designed to reduce the administrative burden on clinicians. Health professionals learn using a “medical model,” which greatly differs from the “health belief model” that laypeople learn through. This mismatch in learning perspectives likely contributes to a communication mismatch even during digital clinician–patient encounters, especially in patients with limited health literacy during the perioperative period when complications may arise.
OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to evaluate the ability of artificial intelligence chatbot assistants (Doximity GPT, Perplexity, and ChatGPT) to generate quality, accurate, and empathetic responses to postoperative patient queries that are also understandable and actionable.
STUDY DESIGN
Responses to 10 postoperative queries sourced from HysterSisters, a public forum for “woman-to-woman hysterectomy support,” were generated using 3 artificial intelligence chatbot assistants (Doximity GPT, Perplexity, and ChatGPT) and a minimally invasive gynecologic surgery fellowship–trained surgeon. Ten physician evaluators compared the blinded responses for quality, accuracy, and empathy. A separate pair of physician evaluators scored the responses for understandability and actionability using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Printable Materials (PEMAT-P). The final scores were the average of both reviewers’ scores. Analysis of variance was used for pairwise comparison of the evaluator scores between sources. Lastly, the Kruskal–Wallis test was used to analyze Flesch–Kincaid scoring for readability. The Pearson chi-square test was used to demonstrate the difference in reading level among the responses for each source.
RESULTS
Compared with a physician, Doximity GPT and ChatGPT were rated as more empathetic than a minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon, but quality and accuracy were similar across these sources. There was a significant difference between Perplexity and the other response sources, favoring the latter, for quality and accuracy (P<.001). Perplexity and the minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon ranked similarly for empathy. Reading ease was greater for the minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon responses (60.6 [53.5–68.4]; eighth and ninth grade) than for Perplexity (40.0 [28.6–47.2], college) and ChatGPT (35.5 [28.2–42.0], college) (P<.01). There was no significant difference in understandability and actionability, with all sources scored as having good understandability and average actionability.
CONCLUSION
As artificial intelligence chatbot assistants grow in popularity, including integration in the electronic health record, the output’s readability must reflect the general population’s health literacy to be impactful and effective. This analysis serves as a reminder for physicians to be mindful of this mismatch in readability and general health literacy when considering the integration of artificial intelligence chatbot assistants into patient care. The accuracy and consistency of these chatbots may also impact patient outcomes, making screening of utmost importance in this endeavor.}

Systematic reviews require substantial time and effort. This study compared the results of conducting reviews by human reviewers with those conducted with Artificial Intelligence (AI). We identified 11 AI tools that could assist in conducting a systematic review. None of the AI tools could retrieve all articles that were detected with a manual search strategy. We identified tools for deduplication but did not evaluate them. AI screening tools assist the human reviewer in presenting the most relevant article on top, which could reduce the number of articles that need to be screened on title and abstract, and on full text. There was a poor inter-rater reliability to evaluate the risk of bias between AI tools and the human reviewers. A summary table created by AI tools differs substantially from manually constructed summary tables. This study highlights the potential of AI tools to support systematic reviews, particularly during screening phases, but not to replace human reviews.}

abstract = {Quantum Computing (QC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have emerged as key technologies in the evolution of Industry 6.0, driving advancements in automation and advanced analytics, and process optimization. Their integration holds the potential to revolutionize sectors such as data science, healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity by enabling faster and more efficient computations through qubits, superposition, and quantum entanglement. However, the lack of structured knowledge regarding specific QC methodologies and applications in AI hinders its optimal implementation and development. Consequently, this study aims to identify the applications and variables associated with QC-AI integration. To this end, a systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 methodology, drawing on studies from Scopus and Web of Science databases. This enabled the analysis of trends, limitations, and opportunities in this technological convergence. This study aims to systematically examine the intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence by identifying the key technological features, integration requirements, and sectoral applications that define the current state of the field. The review contributes by mapping existing research, highlighting methodological approaches, and revealing gaps that may guide targeted advancements in hybrid quantum AI systems. The insights generated have the potential to accelerate innovation in high-impact domains such as healthcare, finance, energy, and cybersecurity. The findings indicate that the main advances in QC applied to AI focus on quantum optimization, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), and post-quantum cryptography. Notably, sectors such as energy, healthcare, and finance have shown significant progress in adopting these technologies. For example, in healthcare, QML has been applied to simulate molecular interactions to accelerate drug discovery, and in finance, it enhances predictive models for market behavior. The study concludes that although QC demonstrates substantial potential to enhance AI, its broader adoption remains constrained by reliance on NISQ hardware, the need for effective error correction, and the limited scalability of hybrid quantum classical algorithms. Addressing these challenges will be essential to establishing QML as a cornerstone of technological innovation and digital transformation. Additionally, this review introduces an integrative framework that categorizes key AI QC convergence dimensions and proposes a classification of application areas based on technical requirements and algorithmic capabilities. These contributions aim to guide future experimental validations and hybrid model development.}

Innovative teaching approaches will be employed for the broad spectrum of students; integrating AI across all levels of Bloom's processes-from production, comprehension, application, clinical case scenario harbingers, dynamic information delivery, and interactive teaching. Mixed-method design comprising both the quantitative (survey based analysis) and the qualitative (far-reaching theoretical framework and case studies review) methodologies was used in the current study. A structured survey was administered to collect data on the AI pattern, efficacy, and frequency of usage among 181 health sciences students. Case studies in practice were also used to serve as evidence of AI's role in medical training: from clinician-initiated simulations to AI-powered assessment tools. The data analysis approaches included descriptive statistics, correlation heat maps, and comparative analysis between AI-assisted teaching and standard teaching. It is concluded that such engagement of the use of AI makes for engagement and deep learning but requires strong institution-wide foundations and ethical frameworks, and measures of growth against institutional preparedness and of having a very rich ethical framework for risk management are still lacking. Hence, the study recommends that balancing technology with ethics would be needed in AI integration and proposes future studies to address gaps in teacher training, institution preparedness, and ethical consideration.}

Although rudimentary compared to modern artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) techniques, the development of these systems nearly 20 years ago led to increased diagnostic performance, with potential to address issues relating to speed, throughput and reliability of cytologic assessment. However, rather than ushering in an age of increasing automation and quantitative analysis, algorithmic advances in cytology (and pathology in general), stagnated for approximately a decade after its introduction. In the 2010’s, the advent of AlexNet, coupled with plummeting storage and GPU costs, open-source development environments and the marketing of affordable, high throughput digital slide scanners accelerated progress and interest in digital pathology AI/ML applications. While the widespread adoption of large-scale consortium level datasets (e.g., The Cancer Genome Atlas) spurred the development of AI/ML methods for surgical pathology, large-scale collection, and algorithmic modeling of cytology specimens has lagged behind due to the varied nature of cytology preparations and assessment. However, increasing attention has been paid to cytopathology with a commensurate increase in publications and commercial applications in this area. Still, the applications of AI/ML to cytopathology and the herculean effort to implement fully digital pathology services remain in its nascent stages. This review explores the current state of research and commercial development in digital cytopathology, with a focus on AI/ML technologies.}

Staggered difference-in-differences analysis shows that sustained AI adoption is associated with a 14% increase in new apprenticeships among training firms (intensive margin), but is not linked to the training decision (extensive margin). AI adoption is also associated with a modest increase in continuing training, with resources shifting toward high-skilled employees. The results align with AI as an automation innovation that reduces demand for simple skills as well as an augmentation innovation that increases demand for more advanced skills.

abstract = {Summary
CNS cancers are complex, difficult-to-treat malignancies that remain insufficiently understood and mostly incurable, despite decades of research efforts. Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to reshape neuro-oncological practice and research, driving advances in medical image analysis, neuro–molecular–genetic characterisation, biomarker discovery, therapeutic target identification, tailored management strategies, and neurorehabilitation. This Review examines key opportunities and challenges associated with AI applications along the neuro-oncological care trajectory. We highlight emerging trends in foundation models, biophysical modelling, synthetic data, and drug development and discuss regulatory, operational, and ethical hurdles across data, translation, and implementation gaps. Near-term clinical translation depends on scaling validated AI solutions for well defined clinical tasks. In contrast, more experimental AI solutions offer broader potential but require technical refinement and resolution of data and regulatory challenges. Addressing both general and neuro-oncology-specific issues is essential to unlock the full potential of AI and ensure its responsible, effective, and needs-based integration into neuro-oncological practice.}

To summarize the relevance of remote symptom monitoring, person-centered statistical analyses, and artificial intelligence to precision health symptom science in oncology; and propose ways in which these three approaches can be integrated to further advance the field.
Methods
The following commentary was adapted from a talk delivered at the Symptom Science Experts Meeting in October 2023 at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. The commentary and talk were informed by an informal review of recent literature in precision health oncology symptom science.
Results
Several remote symptom monitoring interventions have demonstrated potential to reduce disease- and treatment-related symptom burden and improve health outcomes in patients with cancer. Data collected passively by wearable and sensor technologies are also being used to characterize patients’ health status. Person-centered statistical analyses have identified interindividual variability in the symptom experiences of patients with cancer. Together with artificial intelligence-based approaches, these analyses have identified factors associated with relatively adverse symptom experiences. Future directions for the field include integrating these approaches to optimize clinical resource allocation, tailor symptom management in real-time, and advance scientific knowledge of the symptom experience.
Conclusions
Integrating remote symptom monitoring, person-centered statistical analyses and artificial intelligence may provide deeper insights into how patients with cancer experience symptoms.
Implications for Nursing Practice
Findings from research that uses remote symptom monitoring, person-centered statistical analyses, and artificial intelligence may enhance clinicians’ ability to deliver personalized symptom management interventions.}

However, the nonlinear and weather-dependent behavior of photovoltaic systems poses challenges for accurate diagnosis. This study presents a large-scale review of 983 scientific publications on artificial intelligence-based photovoltaic fault detection, using a novel methodology called Topic-tSNE Fusion. This approach integrates topic modeling, dimensionality reduction, and expert analysis to extract and visualize dominant research themes. Four key machine learning paradigms are identified: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. Among them, supervised methods, particularly neural networks and support vector machines, are the most frequently applied, showing accuracies above 95% in controlled conditions. The analysis also reveals growing use of semi-supervised and hybrid approaches to overcome data scarcity. Commonly monitored variables include irradiance, voltage, and current, while the most studied faults are shading, open-circuit, and degradation. Several open-access datasets supporting fault diagnosis research are catalogued. Overall, the proposed method enables a more objective and scalable review process and uncovers emerging trends, such as the shift toward lightweight artificial intelligence for edge deployment and frugal diagnostic architectures. The methodology is scalable and adaptable to other domains facing similar challenges in knowledge synthesis and system monitoring.}

Nowadays, cultivating DT within any educational program is becoming increasingly important for teachers since Artificial Intelligence (AI) and chatbots are available to all students. However, teachers themselves need to possess DT competency to effectively cultivate it in their students, particularly in humanistic fields like applied linguistics, Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL), and Artificial Intelligence Language Teaching (AILT). For this reason, the researcher in the current study developed a new conceptual framework and a scale specifically designed for the field of AILT, known as Language Teachers’ Design Thinking Competence in Artificial Intelligence Language Teaching (LTDTAILT). The researcher generated the items both deductively and inductively, evaluating their face and content validity through the Delphi methodology and a cognitive review. Having piloted the scale, the researcher distributed it to 273 in-service English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers in Spain who had experience teaching languages using AI. The validation process, which included the Rasch-Andrich rating scale model (RSM), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), confirmed that the theoretical framework and its scale were well-aligned and validated to study context and the field, comprising five components: empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and test, with a total of 17 items. Consequently, the researcher established a new theoretical framework applicable to the fields of artificial intelligence in general and specifically to CALL and AILT. Furthermore, this framework provides a pathway for English teachers and researchers to stay current with developments in other fields that integrate 21st-century digital skills and competencies through the application of artificial intelligence.}
