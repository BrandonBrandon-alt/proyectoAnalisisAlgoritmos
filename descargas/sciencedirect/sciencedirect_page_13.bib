abstract = {The growing demand for clean energy and the limitations of conventional thermal systems necessitates the integration of advanced technologies to enhance efficiency, adaptability, and sustainability. This review critically examines recent advancements in the application of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence for optimizing thermal energy systems, including solar collectors, heat exchangers, and latent heat storage units. Nanotechnology (particularly the use of nano-enhanced phase change materials and nanofluids such as Al₂O₃ and CuO) has shown to improve thermal conductivity by up to 28.8 %, accelerating energy absorption and storage rates. Concurrently, artificial intelligence algorithms, especially artificial neural networks and particle swarm optimization, enable predictive modelling, real-time system control, and fault detection, with some models achieving prediction accuracies above 97 % under complex operational conditions. The review emphasizes the synergistic potential of combining these technologies to create intelligent, self-regulating thermal energy systems. However, the paper also identifies critical challenges including computational overhead, cost of nanoparticle synthesis, lack of reproducibility in artificial intelligence implementations, and insufficient validation under extreme scenarios. Commercial deployment case studies (such as artificial intelligence-driven phase change material-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in smart buildings) are discussed to illustrate practical viability, reporting energy savings of up to 28 % with return-on-investment periods under three years. The paper concludes by proposing integrated research directions that combine multiscale material innovation with robust artificial intelligence training on dynamic datasets. This dual approach is essential to developing scalable, cost-effective, and resilient thermal energy systems capable of supporting global energy transitions.}

A SWOT matrix distils convergent concerns—weaponised disinformation, privacy erosion, and the detection arms race—alongside under-explored opportunities in education, therapy, and creative industries. To test whether these scholarly themes resonate with citizens, a computer-assisted web survey (N = 7,083) measured perceived risks and benefits across 10 specific scenarios for each theme. Correspondence analysis and Bonferroni-adjusted means reveal a pronounced age gradient for benefits, whereas risk perceptions vary by country—younger cohorts are noticeably less alarmed only in Sweden, France, and Czechia. Geographically, Dutch, German, British, and Italian publics prove the most enthusiastic: the United Kingdom (UK) couples similar enthusiasm with markedly higher risk vigilance, whereas Czech and Swedish respondents remain consistently sceptical, underscoring a broad, though imperfect, west/south versus central/north divide. The Netherlands, Germany, the UK, and Italy value pro-social applications (i.e., realistic crisis drills, public-interest campaigns, and therapeutic ‘mental-health’ avatars), with the Netherlands topping four benefit items and Italy favouring commercial/entertainment uses such as virtual brand ambassadors. By contrast, Czech and Swedish respondents assign uniformly low benefit scores. Juxtaposed with risk perceptions, the UK and Czechia register the greatest vigilance, Sweden the most relaxed, and others intermediate. Divergence seems associated with digital literacy levels and regulatory maturity. The survey reveals a statistically and practically significant gap between perceived risks and benefits: across all seven countries, respondents, on average, rate risks higher than advantages. Regression estimates indicate that advancing age, lower household income, and gender (woman) enlarge this gap—primarily by undermining perceived benefits—whereas tertiary education and residence in certain western or southern European countries—notably, Germany and Italy—are associated with more balanced appraisals. This study concludes that layered governance, interoperable detection standards, and targeted literacy programmes are urgently required.}

Machine learning algorithms can augment or replace conventional approaches, improving transient behavior prediction, enabling precise fault diagnosis, and facilitating adaptive control strategies. This review paper examines current advancements in machine learning-based dynamic solid oxide fuel cells modeling, highlighting their integration with traditional methods. Key gaps identified include the scarcity of hybrid models that combine physical principles with data-driven models.

While scholars have highlighted the role of responsible AI in advancing responsible innovation, conceptualized as a transparent, reflexive, and inclusive process that engages all stakeholders, existing research has concentrated on initiatives at the AI design phase. As such, the processes through which responsible AI can be collaboratively implemented with external stakeholders to facilitate responsible innovation remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study employs a mixed-methods approach, comprising in-depth interviews (N = 26) and surveys (N = 618), to examine the relationship between responsible AI and responsible innovation. Drawing upon affordance–actualization theory, our findings reveal that responsible AI catalyzes three external stakeholder affordances: joint planning, joint problem-solving, and ethical climate. These affordances lead to immediate outcomes—stakeholder engagement and collective ethical efficacy—that ultimately foster responsible innovation. This study contributes to the literature on responsible AI by identifying three affordances related to the external stakeholders and one contextual factor, organizational mindfulness. It enriches the literature on responsible innovation by advancing the digital technology view and empirically examining the stepwise process through which responsible AI affects responsible innovation.}

Unfortunately, the reality is quite different, particularly when one considers public decision-making in urban areas. In other words, and according to Herbert Simon's well-known formula, no decision-maker can operate without a form of “bounded rationality”. This is one of the reasons why traditional Cost-Benefit Analysis received so many criticisms, and other decision-support techniques were developed with the intention of taking our limited rationality more directly into account (e.g. Multicriteria Decision Analysis and Problem Structuring Methods). However, now that rationality no longer seems inherently constrained thanks to the advent of Artificial Intelligence, it seems reasonable to assume that decision-making processes themselves may undergo significant changes. Specifically, the research question that this article addresses is this: “What contribution can AI make to overcoming the limitations of certain methodologies used to support public decision-making in urban contexts?”. This question will be addressed by critically examining one of the main techniques of evaluation, Cost-Benefit Analysis, with particular regard to the pragmatic dimension of choice.}

abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence (AI) within pathology and health care has advanced extensively. We have accordingly witnessed an increased adoption of various AI tools that are transforming our approach to clinical decision support, personalized medicine, predictive analytics, automation, and discovery. The familiar and more reliable AI tools that have been incorporated within health care thus far fall mostly under the nongenerative AI domain, which includes supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques. This review article explores how such nongenerative AI methods, rooted in traditional rules-based systems, enhance diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and consistency within medicine. Key concepts and the application of supervised learning models (ie, classification and regression) such as decision trees, support vector machines, linear and logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, and neural networks are explained along with the newer landscape of neural network-based nongenerative foundation models. Unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, are also discussed for their roles in uncovering novel disease subtypes or identifying outliers. Technical details related to the application of nongenerative AI algorithms for analyzing whole slide images are also highlighted. The performance, explainability, and reliability of nongenerative AI models essential for clinical decision-making is also reviewed, as well as challenges related to data quality, model interpretability, and risk of data drift. An understanding of which AI-ML models to employ and which shortcomings need to be addressed is imperative to safely and efficiently leverage, integrate, and monitor these traditional AI tools in clinical practice and research.}

abstract = {It has become clear that the need for huge datasets represents a bottleneck for applications of artificial intelligence classes. In pathology, there is the additional problem that there are often substantially fewer annotated target lesions than normal tissues for comparison. While deep learning algorithms have successfully tackled problems previously thought to be solely the domain of humans, this dependence on massive amounts of data is one of the major ways in which computer models of the brain are deficient. Organic brains utilize large numbers of specialized neural nets arranged in both linear and parallel fashion, with each solving a restricted classification problem. They rely on local error corrections such as Hebbian learning (“neurons that fire together wire together”) as compared to the nonlocal back-propagation used in most implementations of artificial neural nets. They incorporate reinforcement into their learning strategy. For these reasons, even toddlers can easily classify objects after one or only a few examples. Rather than provide an overview of current research articles on artificial intelligence in the pathology literature, this review will focus on general strategies for dealing with the huge datasets that we routinely encounter. These include transfer learning, zero-shot learning, Siamese networks, one-class models, generative networks, and reinforcement learning. Neither an extensive mathematical background nor advanced programming skills are needed in order to make these subjects accessible to pathologists with limited background in the nuts and bolts of machine learning. However, some familiarity with the basic principles of deep learning is necessary. In chapter 4 we provide a detailed description of these approaches. In this chapter we show how they are used to ameliorate training data needs. By providing an overview and extension of these concepts, this material will help to understand some of the current limitations of machine learning and how to address these. We begin with classical approaches and then move on to newer methodologies.}

abstract = {Introduction
Work-life balance is an increasing priority in healthcare. However, this presents a challenge for public hospitals, where shift work, weekend work and night shifts are essential to providing 24-h care. Self-rostering (SR) is a widely researched method that can increase work-life balance for health professionals. However, the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) is crucial to overcome the complexity of multi-department scheduling common in medical imaging departments. Guided by previous findings, this study explores work-life balance, shift-swapping and sick-leave in relation to AI-SR.
Methods
This research was undertaken alongside an AI-SR pilot, in two medical imaging departments (one urban, one regional) in Aotearoa, New Zealand (NZ). There were 71 participants, 81 % were female, all aged between 20 and 70. An explanatory-sequential mixed methods design was utilised. Data of shift-swaps, sick leave and work-life balance was collected, and thematic analysis was undertaken.
Results
Sick leave results varied between sites, linked qualitatively to improved staffing-levels and decreased work-life conflict, no change was noted in shift-swapping. Qualitative themes were agency, work fitting around life, fairness and loss aversion and receptivity.
Conclusion
AI-based self-rostering can help medical imaging staff balance work with their personal lives and may reduce sick leave, but more research is needed on its impact on wellbeing. Our findings also suggest that incorporating explainable AI could improve fairness and user acceptance, although guidance on XAI design for healthcare is scarce.
Implications for practice
Our study shows that AI-SR systems improve work-life balance. However, those looking to implement AI-SR systems should consider system transparency, to help mitigate loss aversion and improve perceptions of fairness. This is crucial to improving user understanding and, ultimately, acceptance of the scheduling approach and AI technologies more generally.}

The results suggest that AI significantly promotes the energy transition, and the promotion effect is greater in resource-based cities and central and eastern cities at the city level, as well as in strategic emerging industries and capital-intensive industries at the industry level. Regarding the influence mechanism, AI development can improve the energy transition by promoting green technology innovation and digital transformation. However, importantly, at higher levels of AI development, risks such as the energy rebound effect could arise.

The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) offers new opportunities for applications in emergency medicine, including patient triage. This study evaluates the performance of the Swiss Medical Assessment System (SMASS), an AI-based decision-support tool for rapid patient assessment, in comparison with the well-established Manchester Triage System (MTS).
Methods
In this retrospective analysis, patients aged 18 years or above presenting to the Department of Emergency Medicine at Kepler University Hospital in Linz, Austria, during November and December 2024 with non-traumatic complaints were included. Each patient underwent emergency triage using MTS, conducted by a registered nurse, with SMASS applied in parallel. SMASS had no influence on clinical decision-making.
Results
In the study period, 1021 patients were triaged with both MTS and SMASS. The mean patient age was 60 years (SD: 21), and 53 % were women. Of the patients categorized as “orange” by MTS, 19 % were classified as non-urgent by SMASS. Conversely, 28 % of the patients triaged as “green” by MTS were classified as urgent by SMASS. Additionally, 23 % of patients classified as non-urgent by SMASS required hospitalization following emergency department evaluation and treatment. Agreement between SMASS and MTS in triaging emergency patients was low as measured by a Cohen's kappa of 0.167.
Conclusions
In this study of patients presenting to a large tertiary-care emergency department, SMASS demonstrated considerable discrepancies in triage classification compared to MTS, with significant rates of both over- and undertriage. Further validation is necessary before integrating AI-based triage tools into routine clinical practice.}

abstract = {The rapid integration of intelligent processes and methods into information systems in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) era has led to a substantial shift towards autonomous software decision-making. This evolution necessitates robust human oversight, especially in critical domains like Healthcare, Education, and Energy. Human trust in AI plays a vital role in influencing decision-making processes of users interacting with AI. This paper presents VIRTSI (Variability and Impact of Reciprocal Trust States towards Intelligent systems), a novel rigorous computational model for human-AI Interaction. VIRTSI simulates human trust states, spanning from overtrust to distrust, through user modelling. It comprises: 1. A trust dynamics representational model based on Deterministic Finite State Automata (DFAs), illustrating transitions among cognitive trust states in response to AI-generated replies. 2. A trust evaluation model based on Confusion Matrices, originating from machine learning and Accuracy Metrics, providing a quantitative framework for analysing human trust dynamics. As a result, this is the first time that trust dynamics have been thoroughly traced in a representational model and a method has been developed to assess the impact of possibly harmful states like overtrust and distrust. An empirical study on the recently launched Large Language Model of generative AI, ChatGPT (version 3.5), provides a radical underexplored AI-generated platform for evaluating the human-AI interaction through VIRTSI. The study involved 1200 interactions of real users as well as AI experts together with experts in two very different domains of evaluation, namely software engineering and poetry. This study traces trust dynamics and the emerging human-AI interaction, in concrete examples of real user synergies with generative AI. The research reveals the vital role of maintaining normal trust states for optimal human-AI interaction and that both AI and human users need further steps towards this goal. The real-world implications of this research can guide the creation and evaluation of user interfaces with AI and the incorporation of functionalities in the development of generative AI chatbots in terms of trust by providing a new rigorous DFA representational method of trust dynamics and a corresponding new perspective of confusion matrix evaluation method of the dynamics’ impact in the efficiency of human-AI dialogues.}

The concept of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a burgeoning field focused on elucidating the opaque nature of deep learning systems by evaluating these models and providing insights into their decision-making processes. Due to their inherent lack of transparency, deep learning models often fall short of explicitly articulating the rationale behind their predictions. Consequently, integrating most deep learning algorithms into real-world clinical decision-making workflows remains limited. Our review paper presents a comprehensive analysis of XAI techniques in the context of medical imaging analysis. Through a systematic review of existing literature, we offer insights into the comparative landscape of XAI approaches, meticulously evaluating prominent medical imaging datasets and identifying gaps in prior research. We provide a concise overview of state-of-the-art interpretable models and post-hoc methods, accompanied by an assessment of suitable evaluation metrics for benchmarking these approaches. Additionally, we introduce a taxonomy for categorizing XAI methods, encompassing visual, textual, example-based, and concept-based approaches. Our discussion extends to future research directions and challenges, aiming to guide the development of innovative solutions in this rapidly evolving field.}

The methodology is divided into two phases: Phase 1 covers data collection, preprocessing, and augmentation using Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) to expand the curated dataset of 1189 soil images to 8,413, while Phase 2 focuses on training CNN and ViT models, ensembling these models, and developing a fuzzy logic system that considers soil type, nutrients, potential of hydrogen (pH), and climatic conditions for crop recommendations. Experimental results indicate models achieve classification accuracies of up to 89.32 % on the original dataset, improving to 91.01 % with augmented data. On the CycleGAN-augmented (CyAUG) dataset, EfficientNet v2 Large and ViT-Large/16 attain accuracies of 99.60 % and 99.73 %, respectively. Furthermore, an ensemble of these architectures achieves a perfect accuracy of 100 %. The results are also validated by K-fold cross-validation. The research also presents 'Agro Companion,' an AI-powered tool that assists farmers in soil identification and crop selection based on geological and environmental data. This framework addresses key agricultural challenges in India, offering a high-accuracy, practical solution for improving both soil classification and crop recommendation. This research delivers state-of-the-art soil classification performance and a robust AI-based crop recommendation tool to support sustainable agricultural practices.}

abstract = {Background
The conceptual definition of epilepsy has been changing over decades and remains debatable. We assessed how artificial intelligence (AI) conceives epilepsy and its impact on a person’s life through verbal and visual material.
Methods
We asked the Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT, OpenAI) to define epilepsy and its impact. Prompts from ChatGPT were transferred to another AI tool DALL·E 2 (Open AI) to generate visual images based on verbal input.
Results
The ChatGPT definition on epilepsy relied on both its conceptual and practical definitions. It titled epilepsy to be “a neurological disorder characterized by recurring seizures” that has significant impact on patients’ lives and is diagnosed after two or more unprovoked seizures or if there is a high risk of future seizures. ChatGPT presented nine issues – seizure-related injuries, limitations on daily activities, emotional and psychological impact, social stigma and isolation, educational and employment challenges, relationship and family dynamics, medication side effects, financial burden, and coexisting conditions – as major consequences of epilepsy. AI-generated images ranged from direct portrayals of these phenomena to abstract imagery but were mostly deprived of symbolic elements and visual metaphors.
Conclusion
We showed that AI can identify and visually interpret the burden of epilepsy from medical, societal and economical perspectives. However, the imagery created is not figurative and does not follow allegorical narratives put forward by epilepsy specialists in similar studies. The ability of AI models to lead an in-depth discussion on epilepsy remains questionable and should be explored with more advanced AI tools.}

abstract = {With the development of artificial intelligence, there has been a wave of innovation in the field of music creation and performance. In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial network architecture, which can generate adaptive piano accompaniment in real time. In the network, the generator generates piano accompaniment based on the input melody, and the discriminator evaluates the quality difference between the generated accompaniment and the professional accompaniment, and improves the quality of the accompaniment through the adversarial learning mechanism. The network design focuses on harmonizing the accompaniment with the main melody, introduces music theory knowledge constraints such as harmonic acoustic principles, and uses recurrent neural networks to capture the temporal characteristics of music, so that the rhythm and dynamics of the accompaniment change synchronously with the main melody. To validate the model, we collected piano repertoire of different styles and conducted extensive experiments. The results show that the generative adversarial network has good adaptability, can automatically adjust the accompaniment style and complexity according to the melody characteristics, and the generation speed is up to 5 s per song, and the adaptability is up to 90 %, which is significantly better than the traditional method. User studies have shown that this network-generated accompaniment is audibly indistinguishable from that performed by a professional pianist, highlighting its potential for practical applications.}

Through Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, we investigate relationships between technology impact awareness, job insecurity, proactive personality, and active learning intention. Results reveal a “technology impact-job insecurity decoupling effect”: technology awareness directly motivates learning (β = 0.519, p < 0.001) without triggering job insecurity as mediator. While job insecurity positively influences learning intention (β = 0.338, p < 0.001), it does not mediate the technology-learning relationship. Proactive personality moderates the insecurity-learning link (β = 0.132, p < 0.001). To explain this decoupling, we propose an “art-technology cognitive separation” mechanism whereby music teachers perceive AI as an auxiliary tool enhancing rather than threatening their artistic core. These finding challenges traditional assumptions that technological threats necessarily induce occupational anxiety before motivating adaptation. The study extends COR theory to creative professions and suggests institutions should focus on increasing AI awareness through opportunity-framed exposure rather than threat-based messaging, while tailoring support strategies to teachers' personality traits.}

OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) functions as a high-resolution non-invasive imaging technology that serves multiple applications within ophthalmology and cardiology and dermatology as well as oncology. The adoption of OCT technology showed major diagnostic progress but medical professionals still face obstacles in complex picture interpretation as well as inconsistent accuracy rates. The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that use machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) functions has enabled OCT to analyze images automatically while offering better diagnostic precision.
Methods
The study investigates medical sector applications of OCT technology and scrutinizes how AI facilitates improved clinical performance of OCT. Research conducted on peer-reviewed studies analyzed how AI improves OCT technology by enabling automatic disease detection and real-time image modification and clinical support functions.
Results
The medical field underwent a revolutionary change due to OCT technology that enables improved detection of diseases alongside better patient healing outcomes for retinal conditions and cardiovascular problems and epithelial cancer cases. Real-time surgical oncology decision-making occurs through AI by improving both OCT classification of diseases and detection of tumor margins simultaneously. Convolutional neural networks under artificial intelligence control exhibit strong ability to detect normal and abnormal tissues thus enabling earlier cancer detection with improved medical treatment accuracy. Solving active problems with two main issues stands as the key requirement for progress as clinicians work with uncertain model validity and incomplete dataset similarities in clinical settings.
Conclusions
Clinical procedures benefit from important improvements when OCT networks integrate AI command systems in their operations. Future research demands model optimization for AI technology together with the solution of dataset biases and better implementation in medical settings. AI integration with OCT technology points to substantial potential for healthcare detection developments as well as treatment solutions for individual patients in cancer medicine.}

At one end are diseases that are complex and heterogeneous affecting millions, while at the other there are monogenic and rare diseases, with a handful of individuals. What are absent are drugs that can treat or cure the disease. Discovering these is challenging, held back by extreme costs to develop them or in some cases by the limited understanding of the diseases. After decades of drug discovery research there is now considerable data available which can be used to help develop novel compounds more strategically. This includes high throughput screening data with targets, crystal structures of proteins implicated in neurological diseases and adjacent data such as properties of molecules like blood brain barrier permeability as well as an array of in vitro and in vivo toxicity endpoints valuable for any drug targeting the central nervous system. While computational tools have been developing and applied to neurological diseases for decades, we are now in the age of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). This promises the potential to expedite the identification and discovery of new molecules. Whether by using individual computational techniques or complex end-to-end approaches, scientists can narrow the molecules they make and test as well as study more targets or diseases which might have been out of reach previously. This review highlights the many different applications of AI potentially enabling new discoveries and treatments for neurological diseases.}

abstract = {Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for future wireless networks, aiming to improve communication efficiency by transmitting only the semantic meaning (or its encoded version) of the source data rather than the complete set of bits (symbols). However, traditional deep learning-based SemCom systems present challenges such as limited generalization, low robustness, and inadequate reasoning capabilities, primarily due to the inherently discriminative nature of deep neural networks. To address these limitations, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is seen as a promising solution, offering notable advantages in learning complex data distributions, transforming data between high- and low-dimensional spaces, and generating high-quality content. This paper explores the applications of GAI in SemCom and presents a comprehensive study. It begins by introducing three widely used SemCom systems enabled by classical GAI models: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. For each system, the fundamental concept of the GAI model, the corresponding SemCom architecture, and a literature review of recent developments are provided. Subsequently, a novel generative SemCom system is proposed, incorporating cutting-edge GAI technology—large language models (LLMs). This system features LLM-based artificial intelligence (AI) agents at both the transmitter and receiver, which act as “brains” to enable advanced information understanding and content regeneration capabilities, respectively. Unlike traditional systems that focus on bitstream recovery, this design allows the receiver to directly generate the desired content from the coded semantic information sent by the transmitter. As a result, the communication paradigm shifts from “information recovery” to “information regeneration,” marking a new era in generative SemCom. A case study on point-to-point video retrieval is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, showing a 99.98% reduction in communication overhead and a 53% improvement in average retrieval accuracy compared to traditional communication systems. Furthermore, four typical application scenarios for generative SemCom are described, followed by a discussion of three open issues for future research. In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive set of guidelines for applying GAI in SemCom, laying the groundwork for the efficient deployment of generative SemCom in future wireless networks.}

Utilizing an unbalanced panel dataset of 3853 firms from 2010 to 2023, the study employs a two-way fixed effects model to analyze financial and environmental social responsibility performance. The findings demonstrate that AI significantly improves financial performance and environmental social responsibility, thereby enhancing overall sustainable development performance. This conclusion is robust across various endogeneity and robustness tests, including lagged core explanatory variables, instrumental variable methods, Heckman tests, DID tests, elimination of extreme observations, exclusion of abnormal year samples, substitution of core explanatory variables, and unrelated industry regression. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the positive impact of AI on sustainable development performance is more pronounced in the eastern region and among non-state-owned firms. Mechanism analysis reveals that AI enhances financial performance and sustainability through total factor productivity (TFP) and increased average wages, although it has a negative impact on environmental social responsibility performance. Based on these results, the study provides policymakers and business managers with relevant recommendations for leveraging AI to promote sustainable business development. This research is the first to comprehensively explore the impact of AI on the sustainability performance of international trading firms within a unified framework, thereby expanding the existing literature and offering valuable insights for both policymakers and practitioners.}

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into education has the potential to transform learning experiences, particularly in nursing. Understanding students' perceptions of AI and its impact on psychological factors, such as self-efficacy and psychological distress, is crucial for effective implementation.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that influence nursing students' perceptions of AI, psychological distress, and self-efficacy.
Design
A cross-sectional study design was used.
Participants and setting
This study was conducted using a convenience sample of 108 nursing students from a public university in Saudi Arabia.
Methods
Three instruments were used: The Perceptions of AI, Kessler Psychological Distress, and Self-Efficacy scales. Data were analyzed using independent sample t-tests, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, and multiple linear regression.
Results
The study found that participants who used AI displayed significant differences in their self-efficacy. Additionally, notable associations were found between perceptions of AI, self-efficacy, and psychological distress. However, while the regression models were significant, the perceptions of AI did not meaningfully explain the variance in these outcomes (p > 0.05).
Conclusions
This study highlights the significance of addressing students' perceptions of AI to improve their educational experiences and mental well-being. Future research should explore the longitudinal impact of mental health interventions in technology-driven learning environments.}

Key applications are discussed, including the use of advanced ML algorithms, such as support vector machines, random forests, and deep learning techniques, in quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict chemical toxicity based on molecular structures. The chapter also examines how AI enhances environmental monitoring through the analysis of data from satellites, drones, and sensor networks to detect pollution events and assess ecosystem health. Advanced AI techniques like transfer learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) are presented as solutions to challenges such as limited labeled datasets and data scarcity. The importance of explainable AI is highlighted to ensure transparency and trust in model predictions, which is crucial for regulatory acceptance. Current challenges, including data quality issues, model interpretability, computational demands, integration of diverse data types, and ethical considerations, are thoroughly examined. The chapter proposes future directions to overcome these obstacles, such as enhancing data quality through standardized protocols, improving model interpretability with advanced explainable AI techniques, leveraging transfer and federated learning, integrating multiomics data, incorporating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and addressing ethical and legal issues.

abstract = {Background
The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, has added complexity and richness to the virtual environment by increasing the presence of AI-generated content (AIGC). Although social media platforms such as TikTok have begun labeling AIGC to facilitate the ability for users to distinguish it from human-generated content, little research has been performed to examine the effect of these AIGC labels.
Objective
This study investigated the impact of AIGC labels on perceived accuracy, message credibility, and sharing intention for misinformation through a web-based experimental design, aiming to refine the strategic application of AIGC labels.
Methods
The study conducted a 2×2×2 mixed experimental design, using the AIGC labels (presence vs absence) as the between-subjects factor and information type (accurate vs inaccurate) and content category (for-profit vs not-for-profit) as within-subjects factors. Participants, recruited via the Credamo platform, were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (with labels) or a control group (without labels). Each participant evaluated 4 sets of content, providing feedback on perceived accuracy, message credibility, and sharing intention for misinformation. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 29 and included repeated-measures ANOVA and simple effects analysis, with significance set at P<.05.
Results
As of April 2024, this study recruited a total of 957 participants, and after screening, 400 participants each were allocated to the experimental and control groups. The main effects of AIGC labels were not significant for perceived accuracy, message credibility, or sharing intention. However, the main effects of information type were significant for all 3 dependent variables (P<.001), as were the effects of content category (P<.001). There were significant differences in interaction effects among the 3 variables. For perceived accuracy, the interaction between information type and content category was significant (P=.005). For message credibility, the interaction between information type and content category was significant (P<.001). Regarding sharing intention, both the interaction between information type and content category (P<.001) and the interaction between information type and AIGC labels (P=.008) were significant.
Conclusions
This study found that AIGC labels minimally affect perceived accuracy, message credibility, or sharing intention but help distinguish AIGC from human-generated content. The labels do not negatively impact users’ perceptions of platform content, indicating their potential for fact-checking and governance. However, AIGC labeling applications should vary by information type; they can slightly enhance sharing intention and perceived accuracy for misinformation. This highlights the need for more nuanced strategies for AIGC labels, necessitating further research.}

Anthropomorphic appearance of AI opponents was also manipulated to determine whether visual appearance also contributes to response behavior. Results indicated that participants treated AI agents identically to humans, and not as non-intelligent (e.g., random number generator-based) systems. This was manifested in both how they responded to offers from the AI system, and also how fairly they subsequently treated the AI opponent. The current results suggest that humans treat AI systems very similarly to other humans, and not as privileged decision makers, which has both positive and negative implications for human-autonomy teaming.}

The focus on food quality has heightened, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strict standards throughout the food processing chain. This chapter highlights AI's role at critical points of quality control in the production line, such as raw material assessments, processing, final product inspections, and packaging, with an emphasis on AI's potential to ensure compliance with quality benchmarks. AI's applications in food quality maintenance include the use of machine learning and computer vision for automated quality checks of raw materials, real-time monitoring during processing, and consistent evaluations of finished products to detect anomalies. Furthermore, AI-driven insights can enhance packaging integrity by identifying defects and predicting shelf life, thus supporting a more efficient and reliable production system. As the food industry continues to embrace AI innovations, these advancements promise to transform quality control processes, ensuring improved safety, compliance, and operational efficiency worldwide. Focusing on quality rather than quantity in production enhances overall product performance. Here, AI plays a crucial role by accurately assessing demand to meet the right quantity of food products needed, minimizing waste while ensuring quality. Food waste, costing over $1 trillion yearly, significantly impacts both global hunger and environmental sustainability, with UNEP reporting 1.05 billion tons of food wasted in 2022 alone. AI-driven demand forecasting offers a solution by addressing food industry complexities in data temporality, output measures, and predictive variables, crucial for managing perishable items. Advanced algorithms like random forest and long short-term memory (LSTM) improve forecasting accuracy, reducing waste by up to 52% and unmet demand by 16%. As generative AI and large language models evolve, they can refine demand predictions, minimizing waste and enhancing efficiency, profitability, and sustainability in the food sector.}

This study investigates the application of ChatGPT-4 in extracting and classifying behavioral data from scientific literature, focusing on the daily time-activity budget of dairy cows. Accurate analysis of time-activity budgets is crucial for understanding dairy cow welfare and productivity. Traditional methods are time-intensive and prone to bias. This study evaluates the accuracy and reliability of ChatGPT-4 in data extraction and data categorization, considering explicit, inferred, and ambiguous labels for the data, compared with human analysis. A collection of 55 papers on dairy cow behavior were used in the studies. Data extraction for eating, ruminating, and lying behaviors was performed manually and via ChatGPT-4. The artificial intelligence (AI) model's accuracy and labeling performance were assessed through descriptive and statistical analyses. Mixed model analysis was used to compare human and AI outcomes. Artificial intelligence and human time budget data showed significant differences for eating and ruminating but not for lying. ChatGPT-4 estimated daily eating time at 22.3% compared with 23.8% by humans. For ruminating, AI reported 33.4% against 31.7% by humans. Daily lying times were nearly identical, with AI at 44.4% and human analysis at 44.2%. The global accuracy in data extraction was ∼75%, and labeling accuracy reached 67.3%, with significant variability across behavioral categories. In general, the AI model demonstrates moderate accuracy in extracting and categorizing behavioral data, particularly for inferred and ambiguous data. However, explicit data extraction posed challenges, highlighting AI's dependence on input quality and structure. The consistency between AI and human analyses for lying behavior underscores AI's potential for specific applications. ChatGPT-4 offers a promising complementary tool for behavioral research, enabling efficient and scalable data extraction. However, improvements in AI algorithms and standardized reporting in scientific literature are essential for broader applicability. The study advocates for hybrid approaches combining AI capabilities with human oversight to enhance the reliability and accuracy of dairy cow behavioral research.}

Background
Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and deep learning (including generative AI) are increasingly being investigated in the context of research and management of human infection.
Objectives
We summarise recent and potential future applications of AI and its relevance to clinical infection practice.
Methods
1617 PubMed results were screened, with priority given to clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This narrative review focusses on studies using prospectively collected real-world data with clinical validation, and on research with translational potential, such as novel drug discovery and microbiome-based interventions.
Results
There is some evidence of clinical utility of AI applied to laboratory diagnostics (e.g. digital culture plate reading, malaria diagnosis, antimicrobial resistance profiling), clinical imaging analysis (e.g. pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosis), clinical decision support tools (e.g. sepsis prediction, antimicrobial prescribing) and public health outbreak management (e.g. COVID-19). Most studies to date lack any real-world validation or clinical utility metrics. Significant heterogeneity in study design and reporting limits comparability. Many practical and ethical issues exist, including algorithm transparency and risk of bias.
Conclusions
Interest in and development of AI-based tools for infection research and management are undoubtedly gaining pace, although the real-world clinical utility to date appears much more modest.}

abstract = {Understanding of complex biological systems remains a significant challenge due to their high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and context-specific behavior. Artificial intelligence (AI) and mechanistic modeling are becoming essential tools for studying such complex systems. Mechanistic modeling can facilitate the construction of simulatable models that are interpretable but often struggle with scalability and parameters estimation. AI can integrate multi-omics data to create predictive models, but it lacks interpretability. The gap between these two modeling methods limits our ability to develop comprehensive and predictive models for biomedical applications. This article reviews the most recent advancements in the integration of AI and mechanistic modeling to fill this gap. Recently, with omics availability, AI has led to new discoveries in mechanistic computational modeling. The mechanistic models can also help in getting insight into the mechanism for prediction made by AI models. This integration is helpful in modeling complex systems, estimating the parameters that are hard to capture in experiments, and creating surrogate models to reduce computational costs because of expensive mechanistic model simulations. This article focuses on advancements in mechanistic computational models and AI models and their integration for scientific discoveries in biology, pharmacology, drug discovery and diseases. The mechanistic models with AI integration can facilitate biological discoveries to advance our understanding of disease mechanisms, drug development, and personalized medicine. The article also highlights the role of AI and mechanistic model integration in the development of more advanced models in the biomedical domain, such as medical digital twins and virtual patients for pharmacological discoveries.}

This article will focus on three ways in which generative AI is expected to change marketing. First, generative AI enables companies to automatically create advertising copy and images, potentially leading to significant cost reductions. Secondly, generative AI offers possibilities to improve and automate personalised marketing, potentially enabling companies to send the right persuasive message at the right time to each potential customer. Thirdly, generative AI potentially offers possibilities to market products to consumers via generative AI chatbots. These developments offer potential advantages but also bear risks for consumers. For example, deepfakes in advertising can mislead consumers, AI-generated personalised marketing can exploit consumer vulnerabilities, and B2C chatbots can deceive consumers by providing biased advice. This article shows that EU law does in principle provide protection to consumers in relation to AI-generated marketing, but is also likely to fall short in effectively protecting consumers against the identified risks in several ways.}

Previous studies reported the impact of vegetation on flow dynamics without providing a precise prediction of flood energy reduction. Therefore, the present study utilized a hybrid artificial intelligence model for the accurate prediction of flood energy reduction. Data series including the hydraulic and geometric conditions of vegetation were collected from the existing literature. Hybrid models, including artificial neural networks, extreme gradient boosting, and support vector regression with Particle Swarm Optimization and random forest, were used. The performance of each artificial intelligence model was evaluated considering the correlation coefficient and mean square error. The result demonstrated superior performance of the extreme gradient boosting with Particle Swarm Optimization model with correlation coefficient and mean square error values of 0.88 and 7.01, respectively. In contrast, an artificial neural network with Particle Swarm Optimization has less predictive power, with correlation coefficient and mean square error values of 0.83 and 7.89. The superior performance of the best model was also confirmed through Analysis of Variance and T-test with P-values of 0.0054 and 0.0062. Furthermore, the best performance of the extreme gradient boosting with Particle Swarm Optimization model was also achieved utilizing Taylor's diagram, in which predicted standard deviation (13.75) matched with measured standard deviation (13.98) compared to other models. The findings of the current research provide insight into the significance of hybrid models, especially the extreme gradient boosting with Particle Swarm Optimization model, while predicting flood energy reduction through vegetation.}

To address the shortcomings of previously established methodologies, this research proposes a unique Artificial Intelligence driven sensor-based methodology that utilizes the SisFall dataset in conjunction with a Recurrent Neural Network - Long Short-Term Memory model. Two methods were considered: one using a Butterworth filter and the other without filtering. The results emphasize the significance of noise reduction in enhancing model performance. Additionally, the integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques brings transparency and interpretability to the model’s predictions, enhancing its dependability and trustworthiness in healthcare applications. Using Artificial Intelligence driven fall detection with Explainable Artificial Intelligence for transparent decision-making, this methodology presents a robust approach to improving accuracy and reducing false alarms in real-world healthcare settings. The study demonstrates that combining advanced filtering techniques with Explainable Artificial Intelligence algorithms successfully overcomes the challenges associated with traditional fall detection systems. The findings further confirm that the application of an Artificial Intelligence based Butterworth filter significantly enhances model accuracy, achieving 98.96% compared to 79.77% without filtering.

Empirical assessments of theoretical hypotheses were conducted utilizing survey data gathered from 717 executives across global firms. We found strong evidence that internal innovation resources (IIR) and collaborative innovation networks (CIN) have a positive impact on firm's AI orientation. The study revealed that environmental uncertainty (EU) can negatively moderate the relationship between internal innovation resources, collaborative innovation networks, and AI orientation. A positive moderating effect was observed between corporate digital culture (DC) and the relationship between internal innovation resources, collaborative innovation networks, and AI orientation. Meanwhile, we found a positive moderating effect of Executives' Not-Invented-Here Syndrome (NIHS) on the relationship between internal innovation resources and AI orientation.

abstract = {Purpose
The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is rapidly evolving, with potential to improve both the clinician and patient experience. We sought to evaluate whether popular AI text-to-image generators could create anatomically accurate images of common hand surgery procedures. We hypothesized that the AI-generated images would not be adequate as patient education materials.
Methods
We queried five AI text-to-image generators: Craiyon, DALL-E, DeepSeek, Gemini, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. They were given the prompt, “Create an anatomically accurate image with labels of [Condition] surgical approach to be used as a visual aid for patient education,” with the following conditions inserted: carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren contracture, trigger finger, thumb carpometacarpal arthritis, and de Quervain tenosynovitis. Images were then graded on legibility, detail and clarity, anatomical realism and accuracy, appropriate surgical site, and lack of fabricated anatomy. Images could score a maximum of 2 points per each criterion, with an assumed Control score of 10 points.
Results
A total of 1,500 images were generated and reviewed. When comparing total scores, all AI generators performed significantly lower than the Control, except for DALL-E’s images of Dupuytren contracture. For the image detail and clarity category, DALL-E, DeepSeek, Gemini, and Midjourney all scored similarly to the Control and each other. For the remaining criteria (legibility, anatomic realism, surgical site, fabricated anatomy), each of the AI generators scored significantly lower than the Control generator. In total, 99.8% of images contained at least some degree of fabricated anatomy. DALL-E consistently had the highest scores for each category, while Craiyon had the lowest.
Conclusions
Although the AI servers successfully produced highly detailed and visually engaging images, they failed to portray accurate anatomy and often included fictitious structures. Further work is needed to train and fine tune AI models to produce accurate and appropriate images.
