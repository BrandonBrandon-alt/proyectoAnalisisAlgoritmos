abstract = {Objective
To evaluate demographic representation in artificial intelligence (AI)–generated images of hospital leadership roles and compare them with real-world data from US hospitals.
Patients and Methods
This cross-sectional study, conducted from October 1, 2024 to October 31, 2024, analyzed images generated by 3 AI text-to-image models: Midjourney 6.0, OpenAI ChatGPT DALL-E 3, and Google Gemini Imagen 3. Standardized prompts were used to create 1200 images representing 4 key leadership roles: chief executive officers, chief medical officers, chief nursing officers, and chief financial officers. Real-world demographic data from 4397 US hospitals showed that chief executive officers were 73.2% men; chief financial officers, 65.2% men; chief medical officers, 85.7% men; and chief nursing officers, 9.4% men (overall: 60.1% men). The primary outcome was gender representation, with secondary outcomes including race/ethnicity and age. Two independent reviewers assessed images, with interrater reliability evaluated using Cohen κ.
Results
Interrater agreement was high for gender (κ=0.998) and moderate for race/ethnicity (κ=0.670) and age (κ=0.605). DALL-E overrepresented men (86.5%) and White individuals (94.5%). Midjourney showed improved gender balance (69.5% men) but overrepresented White individuals (75.0%). Imagen achieved near gender parity (50.3% men) but remained predominantly White (51.5%). Statistically significant differences were observed across models and between models and real-world demographics.
Conclusion
Artificial intelligence text-to-image models reflect and amplify systemic biases, overrepresenting men and White leaders, while underrepresenting diversity. Ethical AI practices, including diverse training data sets and fairness-aware algorithms, are essential to ensure equitable representation in health care leadership.}

This review critically examines recent advancements in the application of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence for optimizing thermal energy systems, including solar collectors, heat exchangers, and latent heat storage units. Nanotechnology (particularly the use of nano-enhanced phase change materials and nanofluids such as Al₂O₃ and CuO) has shown to improve thermal conductivity by up to 28.8 %, accelerating energy absorption and storage rates. Concurrently, artificial intelligence algorithms, especially artificial neural networks and particle swarm optimization, enable predictive modelling, real-time system control, and fault detection, with some models achieving prediction accuracies above 97 % under complex operational conditions. The review emphasizes the synergistic potential of combining these technologies to create intelligent, self-regulating thermal energy systems. However, the paper also identifies critical challenges including computational overhead, cost of nanoparticle synthesis, lack of reproducibility in artificial intelligence implementations, and insufficient validation under extreme scenarios. Commercial deployment case studies (such as artificial intelligence-driven phase change material-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in smart buildings) are discussed to illustrate practical viability, reporting energy savings of up to 28 % with return-on-investment periods under three years. The paper concludes by proposing integrated research directions that combine multiscale material innovation with robust artificial intelligence training on dynamic datasets. This dual approach is essential to developing scalable, cost-effective, and resilient thermal energy systems capable of supporting global energy transitions.}

The combination of these two artificial intelligence approaches, referred to as GAN-RL, presents a powerful synergy that leverages their strengths while addressing their respective limitations. This paper provides the first comprehensive review that systematically examines GAN-RL, offering an in-depth analysis of its theoretical foundations, key methodologies, and diverse applications. Specifically, we categorize GAN-RL approaches based on five primary objectives: (a) generating comprehensive synthetic datasets for training; (b) minimizing the discrepancies between value (or cumulative reward) distributions, where the cumulative reward is defined as the total sum of rewards an agent accumulates over the course of its interactions with the environment; (c) predicting the next scenario; (d) predicting the gradient of the generator in discrete tasks; and (e) learning from demonstrations. Our analysis highlights how GAN-RL enhances system performance, including improvements in cumulative reward, convergence rate, and prediction accuracy.

A framework is proposed for design and assessment of enabling technologies for workplace learning. In applying it to ChatGPT, as paradigm of conversational agents, we find the aspects that are particularly suitable to enhance workplace learning, and those that need further development.
Originality/value
The theoretical approach is novel. Previous research is based on reported use-cases of enabling technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), in the workplace or on the analysis of the learner’s experience when these technologies are embedded in structured training modules. The present study addresses the limitations of current retrospective research, providing a forward-looking approach.}

This review article explores how such nongenerative AI methods, rooted in traditional rules-based systems, enhance diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and consistency within medicine. Key concepts and the application of supervised learning models (ie, classification and regression) such as decision trees, support vector machines, linear and logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, and neural networks are explained along with the newer landscape of neural network-based nongenerative foundation models. Unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, are also discussed for their roles in uncovering novel disease subtypes or identifying outliers. Technical details related to the application of nongenerative AI algorithms for analyzing whole slide images are also highlighted. The performance, explainability, and reliability of nongenerative AI models essential for clinical decision-making is also reviewed, as well as challenges related to data quality, model interpretability, and risk of data drift. An understanding of which AI-ML models to employ and which shortcomings need to be addressed is imperative to safely and efficiently leverage, integrate, and monitor these traditional AI tools in clinical practice and research.}

abstract = {Introduction
Work-life balance is an increasing priority in healthcare. However, this presents a challenge for public hospitals, where shift work, weekend work and night shifts are essential to providing 24-h care. Self-rostering (SR) is a widely researched method that can increase work-life balance for health professionals. However, the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) is crucial to overcome the complexity of multi-department scheduling common in medical imaging departments. Guided by previous findings, this study explores work-life balance, shift-swapping and sick-leave in relation to AI-SR.
Methods
This research was undertaken alongside an AI-SR pilot, in two medical imaging departments (one urban, one regional) in Aotearoa, New Zealand (NZ). There were 71 participants, 81 % were female, all aged between 20 and 70. An explanatory-sequential mixed methods design was utilised. Data of shift-swaps, sick leave and work-life balance was collected, and thematic analysis was undertaken.
Results
Sick leave results varied between sites, linked qualitatively to improved staffing-levels and decreased work-life conflict, no change was noted in shift-swapping. Qualitative themes were agency, work fitting around life, fairness and loss aversion and receptivity.
Conclusion
AI-based self-rostering can help medical imaging staff balance work with their personal lives and may reduce sick leave, but more research is needed on its impact on wellbeing. Our findings also suggest that incorporating explainable AI could improve fairness and user acceptance, although guidance on XAI design for healthcare is scarce.
Implications for practice
Our study shows that AI-SR systems improve work-life balance. However, those looking to implement AI-SR systems should consider system transparency, to help mitigate loss aversion and improve perceptions of fairness. This is crucial to improving user understanding and, ultimately, acceptance of the scheduling approach and AI technologies more generally.}

It identifies the persistent factors that contributed to an accountability gap when AI systems were previously used for judicial decision-making. To address these risks, the paper analyses the relevant provisions of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, outlining a comprehensive accountability framework based on the regulation's risk-based approach.

Drawing on the job demands-resources (JD-R) model and social cognitive theory, we propose a conceptual framework in which the GenAI intensity of adoption mediates the relationship between employees’ attitudes toward the technology and their well-being. By analyzing survey data from approximately 130 knowledge workers and analyzing it through partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), our findings reveal that a positive attitude toward GenAI significantly enhances its adoption, whereas a negative attitude does not necessarily prevent usage. Furthermore, the extent of GenAI adoption influences all three dimensions of well-being, with team cohesion acting as a mediating factor. These results contribute to the literature on workplace well-being and technology adoption by offering theoretical and managerial insights into the complex relationship between AI integration and employee experience.}

In addition to this, Artificial Intelligence is applied in a wide variety of applications like healthcare sector, content creation and entertainment and financial industries. Therefore, this work finds the efficiency of Artificial Intelligence -oriented cybersecurity metrics in succeeding the digital environment over elevating cyber threats. Here, the developed models consist of two different stages while implementing the model. In the first stage, the essential dataset is assembled from the benchmark data source. These datasets are assembled by using Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen Artificial Intelligence networks). Consequently, the raw data is given as an input to Conditional Hybrid Network for cybersecurity enhancement. Further, the Transformer-based Conditional Variational Autoencoders with Spatial-temporal Attention are designed for feature extraction that is subjected to the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for classifying the cyber attacks. Henceforth, the developed network is evaluated and designed with multiple measures. Comparing baseline models, the suggested network obtains higher performance for developing security over cyber networks.}

The process requires human creativity, ingenuity and in-depth knowledge of formulation development and processing optimization, which can be time-consuming. Herein, we tested the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to create de novo formulations for three-dimensional (3D) printing. Specifically, conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), which are generative models known for their creativity, were trained on a dataset consisting of 1437 fused deposition modelling (FDM) printed formulations that were extracted from both the literature and in-house data. In total, 27 different cGANs architectures were explored with varying learning rate, batch size and number of hidden layers parameters to generate 270 formulations. After a comparison between the characteristics of AI-generated and human-generated formulations, it was discovered that cGANs with a medium learning rate (10−4) could strike a balance in generating formulations that are both novel and realistic. Four of these formulations were fabricated using an FDM printer, of which the first AI-generated formulation was successfully printed. Our study represents a milestone, highlighting the capacity of AI to undertake creative tasks and its potential to revolutionize the drug development process.}

The concept of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a burgeoning field focused on elucidating the opaque nature of deep learning systems by evaluating these models and providing insights into their decision-making processes. Due to their inherent lack of transparency, deep learning models often fall short of explicitly articulating the rationale behind their predictions. Consequently, integrating most deep learning algorithms into real-world clinical decision-making workflows remains limited. Our review paper presents a comprehensive analysis of XAI techniques in the context of medical imaging analysis. Through a systematic review of existing literature, we offer insights into the comparative landscape of XAI approaches, meticulously evaluating prominent medical imaging datasets and identifying gaps in prior research. We provide a concise overview of state-of-the-art interpretable models and post-hoc methods, accompanied by an assessment of suitable evaluation metrics for benchmarking these approaches. Additionally, we introduce a taxonomy for categorizing XAI methods, encompassing visual, textual, example-based, and concept-based approaches.

While existing research typically addresses soil classification or crop recommendation in isolation, this work integrates cutting-edge deep learning models and fuzzy logic to enhance both tasks. The methodology is divided into two phases: Phase 1 covers data collection, preprocessing, and augmentation using Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) to expand the curated dataset of 1189 soil images to 8,413, while Phase 2 focuses on training CNN and ViT models, ensembling these models, and developing a fuzzy logic system that considers soil type, nutrients, potential of hydrogen (pH), and climatic conditions for crop recommendations. Experimental results indicate models achieve classification accuracies of up to 89.32 % on the original dataset, improving to 91.01 % with augmented data. On the CycleGAN-augmented (CyAUG) dataset, EfficientNet v2 Large and ViT-Large/16 attain accuracies of 99.60 % and 99.73 %, respectively. Furthermore, an ensemble of these architectures achieves a perfect accuracy of 100 %. The results are also validated by K-fold cross-validation. The research also presents 'Agro Companion,' an AI-powered tool that assists farmers in soil identification and crop selection based on geological and environmental data. This framework addresses key agricultural challenges in India, offering a high-accuracy, practical solution for improving both soil classification and crop recommendation. This research delivers state-of-the-art soil classification performance and a robust AI-based crop recommendation tool to support sustainable agricultural practices.}

abstract = {Background
The conceptual definition of epilepsy has been changing over decades and remains debatable. We assessed how artificial intelligence (AI) conceives epilepsy and its impact on a person’s life through verbal and visual material.
Methods
We asked the Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT, OpenAI) to define epilepsy and its impact. Prompts from ChatGPT were transferred to another AI tool DALL·E 2 (Open AI) to generate visual images based on verbal input.
Results
The ChatGPT definition on epilepsy relied on both its conceptual and practical definitions. It titled epilepsy to be “a neurological disorder characterized by recurring seizures” that has significant impact on patients’ lives and is diagnosed after two or more unprovoked seizures or if there is a high risk of future seizures. ChatGPT presented nine issues – seizure-related injuries, limitations on daily activities, emotional and psychological impact, social stigma and isolation, educational and employment challenges, relationship and family dynamics, medication side effects, financial burden, and coexisting conditions – as major consequences of epilepsy. AI-generated images ranged from direct portrayals of these phenomena to abstract imagery but were mostly deprived of symbolic elements and visual metaphors.
Conclusion
We showed that AI can identify and visually interpret the burden of epilepsy from medical, societal and economical perspectives. However, the imagery created is not figurative and does not follow allegorical narratives put forward by epilepsy specialists in similar studies. The ability of AI models to lead an in-depth discussion on epilepsy remains questionable and should be explored with more advanced AI tools.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds significant potential for advancing Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3)—Good Health and Well-being—yet the field remains fragmented across numerous topics and disciplines. In this study, we apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to a final corpus of 60,010 Scopus abstracts after filtering, extracting k = 160 latent topics (selected via metric-based tuning; see Appendix A) and organizing them into a process-oriented, Health Technology Assessment–inspired framework that links Drivers, AI Infrastructure and Methods, Implementation, and Results. Key findings include dominant research streams in disease diagnostics (e.g., breast cancer, cardiovascular disease), personalized treatment, and automation, alongside the emergence of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Geographical mapping highlights Asia, North America, and Europe as research hubs, while underexplored areas such as AI in social media and student education are identified. We also introduce a quadrant-based trend analysis to distinguish “niche excellence” from “leading research areas” and chart short-versus medium-term dynamics. This methodological contribution not only offers a comprehensive “scientific map” of AI–SDG3 research but also provides a scalable blueprint for mapping AI's role across other SDGs and guiding future theory-driven and policy-relevant investigations.}

OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) functions as a high-resolution non-invasive imaging technology that serves multiple applications within ophthalmology and cardiology and dermatology as well as oncology. The adoption of OCT technology showed major diagnostic progress but medical professionals still face obstacles in complex picture interpretation as well as inconsistent accuracy rates. The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that use machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) functions has enabled OCT to analyze images automatically while offering better diagnostic precision.
Methods
The study investigates medical sector applications of OCT technology and scrutinizes how AI facilitates improved clinical performance of OCT.

Results
The medical field underwent a revolutionary change due to OCT technology that enables improved detection of diseases alongside better patient healing outcomes for retinal conditions and cardiovascular problems and epithelial cancer cases. Real-time surgical oncology decision-making occurs through AI by improving both OCT classification of diseases and detection of tumor margins simultaneously. Convolutional neural networks under artificial intelligence control exhibit strong ability to detect normal and abnormal tissues thus enabling earlier cancer detection with improved medical treatment accuracy. Solving active problems with two main issues stands as the key requirement for progress as clinicians work with uncertain model validity and incomplete dataset similarities in clinical settings.
Conclusions
Clinical procedures benefit from important improvements when OCT networks integrate AI command systems in their operations. Future research demands model optimization for AI technology together with the solution of dataset biases and better implementation in medical settings. AI integration with OCT technology points to substantial potential for healthcare detection developments as well as treatment solutions for individual patients in cancer medicine.}

At one end are diseases that are complex and heterogeneous affecting millions, while at the other there are monogenic and rare diseases, with a handful of individuals. What are absent are drugs that can treat or cure the disease. Discovering these is challenging, held back by extreme costs to develop them or in some cases by the limited understanding of the diseases. After decades of drug discovery research there is now considerable data available which can be used to help develop novel compounds more strategically. This includes high throughput screening data with targets, crystal structures of proteins implicated in neurological diseases and adjacent data such as properties of molecules like blood brain barrier permeability as well as an array of in vitro and in vivo toxicity endpoints valuable for any drug targeting the central nervous system. While computational tools have been developing and applied to neurological diseases for decades, we are now in the age of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). This promises the potential to expedite the identification and discovery of new molecules. Whether by using individual computational techniques or complex end-to-end approaches, scientists can narrow the molecules they make and test as well as study more targets or diseases which might have been out of reach previously.

abstract = {Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for future wireless networks, aiming to improve communication efficiency by transmitting only the semantic meaning (or its encoded version) of the source data rather than the complete set of bits (symbols). However, traditional deep learning-based SemCom systems present challenges such as limited generalization, low robustness, and inadequate reasoning capabilities, primarily due to the inherently discriminative nature of deep neural networks. To address these limitations, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is seen as a promising solution, offering notable advantages in learning complex data distributions, transforming data between high- and low-dimensional spaces, and generating high-quality content. This paper explores the applications of GAI in SemCom and presents a comprehensive study. It begins by introducing three widely used SemCom systems enabled by classical GAI models: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. For each system, the fundamental concept of the GAI model, the corresponding SemCom architecture, and a literature review of recent developments are provided. Subsequently, a novel generative SemCom system is proposed, incorporating cutting-edge GAI technology—large language models (LLMs). This system features LLM-based artificial intelligence (AI) agents at both the transmitter and receiver, which act as “brains” to enable advanced information understanding and content regeneration capabilities, respectively. Unlike traditional systems that focus on bitstream recovery, this design allows the receiver to directly generate the desired content from the coded semantic information sent by the transmitter. As a result, the communication paradigm shifts from “information recovery” to “information regeneration,” marking a new era in generative SemCom. A case study on point-to-point video retrieval is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, showing a 99.98% reduction in communication overhead and a 53% improvement in average retrieval accuracy compared to traditional communication systems. Furthermore, four typical application scenarios for generative SemCom are described, followed by a discussion of three open issues for future research. In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive set of guidelines for applying GAI in SemCom, laying the groundwork for the efficient deployment of generative SemCom in future wireless networks.}

In this study, we aimed to identify and consolidate the existing evidence on the diagnostic performances of artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted tools for HPV-related HSILs. We followed the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy and the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy guidelines and systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE, and the Cochrane Library for eligible studies published between 2000 and January 2024. Studies on AI-assisted colposcopy used to facilitate the diagnosis of cervical or anal HSILs and cancers were included. The revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Studies 2 and AI checklists were used to assess the risk of bias. With random-effect models, meta-analyses were performed on performance indicators, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed to identify the sources of heterogeneity. Twenty-five studies, comprising 21 studies focused on cervical cancer and 4 on anal cancer, were included in the meta-analysis. When differentiating from individuals with <cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2)/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL)− (lesion grade <CIN2 or ≤LSIL), the AI-assisted diagnostic tools identified individuals with CIN2+/HSIL+ (lesion grade ≥ CIN2 or ≥ HSIL) at a pooled accuracy of 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81–0.88), sensitivity of 0.87 (0.81–0.93), specificity of 0.85 (0.81–0.89), and AUC of 0.94 (0.91–0.96). For anal cancer, the AI-assisted diagnostic tools differentiated individuals with anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (AIN2)+/HSIL+ (≥AIN2 or ≥HSIL) from those with <AIN2/LSIL− (lesion grade <AIN2 or ≤ LSIL) at a pooled accuracy of 0.90 (95 % CI: 0.88–0.93), sensitivity of 0.94 (0.87–0.99), specificity of 0.88 (0.71–0.98), and AUC of 0.97 (0.95–0.98). All meta-analysis results demonstrated high heterogeneity (I2 > 90 %), but the meta-regression analysis did not reveal any significant contributing sources of heterogeneity. Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of existing literature, we concluded that AI-assisted diagnostic tools have demonstrated promising predictive performance in diagnosing HPV-related cervical and anal precancerous lesions and cancers.}

Key applications are discussed, including the use of advanced ML algorithms, such as support vector machines, random forests, and deep learning techniques, in quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict chemical toxicity based on molecular structures. The chapter also examines how AI enhances environmental monitoring through the analysis of data from satellites, drones, and sensor networks to detect pollution events and assess ecosystem health. Advanced AI techniques like transfer learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) are presented as solutions to challenges such as limited labeled datasets and data scarcity. The importance of explainable AI is highlighted to ensure transparency and trust in model predictions, which is crucial for regulatory acceptance. Current challenges, including data quality issues, model interpretability, computational demands, integration of diverse data types, and ethical considerations, are thoroughly examined. The chapter proposes future directions to overcome these obstacles, such as enhancing data quality through standardized protocols, improving model interpretability with advanced explainable AI techniques, leveraging transfer and federated learning, integrating multiomics data, incorporating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and addressing ethical and legal issues. By adopting these strategies, AI and ML have the potential to significantly advance toxicological research, improve risk assessments, reduce reliance on animal testing, and contribute to public health and environmental protection.}

abstract = {Background
The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, has added complexity and richness to the virtual environment by increasing the presence of AI-generated content (AIGC). Although social media platforms such as TikTok have begun labeling AIGC to facilitate the ability for users to distinguish it from human-generated content, little research has been performed to examine the effect of these AIGC labels.
Objective
This study investigated the impact of AIGC labels on perceived accuracy, message credibility, and sharing intention for misinformation through a web-based experimental design, aiming to refine the strategic application of AIGC labels.
Methods
The study conducted a 2×2×2 mixed experimental design, using the AIGC labels (presence vs absence) as the between-subjects factor and information type (accurate vs inaccurate) and content category (for-profit vs not-for-profit) as within-subjects factors. Participants, recruited via the Credamo platform, were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (with labels) or a control group (without labels). Each participant evaluated 4 sets of content, providing feedback on perceived accuracy, message credibility, and sharing intention for misinformation. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 29 and included repeated-measures ANOVA and simple effects analysis, with significance set at P<.05.
Results
As of April 2024, this study recruited a total of 957 participants, and after screening, 400 participants each were allocated to the experimental and control groups. The main effects of AIGC labels were not significant for perceived accuracy, message credibility, or sharing intention. However, the main effects of information type were significant for all 3 dependent variables (P<.001), as were the effects of content category (P<.001). There were significant differences in interaction effects among the 3 variables. For perceived accuracy, the interaction between information type and content category was significant (P=.005). For message credibility, the interaction between information type and content category was significant (P<.001). Regarding sharing intention, both the interaction between information type and content category (P<.001) and the interaction between information type and AIGC labels (P=.008) were significant.
Conclusions
This study found that AIGC labels minimally affect perceived accuracy, message credibility, or sharing intention but help distinguish AIGC from human-generated content. The labels do not negatively impact users’ perceptions of platform content, indicating their potential for fact-checking and governance. However, AIGC labeling applications should vary by information type; they can slightly enhance sharing intention and perceived accuracy for misinformation. This highlights the need for more nuanced strategies for AIGC labels, necessitating further research.}

abstract = {The proliferation of artificially intelligent (AI) systems in many everyday contexts has emphasized the need to better understand how humans interact with such systems. Previous research has suggested that individuals in many applied contexts believe that these systems are less biased than human counterparts, and thus more trustworthy decision makers. The current study examined whether this common assumption was actually true when placed in a decision-making task that also contains a strong social component (i.e., the Ultimatum Game). Anthropomorphic appearance of AI opponents was also manipulated to determine whether visual appearance also contributes to response behavior. Results indicated that participants treated AI agents identically to humans, and not as non-intelligent (e.g., random number generator-based) systems. This was manifested in both how they responded to offers from the AI system, and also how fairly they subsequently treated the AI opponent. The current results suggest that humans treat AI systems very similarly to other humans, and not as privileged decision makers, which has both positive and negative implications for human-autonomy teaming.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) are the emulation of human intelligence by computer systems. The AI/ML models have made inroads into Computer vision and Quantum computing due to their tremendous ability for reasoning and problem-solving. Computer vision allows computers to interpret visual information (photos, videos) similar to humans while Quantum computers execute complex tasks more efficiently than regular computers. However, how to explain the reasons for specific outputs is an important challenge with AI/ML models when applied to Computer vision and Quantum computing. Without the explainability of the AI/ML, the reliability and validity of Computer vision and Quantum computing outputs, when AI/ML is applied to them, is of great concern for researchers. To solve the issue of trustworthiness and transparency researchers have come up with the idea of explainable AI/ML (XAI). Therefore, to understand the extent of research on XAI in the area of Computer vision and Quantum computing, this study used the existing literature from the Scopus database and statistically presented the results. The study has found that the research on XAI in Computer vision and Quantum computing has been growing particularly since 2019. For AI/ML in Computer vision, the maximum studies on the XAI are in the healthcare sector accounting for 57% followed by autonomous vehicles. As far as AI/ML in Quantum computing is concerned, the majority of XAI research is related to the healthcare sector accounting for 46% followed by cyber security (20%).}

abstract = {The remarkable advancements in machine learning (ML) have led to its extensive adoption in Project Risk Management (PRM), leveraging its powerful predictive capabilities and data-driven insights that support proactive decision-making. Nevertheless, the “black-box” nature of ML models obscures the reasoning behind predictions, undermining transparency and trust. To address this, existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), Global Priors-based LIME (G-LIME), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), have been applied to interpret black-box models. Yet, they face considerable limitations in PRM, including their inability to model cascading effects and multi-level dependencies among risk factors, suffering from inconsistencies due to random sampling, and failure to capture non-linear interactions in high-dimensional risk data. In response to these shortcomings, this paper proposes the Multi-Module eXplainable Artificial Intelligence framework for Project Risk Management (MMXAI-PRM), a novel approach designed to address the unique demands of PRM. The framework consists of three modules: the Risk Relationship Insight Module (RRIM), which models risk dependencies using a Knowledge Graph (KG); the Risk Factor Influence Analysis Module (RFIAM), which introduces a Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network-aided Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations using Kernel Ridge Regression (CTGAN-LIME-KR) to ensure explanation consistency and handle non-linearity; and the Visualization and Interpretation Module (VIM), which synthesizes these insights into an interpretable, chain-based representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMXAI-PRM delivers more consistent, stable, and accurate explanations than existing XAI methods. By improving interpretability, it enhances trust in AI-driven risk predictions and equips project managers with actionable insights, advancing decision-making in PRM.}

Artificial intelligence applications to facilitate foodborne illness outbreak investigations, development of HACCP plans, and food safety root cause analyses at the retail level are needed. For example, the interview form in the International Association for Food Protection booklet, Procedures to Investigate Foodborne Illness, could be filled out by humans, but much of the rest of the forms could be completed by artificial intelligence applications. Humans would still have to do the environmental assessments. Most AI applications to date have consisted of pattern identification. Pattern recognition applications may not be capable of assisting in all the proposed retail applications, but it would not be helpful to propose these retail applications without offering a possible path forward. Progress in the proposed directions may require the development of more robust artificial intelligence based on cognitive models. Because this paradigm shift is less familiar to food safety professionals, a comparison between pattern recognition algorithms and cognitive models is offered. An explanation of cognitive models is included to raise awareness of this approach.}

abstract = {Background
Pharmaceutical manufacturers address health care professionals’ information needs through scientific response documents (SRDs), offering evidence-based answers to medication and disease state questions. Medical information departments, staffed by medical experts, develop SRDs that provide concise summaries consisting of relevant background information, search strategies, clinical data, and balanced references. With an escalating demand for SRDs and the increasing complexity of therapies, medical information departments are exploring advanced technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) tools like large language models (LLMs) to streamline content development. While AI and LLMs show promise in generating draft responses, a synergistic approach combining an LLM with traditional machine learning classifiers in a series of human-supervised and -curated steps could help address limitations, including hallucinations. This will ensure accuracy, context, traceability, and accountability in the development of the concise clinical data summaries of an SRD.
Objective
This study aims to quantify the challenges of SRD development and develop a framework exploring the feasibility and value addition of integrating AI capabilities in the process of creating concise summaries for an SRD.
Methods
To measure the challenges in SRD development, a survey was conducted by phactMI, a nonprofit consortium of medical information leaders in the pharmaceutical industry, assessing aspects of SRD creation among its member companies. The survey collected data on the time and tediousness of various activities related to SRD development. Another working group, consisting of medical information professionals and data scientists, used AI to aid SRD authoring, focusing on data extraction and abstraction. They used logistic regression on semantic embedding features to train classification models and transformer-based summarization pipelines to generate concise summaries.
Results
Of the 33 companies surveyed, 64% (21/33) opened the survey, and 76% (16/21) of those responded. On average, medical information departments generate 614 new documents and update 1352 documents each year. Respondents considered paraphrasing scientific articles to be the most tedious and time-intensive task. In the project’s second phase, sentence classification models showed the ability to accurately distinguish target categories with receiver operating characteristic scores ranging from 0.67 to 0.85 (all P<.001), allowing for accurate data extraction. For data abstraction, the comparison of the bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score and semantic similarity in the paraphrased texts yielded different results among reviewers, with each preferring different trade-offs between these metrics.
Conclusions
This study establishes a framework for integrating LLM and machine learning into SRD development, supported by a pharmaceutical company survey emphasizing the challenges of paraphrasing content. While machine learning models show potential for section identification and content usability assessment in data extraction and abstraction, further optimization and research are essential before full-scale industry implementation. The working group’s insights guide an AI-driven content analysis; address limitations; and advance efficient, precise, and responsive frameworks to assist with pharmaceutical SRD development.}

By automating routine identifications, the system reduces the burden on experts, allowing them to focus on complex or ambiguous cases that require taxonomic expertise. This study focuses on two AIMA operational periods in 2023 and 2024. We evaluate model updates and performance across these years, highlighting both progress achieved and remaining limitations under real-world citizen science conditions. The most reliably classified species across both models were Aedes albopictus and Culex sp., whereas Aedes aegypti remained difficult to identify. Despite its limitations, AIMA remains central to enabling scalable, responsive, and intelligent mosquito vector surveillance, substantially reducing the time experts must devote to routine identifications. Functioning as an Early Warning System (EWS), MA produces real-time distribution maps of invasive species and rapidly delivers actionable information to public health authorities, facilitating timely responses and intervention.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) and mechanistic modeling are becoming essential tools for studying such complex systems. Mechanistic modeling can facilitate the construction of simulatable models that are interpretable but often struggle with scalability and parameters estimation. AI can integrate multi-omics data to create predictive models, but it lacks interpretability. The gap between these two modeling methods limits our ability to develop comprehensive and predictive models for biomedical applications. This article reviews the most recent advancements in the integration of AI and mechanistic modeling to fill this gap. Recently, with omics availability, AI has led to new discoveries in mechanistic computational modeling. The mechanistic models can also help in getting insight into the mechanism for prediction made by AI models. This integration is helpful in modeling complex systems, estimating the parameters that are hard to capture in experiments, and creating surrogate models to reduce computational costs because of expensive mechanistic model simulations. This article focuses on advancements in mechanistic computational models and AI models and their integration for scientific discoveries in biology, pharmacology, drug discovery and diseases. The mechanistic models with AI integration can facilitate biological discoveries to advance our understanding of disease mechanisms, drug development, and personalized medicine.

First, generative AI enables companies to automatically create advertising copy and images, potentially leading to significant cost reductions. Secondly, generative AI offers possibilities to improve and automate personalised marketing, potentially enabling companies to send the right persuasive message at the right time to each potential customer. Thirdly, generative AI potentially offers possibilities to market products to consumers via generative AI chatbots. These developments offer potential advantages but also bear risks for consumers. For example, deepfakes in advertising can mislead consumers, AI-generated personalised marketing can exploit consumer vulnerabilities, and B2C chatbots can deceive consumers by providing biased advice. This article shows that EU law does in principle provide protection to consumers in relation to AI-generated marketing, but is also likely to fall short in effectively protecting consumers against the identified risks in several ways.}

Previous studies reported the impact of vegetation on flow dynamics without providing a precise prediction of flood energy reduction. Therefore, the present study utilized a hybrid artificial intelligence model for the accurate prediction of flood energy reduction. Data series including the hydraulic and geometric conditions of vegetation were collected from the existing literature. Hybrid models, including artificial neural networks, extreme gradient boosting, and support vector regression with Particle Swarm Optimization and random forest, were used. The performance of each artificial intelligence model was evaluated considering the correlation coefficient and mean square error. The result demonstrated superior performance of the extreme gradient boosting with Particle Swarm Optimization model with correlation coefficient and mean square error values of 0.88 and 7.01, respectively. In contrast, an artificial neural network with Particle Swarm Optimization has less predictive power, with correlation coefficient and mean square error values of 0.83 and 7.89. The superior performance of the best model was also confirmed through Analysis of Variance and T-test with P-values of 0.0054 and 0.0062. Furthermore, the best performance of the extreme gradient boosting with Particle Swarm Optimization model was also achieved utilizing Taylor's diagram, in which predicted standard deviation (13.75) matched with measured standard deviation (13.98) compared to other models. The findings of the current research provide insight into the significance of hybrid models, especially the extreme gradient boosting with Particle Swarm Optimization model, while predicting flood energy reduction through vegetation.}

Early detection of cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) after anthracycline exposure is critically important in minimizing morbidity and mortality. Artificial intelligence models applied to electrocardiograms (ECG-AI) may allow for early identification of CTRCD and improved outcomes.
Methods
Patients treated with anthracycline therapy between 2002 and 2022 across three tertiary centers were evaluated. Characteristics, echocardiograms pre- and post-chemotherapy, and outcomes were reviewed. ECG-AI predictive scores for left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) within one year following treatment were collected. ROC analysis was conducted for accuracy of ECG-AI score to detect severe CTRCD (left ventricular ejection fraction <40 %).
Results
Overall, 3439 patients were included, mean age 60.2 ± 14.1 years, 53.6 % male. Severe CTRCD was present in 114 patients. ROC analysis of ECG-AI scores post-initiation of therapy was superior to that of pre-anthracycline ECG-AI scores and had moderate accuracy for detection of severe CTRCD (AUC 0.761). An ECG-AI score >3.0 % was independently associated with significantly poorer survival at one year (HR 2.19, 95 %CI 1.92-2.51) and five years (HR 1.69, 95 %CI 1.54-1.87) post-anthracycline therapy.
Conclusions
ECG-AI indicating increased likelihood for LVSD post-anthracycline therapy accurately detected severe CTRCD. Clinically, this tool may allow early diagnosis and treatment of high-risk patients and may reduce unnecessary surveillance in those with lower risk.}

Using Artificial Intelligence driven fall detection with Explainable Artificial Intelligence for transparent decision-making, this methodology presents a robust approach to improving accuracy and reducing false alarms in real-world healthcare settings. The study demonstrates that combining advanced filtering techniques with Explainable Artificial Intelligence algorithms successfully overcomes the challenges associated with traditional fall detection systems. The findings further confirm that the application of an Artificial Intelligence based Butterworth filter significantly enhances model accuracy, achieving 98.96% compared to 79.77% without filtering.

This study addresses this gap in the literature by investigating the relationship between AI and ENS within the framework of Porter's theory. Furthermore, it also considers the environmental impact of clean energy use, human capital, economic growth, and natural resources. The empirical analysis utilizes Fourier-based econometric methods. The analysis findings show that AI has no statistically significant impact on ENS. In other words, although low-carbon AI facilities have increased in France in recent years, they are still not capable of improving environmental quality. Thus, this study reveals that low-carbon technologies capable of meeting AI's intense energy demands are insufficient. Other results of the paper indicate that economic growth and natural resources reduce environmental quality. Furthermore, the use of clean energy and human capital contribute to ENS. The French government should significantly increase the number of low-carbon AI facilities. Public-private partnerships can build energy infrastructure, enabling AI's positive environmental impact to be realized in the future.

abstract = {Background
The use of multiple medications increases the risk of harmful drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Conventional DDI screening databases vary in coverage and often trigger low-relevance alerts, contributing to alert fatigue. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as potential tools for DDI identification, however, their performance compared to established databases using real-world patient data remains under-explored.
Methods
In this exploratory study, we compared conventional database screening with LLM-based screening using anonymized medication lists from rheumatology patients. Lexicomp, Medscape and Drugs.com were used to compile a reference set of 204 clinically relevant interactions across 57 cases. Using identical prompts, we then queried ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot for interactions potentially requiring pharmacists' intervention. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1 score.
Results
Compared to the reference set of 204 DDIs, ChatGPT identified 439, Gemini 1556, and Copilot 1813 potential interactions. While Gemini achieved the highest sensitivity (0.697), ChatGPT demonstrated higher specificity (0.868). All three platforms demonstrated low precision scores. Overall, ChatGPT achieved the highest performance by F1 score (0.2520), followed by Gemini (0.1933) and Copilot (0.1153). Our results suggest that no AI systems assessed achieve the required balance of precision and sensitivity for reliable clinical decision-making in DDI screening.
Conclusion
Although LLMs show promise as complementary tools in DDI screening, as they proved effective in identifying true interactions, they generate clinically inaccurate information due to hallucinations, which limits their reliability as standalone screening tools. Consequently, while LLMs could support clinical pharmacists in polypharmacy management, their outputs must always undergo professional validation to ensure patient safety.}

abstract = {Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) represent a group of heterogeneous mesenchymal tumors of which are generally classified as per the histopathology. Despite being rare in incidence and prevalence, STSs are usually correlated with unfavorable prognosis and high mortality rate. Early and accurate diagnosis of STSs are critical in clinical management of STSs. Deep learning (DL) refers to a subtype of artificial intelligence that has been adopted to assist healthcare professionals to optimize personalized treatment for a given situation, particularly in image analysis. Recently, emerging studies have demonstrated that application of DL based on medical images could substantially improve the accuracy and efficiency of clinicians to the identification, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis prediction of STSs, and thereby facilitating the clinical decision-making. Herein, we aimed to extensively summarize the recent applications of DL-based artificial intelligence in STSs from the aspects of data acquisition, algorithm, and model establishment. Besides, the reinforcement of the model by transfer learning and generative adversarial network (GAN) for data augmentation has also been elaborated. It is worth noting that high-quality data with accurate annotations, as well as optimized algorithmic performance are pivotal in the clinical application of DL in STSs.}

abstract = {With the rising role of artificial intelligence (AI) and its components in every sphere of development, healthcare is one sector that demands it most. With the availability of huge datasets, apps, wearables, robots as interventionists, deep learning, and neural-based networking, a comprehensive approach toward looking at health has emerged. This chapter aims to understand how these technological innovations have completely transformed one of the foundations of every grown human being, that is, “developmental pediatrics.” This chapter highlights four major components that ensure the significant role of AI in pediatrics. The first section highlights an introduction to pediatrics and its growth, the second section relates to technological advancement in this area, the third section elaborates on generative AI and its growing role across the globe and in pediatric development, the fourth section talks about technology, methods, tools, and progression of AI in the field, and further sections discusses challenges, opportunities as futuristic growth, essentials, and finally the takeaways from the discussion. This chapter holds significant importance specifically in pediatrics and is an important consideration to be understood before expecting groundbreaking results from application and serves as a ready reference for varied aspects of applied benefits in different areas of pediatrics right from cardiology to radiology and the role of precision medicine.}
